    "html": "<p>She who was never speechless when she ruled as &ldquo;Mistress of Kingdoms&rdquo; is silenced at last. The Harlot Babylon&rsquo;s ceaseless din ends (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgwNTUiOjJ9LHsiMTgxMDQiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 22:2, 13; 24:8<\/a>) when Jehovah reverses Babylon&rsquo;s and Zion&rsquo;s circumstances, blessing Zion but cursing Babylon. Although Jehovah permits the Harlot Babylon to oppress and humble his people&mdash;as a covenant curse for their breaking his covenant&mdash;when they repent, he redeems them and they become candidates for higher spiritual categories. In the end, the Harlot Babylon&rsquo;s violation of Zion&rsquo;s rights brings upon her the curses of Jehovah&rsquo;s covenant with his people.<\/p><p>The terms <em>hand<\/em> and <em>yoke<\/em> designate the king of Assyria\/Babylon, who punishes Jehovah&rsquo;s people and takes them captive (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc3NjUiOjF9LHsiMTc4NTUiOjR9LHsiMTg2OTEiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 5:25; 10:4-7; 51:17<\/a>). From that captivity Jehovah releases those who repent after it has served its purpose (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc4MzIiOjN9LHsiMTc4NzUiOjR9LHsiMTc5NTMiOjR9XQ==\">Isaiah 9:2-4; 10:24-27; 14:24-27<\/a>). While the Harlot Babylon and her king assume they are invulnerable, they forget that Jehovah is in charge, that his purpose is to raise up an exalted people of God. The &ldquo;Eternal Mistress&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t eternal. She should have considered &ldquo;these&rdquo; (<em>&rsquo;elleh<\/em>)&mdash;Jehovah&rsquo;s elect people&mdash;who inherit his everlasting salvation (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg1NzkiOjF9LHsiMTg2ODAiOjN9LHsiMTg4MzYiOjh9XQ==\">Isaiah 45:17; 51:6-8; 60:14-21<\/a>).<\/p>",
