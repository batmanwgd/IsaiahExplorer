This crime has always been one particularly offensive in the sight of God; see the note at <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc2NzgiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 1:23<\/a>. The widow and the orphan are without protectors. Judges, by their office, are particularly bound to preserve their rights; and it, therefore, evinces special iniquity when they who should be their protectors become, in fact, their oppressors, and do injustice to them without the possibility of redress. Yet this was the character of the Jewish judges; and for this the vengeance of heaven was about to come upon the land.<\/p>",
