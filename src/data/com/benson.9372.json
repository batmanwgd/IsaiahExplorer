The everlasting, and unchangeable, and omnipotent God, who therefore both can and will fulfil all my promises. <i>That is my name <\/i>\u2014 Which I must own and justify to the world. He seems to allude to <a class=\"ref\">Exodus 3:14; Exodus 6:3<\/a>. <i>My glory will I not give to another <\/i>\u2014 I will not any longer suffer that honour and worship which are peculiar to me to be given to idols, as it hath been, but I will, by the Messiah and his gospel, abolish idolatry out of the world. <i>Behold, the former things are come to pass <\/i>\u2014 As all things which I have formerly promised or foretold, have exactly come to pass in their proper seasons, and not one of them has failed; so you have great reason to believe that what I now promise, though it be new and strange to you, shall infallibly be accomplished. <i>Before they spring forth I tell you of them <\/i>\u2014 That when they come to pass you may know that I am God, and that this is my work. <\/p>",
