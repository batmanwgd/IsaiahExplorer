    "html": "<p><i>Then shall the erring in spirit learn wisdom. <\/i>He again repeats that promise which he formerly noticed briefly; for so long as the understandings of men shall be struck with ignorance and blindness, even though they enjoy abundance of every kind of blessings, yet they are always surrounded and besieged by ruin. In making preparation for the restoration of the Church, the Lord therefore enlightens by his word, and illuminates by the light of understanding, his own people, who formerly wandered astray in darkness. He does this by the secret influence of the Spirit; for it would be of little value to be taught by the external word, if he did not also instruct our hearts inwardly. <\/p>\n<p><i>And the murmurers shall learn doctrine. <\/i>Some commentators translate  <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05e8\u05d5\u05d2\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd<\/span> (<i>r\u014dg\u0115n\u012bm<\/i>) \u201cwhisperers,\u201d and others, \u201cwanderers.\u201d But it means that those who formerly murmured against the prophets, and could not endure their warnings, would be obedient and submissive; and therefore I have chosen to render it <i>murmurers<\/i>. Hence we see how wonderful is the mercy of God, who brings back into the path those who were highly unworthy, and makes them partakers of so great blessings. Let us carefully ponder this subject in private. Is there any one of us that has not sometimes \u201cmurmured\u201d against God, and despised pure doctrine? Nay, more, if God had not softened the obstinate, and brought them mildly to obey, nearly the whole human race would have perished in their madness. <\/p>",
