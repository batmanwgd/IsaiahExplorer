Our Lord, who quotes this passage, <a class=\"ref\">John 6:45<\/a>, applies it to gospel grace, and represents it as having its accomplishment in all those that are brought savingly to believe in him. <i>And great shall be the peace of thy children <\/i>\u2014<\/p>\n<p>1st, Inward peace, arising from clear discoveries of God\u2019s love, and his reconciliation to us, and wrought by the Spirit of adoption, which is more abundantly given to believers under the gospel than under the law. 2d, Outward peace, safety, and happiness, which is more fully promised in the following verses, and which God, when he sees fit, will confer upon his church. <i>In righteousness shalt thou be established <\/i>\u2014 This kingdom shall be set up and established, not by injustice, fraud, or tyranny, as other kingdoms frequently are, but upon a righteous foundation, and by the exercise of righteousness and holiness, which is the glory and felicity of any society. <i>Thou shalt be far from oppression <\/i>\u2014 Either by thine own governors, or by foreign powers. Those that have oppressed thee shall be removed; those that would oppress thee shall be restrained; and therefore thou <i>shalt not fear <\/i>\u2014 Thou shalt neither have any just cause of fear, nor be given up to the torment of fear without cause.<\/p>",
