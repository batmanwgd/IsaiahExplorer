He moreover reigned over the Bactrians, Indians, Cilicians, the Sac\u00e6, Paphlagones, and Mariandyni.\u201d All these kingdoms he acknowledges, in his decree for the restoration of the Jews, to have been given him by Jehovah, the God of heaven, <a class=\"ref\">Ezra 1:2<\/a>. <i>And I will loose the loins of kings <\/i>\u2014 I will weaken them, and render them unprepared and unable to oppose Cyrus. \u201cThe eastern people, wearing long and loose garments, were unfit for action or business of any kind, without girding their clothes about them: when their business was finished, they took off their girdles. A girdle, therefore, denotes strength and activity; and to <i>unloose the girdle <\/i>is to deprive of strength, to render unfit for action.\u201d <i>To open before him the two-leaved gates <\/i>\u2014 \u201cThe gates of Babylon, within the city, leading from the streets to the river, were providentially left open in the night when Cyrus\u2019s forces entered the city through the channel of the river, in the general disorder occasioned by the great feast which was then celebrated: otherwise, says Herodotus, the Persians would have been shut up in the bed of the river, and taken as in a net, and all destroyed. And the gates of the palace were opened imprudently by the king\u2019s orders, to inquire what was the cause of the tumult without, when two parties of Medes and Persians rushed in, got possession of the palace, and slew the king.\u201d See Xenoph. <i>Cyrop., 7. <\/i>p. 528; and Bishop Lowth.<\/p>",
