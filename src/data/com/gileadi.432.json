    "html": "<p>Proxy salvation may extend to divine intervention, as in this case, when a proxy savior intercedes with God on the seraph level. The person doing so here, however, is not Hezekiah but Isaiah (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODc0NCI6M30=\">vv 3-5<\/a>). While Hezekiah fulfills the role of a proxy savior of his people on the son\/servant level (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W10=\">vv 15-20<\/a>), Isaiah intercession on a higher level results in a greater deliverance. At Assyria&rsquo;s siege of Jerusalem, loyalties to Jehovah are thus tested on three ascending levels&mdash;Zion\/Jerusalem, sons\/servants, and seraphs&mdash;establishing a pattern in Jehovah&rsquo;s dealings with his covenant people that applies to the end of time.<\/p>",
