    "html": "<p>Those who don&rsquo;t repent in time to participate in the exodus of Jehovah&rsquo;s elect to Zion must fend for themselves among the nations. As aliens are often suspect, people return to their own countries for safety. Still, as &ldquo;deer&rdquo; and &ldquo;sheep&rdquo; are ritually clean animals, those who flee represent a category of Jehovah&rsquo;s people. Comprising neither the &ldquo;holy&rdquo; and &ldquo;valiant&rdquo; souls whom Jehovah gathers out of destruction in the new exodus (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTg5MDE=\">v 3<\/a>), nor the wicked who perish (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4OTA3LDE4OTA5XQ==\">vv 9, 11<\/a>), this middle category, too, learns by experience what Jehovah desires to teach his people and to whom they may turn for help.<\/p>",
