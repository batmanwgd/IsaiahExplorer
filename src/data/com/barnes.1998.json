    "html": "<p><em>Your iniquities<\/em>&mdash;Their idolatry and their forsaking God, and their arts of necromancy.<\/p><p><em>And the iniquities of your fathers together<\/em>&mdash;The consequences of your own sins, and of the long defection of the nation from virtue and pure religion, shall come rushing upon you like accumulated floods. This is in accordance with the Scripture doctrine everywhere, that the consequences of the sins of ancestors pass over and visit their posterity (see <a class=\"ref\">Exodus 20:5; Exodus 34:7; Numbers 14:18; Job 21:19; Luke 11:50-51<\/a> ; the notes at <a class=\"ref\">Romans 5:19<\/a>). The case here was, that the nation had been characteristically prone to wander from God, and to fall into idolatry. Crime had thus been accumulating, like pent-up waters, for ages, and now it swept away every barrier. So crime often accumulates in a nation. Age after age rolls on, and it is unpunished, until it breaks over every obstacle, and all that is valuable and happy is swept suddenly away.<\/p><p><em>Which have burnt incense upon the mountains<\/em>&mdash;(See the notes at <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg5MDEiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 65:3<\/a>).<\/p><p><em>And blasphemed me upon the hills<\/em>&mdash;That is, they have dishonored me by worshipping idols, and by denying me in that public manner. Idols were usually worshipped on high places.<\/p><p><em>Will I measure their former work<\/em>&mdash;I will recompense them; I will pour the reward of their work or of their doings into their bosom.<\/p>",
