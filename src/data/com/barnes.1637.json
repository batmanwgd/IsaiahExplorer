    "html": "<p><em>Who hath formed a god<\/em>&mdash;The Septuagint reads this verse in connection with the close of the previous verse, &lsquo;But they shall be ashamed who make a god, and all who sculpture unprofitable things.&rsquo; This interpretation also, Lowth, by a change in the Hebrew text on the authority of a manuscript in the Bodleian library, has adopted. This change is made by reading \u05db\u05d9 k\u0131\u0302y instead of \u05de\u05d9 m\u0131\u0302y in the beginning of the verse. But the authority of the change, being that of a single MS. and the Septuagint, is not sufficient. Nor is it necessary. The question is designed to be ironical and sarcastic: &lsquo;Who is there,&rsquo; says the prophet, &lsquo;that has done this? Who are they that are engaged in this stupid work? Do they give marks of a sound mind? What is, and must be the character of a man that bas formed a god, and that has made an unprofitable graven image?<\/p>",
