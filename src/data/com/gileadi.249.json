Jehovah&rsquo;s intent, however, is to cause the wicked to &ldquo;turn back&rdquo; to him&mdash;to &ldquo;repent&rdquo; and &ldquo;return&rdquo;&mdash;so that he may heal them. He heals them when at last they &ldquo;see with their eyes and hear with their ears, understand in their heart, and repent, and are healed&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTc3ODA=\">Isaiah 6:10<\/a>; cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">58:1-8<\/a>).
