    "html": "<p><a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 48:1&ndash;2<\/a>describes Israel&rsquo;s apostasy from God&rsquo;s revealed ways. While these chosen people of the Lord have &ldquo;come forth out of the waters of &hellip; baptism&rdquo; (<a class=\"ref\">1 Nephi 20:1<\/a>; compare <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 48:1&ndash;2<\/a>with <a class=\"ref\">1 Nephi 20:1&ndash;2<\/a>), &ldquo;they do not stay themselves upon the &hellip; Lord&rdquo; (<a class=\"ref\">1 Nephi 20:2<\/a>). In other words, they have apostatized. For this reason, the Lord elected to demonstrate His powers of omniscience. He had, He told them, &ldquo;declared &hellip; things from the beginning,&rdquo; that is, He spoke of them before their occurrence, and then &ldquo;shewed them &hellip; suddenly&rdquo; by bringing them to pass (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTg2MTg=\">Isaiah 48:3<\/a>). This He had done, He said, lest the apostates should say, &ldquo;Mine idol hath done them&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTg2MjA=\">v. 5<\/a>), or &ldquo;Behold, I knew them&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTg2MjI=\">v. 7<\/a>), that is to say, &ldquo;I already knew that.&rdquo; The Lord then promised to defer His anger but utterly refused to give His glory to false gods or to suffer His name to be polluted (compare <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTg2MjY=\">v. 11<\/a> with <a class=\"ref\">1 Nephi 20:11<\/a>). Thus the Lord&rsquo;s purpose for revealing the future unto man is partly made clear: it is the solid proof that He is truly God, for no mute idol could possibly duplicate such a feat.<\/p><p class=\"cite\">LDS Church Educational System Old Testament Student Manual, 1 Kings&ndash;Malachi, Religion 302, Chapter 17, Item 3<\/p>",
