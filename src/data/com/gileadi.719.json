    "html": "<p>A polarization of peoples takes place as Jehovah&rsquo;s coming to the earth draws near. Although the number of wicked people increases and the number of righteous decreases, the degree of wickedness of the wicked is in part offset by the degree of righteousness of the righteous as there is more evil to overcome that serves as a test of their covenantal loyalty. Being the espoused wife that proves unfaithful, Jehovah&rsquo;s &ldquo;nation\/people&rdquo; who currently claim allegiance to him largely apostatize while Jehovah&rsquo;s servants minister to the wife whom Jehovah remarries (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3sic2luZ2xlcyI6WzE4NzI1XX0seyIxNzcxNiI6Mn0seyIxODY1OSI6Mn0seyIxODcyOCI6NX0seyIxODg1NiI6N31d\">vv 8-9; Isaiah 49:22-23; 54:1, 4-8; 62:1-7<\/a>).<\/p><p>Although Jehovah makes himself &ldquo;available&rdquo; and &ldquo;accessible&rdquo; to all his people at the time his servant fulfills his mission (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3sic2luZ2xlcyI6WzE4NjczLDE4NzA0LDE4NzEyXX0seyIxODc0NSI6NH1d\">Isaiah 50:10; 52:7, 15; 55:4-7<\/a>), most spurn the servant and by so doing spurn Jehovah.

Instead of adopting Jehovah&rsquo;s &ldquo;way,&rdquo; they assume they know of themselves. Defiant toward his <em>hand<\/em> of deliverance (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3sic2luZ2xlcyI6WzE4NjY1LDE4NjcyXX0seyIxODU3MSI6M30seyIxODgwMiI6Mn1d\">Isaiah 45:9-11; 50:2, 9; 59:1-2<\/a>), they become subject to his <em>hand<\/em> of punishment (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzY1LDE3ODU2LDE4MTQyXQ==\">Isaiah 5:25; 10:5; 26:11<\/a>).<\/p>",
