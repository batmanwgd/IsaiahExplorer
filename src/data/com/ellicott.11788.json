It seems better, however, to see in the words an expression of the law of inherited retribution, which entered so largely into the Hebrew\u2019s thought of the moral government of the world. That law will show itself in the prostrate homage with which the descendants of the old oppressors will recognise that the restored city is indeed the Zion of the Holy One of Israel.<\/p>",
