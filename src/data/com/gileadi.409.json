He sees Hezekiah&rsquo;s purifying the ecclesiastical establishment of his day as a bad thing for the people of Judah, whereas to Hezekiah his doing so eliminates the alien forms of idolatry that tainted his people&rsquo;s worship of Jehovah (<a class=\"ref\">2 Kings 18:4<\/a>). The words &ldquo;this altar&rdquo; refer to the Jerusalem temple, which contains the altar on which the priests offer sacrifice (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc2NjYiOjF9LHsiMTc3NzYiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 1:11; 6:6<\/a>). In an end-time context, &ldquo;Judea&rdquo; and &ldquo;Jerusalem&rdquo; function as codenames of Jehovah&rsquo;s people living in that day.<\/p>",
