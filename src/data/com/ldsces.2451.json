    "html": "<p><a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg4NzciOjEwfV0=\">Isaiah 63:10&ndash;19<\/a>depicts a people gone astray, a people who have broken their covenants with the Lord. These verses explain the great judgment of the earth described in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg4NzYiOjF9XQ==\">verses 1&ndash;9<\/a>. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc2NTYiOjMxfV0=\">verse 17<\/a> in the Joseph Smith Translation contains a significant alteration. Instead of &ldquo;O Lord, why hast thou made us to err from thy ways and hardened our heart,&rdquo; it reads, &ldquo;O Lord, why hast thou suffered us to err from thy ways, and to harden our heart?&rdquo; God does not compel people to sin or to harden their hearts. It is possible that the last part of verse 17 is a plea for the Lord to restore the lost tribes of Israel to the lands of their inheritance (see <a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 133:23&ndash;33<\/a>).<\/p><p class=\"cite\">LDS Church Educational System Old Testament Student Manual, 1 Kings&ndash;Malachi, Religion 302, Chapter 18, Item 23<\/p>",
