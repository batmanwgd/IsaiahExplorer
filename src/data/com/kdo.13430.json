    "html": "<p>When Jehovah has thus acknowledged His people once more, the heathen, to whose <i>(<span class=\"translit\">giddu\u0304ph\u0131\u0304m<\/span>) (blasphemies) Israel has hitherto been given up, will count it the greatest honour to belong to Jehovah and His people. <i>\u201cOne will say, I belong to Jehovah; and a second will solemnly name the name of Jacob; and a third will inscribe himself to Jehovah, and name the name of Israel with honour.\u201d<\/i> The threefold <i>(<span class=\"translit\">zeh<\/span>) refers to the heathen, as in <a class=\"ref\">Psalm 87:4-5<\/a>. One will declare himself to belong to Jehovah; another will call with the name of Jacob, i.e., (according to the analogy of the phrase <span class=\"normal hebrew\">\u05d4<\/span> <span class=\"normal hebrew\">\u05d1\u05e9\u05c1\u05dd<\/span> <span class=\"normal hebrew\">\u05e7\u05e8\u05d0<\/span>) make it the medium and object of solemn exclamation; a third will write with his hand (<span class=\"normal hebrew\">\u05d9\u05d3\u05d5<\/span>, an acc. of more precise definition, like <span class=\"normal hebrew\">\u05d7\u05de\u05d4<\/span> in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTg1MDY=\">Isaiah 42:25<\/a>, and <span class=\"normal hebrew\">\u05d6\u05d1\u05d9\u05d7\u05da<\/span> in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTg1Mjk=\">Isaiah 43:23<\/a>), \u201cTo Jehovah,\u201d thereby attesting that he desires to belong to Jehovah, and Jehovah alone. This is the explanation given by Gesenius, Hahn, and others; whereas Hitzig and Knobel follow the lxx in the rendering, \u201che will write upon his hand '(<span class=\"translit\">\u201blayeho\u0304va\u0302h<\/span>),' i.e., mark the name of Jehovah upon it.\u201d But apart from the fact that (<span class=\"translit\">ka\u0302thabh<\/span>), with an accusative of the writing materials, would be unprecedented (the construction required would be <span class=\"normal hebrew\">\u05e2\u05dc\u05be\u05d9\u05d3\u05d5<\/span>), this view is overthrown by the fact that tatooing was prohibited by the Israelitish law (<a class=\"ref\">Leviticus 19:28<\/a>; compare the mark of the beast in <a class=\"ref\">Revelation 13:16<\/a>). <span class=\"normal hebrew\">\u05d1\u05e9\u05c1\u05dd<\/span> <span class=\"normal hebrew\">\u05e7\u05e8\u05d0<\/span> is interchanged with <span class=\"normal hebrew\">\u05d1\u05e1\u05dd<\/span> <span class=\"normal hebrew\">\ufb3b\ufb40\u05d4<\/span>, to surname, or entitle (the Syriac and Arabic are the same; compare the Arabic (<span class=\"translit\">kunye<\/span>), the name given to a man as the father of such and such a person, e.g., Abu-Muhammed<\/i>, rhetorically called metonymy). The name Israel<\/i> becomes a name or title of honour among the heathen. This concludes the fourth prophecy, which opens out into three distinct fields. With <span class=\"normal hebrew\">\u05d5\u05e2\ufb4a\u05d4<\/span> in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTg1MzU=\">Isaiah 44:1<\/a> it began to approach the close, just as the third did in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTg1MDc=\">Isaiah 43:1<\/a> -a well-rounded whole, which leaves nothing wanting.<br><\/p>",
