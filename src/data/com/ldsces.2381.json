    "html": "<p>Isaiah recorded the singing of the &ldquo;new song&rdquo; <em>after<\/em> he recorded the restoration of the gospel. The song is unique in that only those who are sanctified are worthy to sing it (compare <a class=\"ref\">Revelation 14:1&ndash;3<\/a>). The same spirit is reflected in <a class=\"ref\">Doctrine and Covenants 84:98&ndash;102<\/a>. In another instance, the song is simply called the &ldquo;song of the Lamb&rdquo; (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 133:56&ndash;57<\/a>).<\/p><p class=\"cite\">LDS Church Educational System Old Testament Student Manual, 1 Kings&ndash;Malachi, Religion 302, Chapter 16, Item 20<\/p>",
