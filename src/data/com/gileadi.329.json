When things reach that point&mdash;when a simple farmer&rsquo;s inspiration (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W10=\">vv 26, 29<\/a>) surpasses that of his people&rsquo;s leaders (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTg2NzA=\">vv 7, 15<\/a>)&mdash;Jehovah sets his house in order (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3sic2luZ2xlcyI6WzE4OTI5XX0seyIxNzY4MCI6Mn1d\">Isaiah 1:25-26; 66:6<\/a>). The terms &ldquo;wonderful counsel&rdquo; establish word links to Jehovah&rsquo;s servant&mdash;&ldquo;the man who performs my counsel&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTg1OTg=\">Isaiah 46:11<\/a>), upon whom rests the &ldquo;spirit of counsel&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTc4ODc=\">Isaiah 11:2<\/a>), and who exemplifies the function of a &ldquo;wonderful counselor&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTc4MzY=\">Isaiah 9:6<\/a>).<\/p><p>Each poetic allegory (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W10=\">vv 23-26, 27-29<\/a>) reiterates chapter 28&rsquo;s theme of the need for divine revelation and its lack among the people of Ephraim that leaves them unprepared for Jehovah&rsquo;s Day of Judgment.
