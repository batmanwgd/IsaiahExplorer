Residents who formerly &ldquo;infested&rdquo; its buildings and housing areas, who &ldquo;lodged&rdquo; in crowded, &ldquo;overflowing&rdquo; conditions, now have their counterparts in &ldquo;wild animals,&rdquo; &ldquo;weasels,&rdquo; &ldquo;birds of prey,&rdquo; and &ldquo;demonic creatures.&rdquo; The entertainers who formerly &ldquo;pranced about&rdquo; and &ldquo;cried out&rdquo; in its &ldquo;palaces&rdquo; and &ldquo;amusement halls&rdquo; are now represented by &ldquo;jackals&rdquo; and &ldquo;howling creatures.&rdquo; Like a pregnancy gone wrong, Babylon&rsquo;s days are numbered and she doesn&rsquo;t survive her ordeal.<\/p>",
