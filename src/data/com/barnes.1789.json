    "html": "<p><em>I have taken out of thy hand the cup of trembling<\/em>&mdash;(See the notes at <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTg2OTE=\">Isaiah 51:17<\/a> ). This verse contains a promise that they would be delivered from the effect of the wrath of God, under which they had been suffering so long.<\/p><p><em>Thou shalt no more drink it again<\/em>&mdash;Thou shalt no more be subject to similar trials and calamities (see <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 54:7-9<\/a>). Probably the idea here is, not that Jerusalem would never be again destroyed, which would not be true, for it was afterward subjected to severer trials under the Romans; but that the people who should then return&mdash;the pious exiles&mdash;should be preserved forever after from similar sufferings. The object of the prophet is to console them, and this he does by the assurance that they should be subjected to such trials no more.<\/p>",
