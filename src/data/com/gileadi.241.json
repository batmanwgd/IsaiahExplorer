    "html": "<p>The covenant curse of withering vegetation&mdash;synchronized with a plethora of other misfortunes&mdash;afflicts Egypt as its vibrant society wanes like the vegetation itself. Egypt&rsquo;s flora epitomize the transitory nature of life for its corrupt inhabitants (cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3sic2luZ2xlcyI6WzE3NzY0LDE4MzgwLDE4NDQ1XX0seyIxODQyNyI6M31d\">Isaiah 5:24; 37:27; 40:6-8, 24<\/a>). Foliage that &ldquo;shrivels and blows away and is no more&rdquo; typifies the fate awaiting them and all who comprise Greater Babylon. Egypt&rsquo;s bodies of water that dry up and rivers that turn foul, too, are a metaphor of its people (cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MDAwLDE4MDA1LDE4Mzc4LDE4NDk2XQ==\">Isaiah 18:2, 7; 37:25; 42:15<\/a>), their pollution and evaporation signifying their descent into chaos.<\/p>",
