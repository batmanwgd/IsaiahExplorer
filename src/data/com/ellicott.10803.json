    "html": "<p>             (2) In that day . . .\u2014The dark picture of punishment is relieved by a vision of Messianic glory, like that of <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 2:1-4<\/a>. The \u201cday\u201d is, as in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTc3MjY=\">Isaiah 3:18<\/a>, the time of Jehovah\u2019s judgments.<\/p>\n <p>The branch of the Lord . . .\u2014The thought of the \u201cbranch,\u201d though not the Hebrew word, is the same as in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTc4ODY=\">Isaiah 11:1<\/a>. The word itself is found in the Messianic prophecies of <a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 23:5-6; Jeremiah 33:15; Zechariah 3:8; Zechariah 6:12<\/a>. The two latter probably inherited both the thought and the word from this passage. Here, then, if we thus interpret the words, we have the first distinct prophecy in Isaiah of a personal Messiah. He is the \u201cBranch of Jehovah,\u201d raised up by Him, accepted by Him. And the appearance of that Branch has as its accompaniment (the poetic parallelism here being that at once of a resemblance and of contrast) the restoration of outward fertility. That thought Isaiah had inherited from <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 72:16; Hosea 2:21-22; Joel 3:18; Amos 9:13<\/a>. He transmitted it to <a class=\"ref\">Ezekiel 34:27; Zechariah 9:16-17<\/a>. The interpretation which takes \u201cthe branch [or growth] of the Lord\u201d in its lower sense, as used collectively for \u201cvegetation,\u201d and, therefore, parallel and all but synonymous with the \u201cfruits of the earth,\u201d seems to miss the true meaning. Rabbinic exegesis may be of little weight, but the acceptance of the term as Messianic by Jeremiah and Zechariah is surely conclusive. It will be noted that the prophecy of the Branch (tsemach) here comes after a picture of desolation, just as that of the Branch (netzer) does in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTc4ODY=\">Isaiah 11:1<\/a>. The thought seems applied by our Lord to Himself in <a class=\"ref\">John 12:24<\/a>.<\/p>\n <p>For them that are escaped of Israel.\u2014These are, of course, identical with the \u201cremnant\u201d of <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTc2NjQ=\">Isaiah 1:9<\/a>; <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTc3ODM=\">Isaiah 6:13<\/a>, to whom the prophet had been taught to look as to the trusted depositaries of the nation\u2019s future.<\/p>",
