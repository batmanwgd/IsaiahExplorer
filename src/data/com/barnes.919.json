Their names were significant, and were designed to illustrate some important truth; and especially the prophet here intimates that they were to inculcate the truth in regard to the presence and protection of God, to induce the people to look to him. Thus the name immanuel, &lsquo;God with us,&rsquo; <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTc3OTc=\">Isaiah 7:14<\/a> ; and Shear-jashub, &lsquo;the remnant shall return,&rsquo; <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTc3ODY=\">Isaiah 7:3<\/a> , were both significant of the fact that none but God could be the protector of the nation. And in like manner, it is possible that his own name, signifying the salvation of Jehovah, had been given him with such a reference. But at all events, it was a name which would remind them of the truth that he was now inculcating, that salvation was to be found in Yahweh, and that they should look to him. Names of children were often thus emblematic (see <a class=\"ref\">Hosea 1:1-11<\/a> ); and the prophets themselves were regarded as signs of important events; <a class=\"ref\">Ezekiel 24:24<\/a> ; compare the note at <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTgwMzM=\">Isaiah 20:3<\/a>. This passage is quoted with reference to the Messiah in <a class=\"ref\">Hebrews 2:13<\/a>.<\/p><p><em>Which dwelleth in mount Zion<\/em>&mdash;Mount Zion was the residence of the house of David, or of the court, and it was often used to signify Jerusalem itself. The sense here is, that God was the protector of Jerusalem, or regarded that as his home; see the note at <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTc2NjM=\">Isaiah 1:8<\/a>.<\/p>",
