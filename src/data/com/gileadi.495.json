Whatever weapon is devised against you, it shall not succeed; every tongue that rises to accuse you, you shall refute. This is the heritage of the servants of Jehovah, and such is their vindication by me,&rsquo; says Jehovah&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODc0MCI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 54:16-17<\/a>). No matter how bleak their prospects may appear, his people have only to trust in their God.<\/p><p>Unlike Israel&rsquo;s exodus out of Egypt, the end-time exodus of Jehovah&rsquo;s people is from all parts of the earth: &ldquo;He will raise the ensign to the nations and assemble the exiled of Israel; he will gather the scattered of Judah from the four directions of the earth&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTc4OTc=\">Isaiah 11:12<\/a>). Like the exodus out of Egypt, however, the end-time exodus of Jehovah&rsquo;s people is out of bondage, compelling the north&mdash;Assyria&mdash;to &ldquo;give up&rdquo;; and the south&mdash;Egypt&mdash;to &ldquo;withhold not.&rdquo; Jehovah&rsquo;s servant follows the pattern of Moses, whom Jehovah chose as Israel&rsquo;s deliverer (<a class=\"ref\">Exodus 3-13<\/a>; <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3sic2luZ2xlcyI6WzE4NjQ2XX0seyIxNzg3NSI6NH0seyIxODY2MSI6Mn0seyIxODg3OCI6NH1d\">Isaiah 10:24-27; 49:9, 24-25; 63:11-14<\/a>).<\/p>",
