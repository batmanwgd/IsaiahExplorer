The \u201ccauls\u201d were probably wreaths, or plaits of gold or silver net-work, worn over the forehead from ear to ear, but have been taken by some scholars as sun-like balls worn like a necklace.<\/p>\n <p>Round tires like the moon.\u2014The crescent ornaments which were hung on the necks of the camels of the Midianites in the time of Gideon (<a class=\"ref\">Judges 8:21<\/a>), and are still worn by Arabian women. It is not improbable that they were connected with the worship of Ashtaroth. Among modern Arabian women they are regarded as a charm against the evil eye.
