    "html": "<p>Characterizing the Jacob\/Israel category of Jehovah&rsquo;s people is its ambivalence about who to worship, the gods of Babylon or Jehovah. Jacob\/Israel&rsquo;s end-time implication in idolatry thus resembles its idolatry in the past, requiring constant reminders: &ldquo;Choose this day whom you will serve... but as for me and my house we will serve Jehovah&rdquo; (<a class=\"ref\">Joshua 24:15<\/a>); &ldquo;How long will you waver between two opinions? If Jehovah is God, follow him, but if Baal, follow him&rdquo; (<a class=\"ref\">1 Kings 18:21<\/a>). Unlike his aberrant people and their idols, who age with time, Jehovah is ageless, as they too may become (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg0NDkiOjR9XQ==\">Isaiah 40:28-31<\/a>).<\/p><p>Just as his people are burdened by their idols, so Jehovah is burdened by his people: &ldquo;You have burdened me with your sins, wearied me with your iniquities. But it is I myself, and for my own sake, who blot out your offenses, remembering your sins no more&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg1MzAiOjJ9XQ==\">Isaiah 43:24-25<\/a>; cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg1NTYiOjF9XQ==\">44:22<\/a>); &ldquo;For he thought, &lsquo;Surely they are my people, sons who will not play false.&rsquo; And so he became their Savior: with all their troubles he troubled himself, the angel of his presence delivering them. In his love and compassion he himself redeemed them; he lifted them up and carried them all the days of old&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg4NzUiOjJ9XQ==\">Isaiah 63:8-9<\/a>).<\/p>",
