    "html": "<p><a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 52:13&ndash;15<\/a>is a dualistic prophecy. On the one hand, it refers to Jesus Christ. These verses belong with <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 53<\/a>as introductory material for the greatest of the Old Testament messianic chapters. The Savior&rsquo;s &ldquo;visage was so marred more than any man&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTg3MTE=\">Isaiah 52:14<\/a>) when He suffered for the sins of mankind and was crucified on Calvary. Nails&mdash;metal spikes&mdash;were driven into His hands and feet, and a spear pierced His side to ensure His death (see <a class=\"ref\">John 19:17&ndash;18, 32&ndash;34<\/a>).<\/p><p>On the other hand, the Savior Himself made it clear that <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTg3MTA=\">Isaiah 52:13<\/a>also had reference to a servant involved in the &ldquo;great and marvelous work&rdquo; of the Father in the latter days (<a class=\"ref\">3 Nephi 21:9<\/a>). The Book of Mormon verse undoubtedly refers to Joseph Smith and the Restoration. Men &ldquo;marred&rdquo; him, persecuting him throughout his life until they succeeded in killing him. Yet power was given him by the Father &ldquo;to bring forth unto the Gentiles&rdquo; the Book of Mormon as well as other latter-day revelations (see <a class=\"ref\">3 Nephi 21:10&ndash;11<\/a>; see also <a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 3; 10<\/a>). As a result, kings and rulers of the earth behold and consider things &ldquo;which had not been told them&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTg3MTI=\">Isaiah 52:15<\/a>).<\/p><p class=\"cite\">LDS Church Educational System Old Testament Student Manual, 1 Kings&ndash;Malachi, Religion 302, Chapter 17, Item 20<\/p>",
