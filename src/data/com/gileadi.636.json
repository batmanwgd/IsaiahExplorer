    "html": "<p>Jehovah&rsquo;s appointing his servant to restore justice in the earth (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc4MzciOjF9LHsiMTg0ODIiOjR9XQ==\">Isaiah 9:7; 42:1-4<\/a>) has a corollary in his sending him as a paradigm of righteousness that his people may live by that takes into account their current circumstances and the particular challenges they face (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgxNzQiOjh9LHsiMTg3OTMiOjl9XQ==\">Isaiah 28:9-16; 58:6-14<\/a>). Continuing Part VI of Isaiah&rsquo;s Seven-Part Structure&rsquo;s theme of covenantal loyalty, chapter 56 defines righteousness as keeping the terms of Jehovah&rsquo;s covenant (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgxNjkiOjJ9XQ==\">vv 4, 6<\/a>; cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgxMzgiOjN9LHsiMTg1MDIiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 26:7-9; 42:21<\/a>). Because all salvation in the form of covenant blessings stems from covenant keeping, &ldquo;performing righteousness&rdquo; is key.<\/p><p>Jehovah&rsquo;s revealing his <em>righteousness<\/em>&mdash;his servant (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg0NTQiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 41:2<\/a>)&mdash;is a sign that Jehovah&rsquo;s coming as <em>salvation<\/em> is imminent: &ldquo;I have brought near my <em>righteousness<\/em>; it is not now far off&mdash;my <em>salvation<\/em> shall no longer be delayed&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg2MDAiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 46:13<\/a>; emphasis added); &ldquo;Jehovah saw that there was no justice, and it displeased him. When he saw it, he wondered why there was no man, no one who would intervene. So his <em>arm<\/em> brought about <em>salvation<\/em> for him; his <em>righteousness<\/em> rallied to his cause&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg4MTYiOjJ9XQ==\">Isaiah 59:15-16<\/a>; emphasis added). Jehovah&rsquo;s coming as <em>salvation<\/em> transforms the earth forever (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg4NTYiOjR9XQ==\">Isaiah 62:1-2, 11-12<\/a>).<\/p>",
