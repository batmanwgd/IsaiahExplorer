As with Jehovah&rsquo;s grasping him by the hand (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg1MDciOjF9XQ==\">v 1<\/a>), calling him by name signifies royal investiture&mdash;as when an emperor legally adopts a vassal or elevates him to higher status (cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc4MTkiOjF9LHsiMTg0NDciOjF9LHsiMTg0ODciOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 8:11; 40:26; 42:6<\/a>). That appointment is &ldquo;for the sake of&rdquo; Jacob\/Israel in order that Jehovah&rsquo;s people may again become his collective &ldquo;servant&rdquo; or vassal. Jehovah&rsquo;s naming his servant &ldquo;when yet you knew me not&rdquo; signifies his foreordination to his earthly mission (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg2MzgiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 49:1<\/a>).<\/p>",
