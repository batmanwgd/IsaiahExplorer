    "html": "<p><em>The counsel of the wise counselors of Pharaoh is become brutish \"Have counseled a brutish counsel\" -<\/em>The sentence as it now stands in the Hebrew, is imperfect: it wants the verb. Archbishop Secker conjectures that the words <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05e4\u05e8\u05e2\u05d4 \u05d9\u05d5\u05e2\u05e6\u05d9 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">yoatsey pharoh<\/span>  should be transposed; which would in some degree remove the difficulty. But it is to be observed, that the translator of the Vulgate seems to have found in his copy the verb <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d9\u05e2\u05e6\u05d5 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">yaatsu<\/span>  added after <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05e4\u05e8\u05e2\u05d4 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">pharoh<\/span> : <i>Sapientes consiliarii Pharaonis dederunt consilium insipiens<\/i>, \"The wise counsellors of Pharaoh gave unwise counsel.\" This is probably the true reading: it is perfectly agreeable to the Hebrew idiom, makes the construction of the sentence clear, and renders the transposition of the words above mentioned unnecessary. - L.<\/p>",
