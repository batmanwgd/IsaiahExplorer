    "html": "<p>The angels at the time of the Messiah&rsquo;s birth declared &ldquo;peace on earth&rdquo; with His coming (see <a class=\"ref\">Luke 2:14<\/a>). President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., discussed this important title and its meaning:<\/p><p>&ldquo;Heralded centuries before his birth as the &lsquo;Prince of Peace&rsquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc4MzYiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 9:6<\/a>), heavenly angels announced his coming. &hellip;<\/p><p>&ldquo;Modern man sometimes vainly thinks that Jesus&rsquo; mission was to wipe out war; and scoffers have cried that since war still curses the earth, Christ&rsquo;s mission has failed and Christianity is a blight.<\/p><p>&ldquo;Yet Christ himself sent forth his Twelve, saying:<\/p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword.&rsquo; (<a class=\"ref\">Matt. 10:34<\/a>.)<\/p><p>&ldquo;Christ did proclaim a peace&mdash;the peace of everlasting righteousness, which is the eternal and mortal enemy of sin. Between righteousness and sin, in whatever form, there can only be unceasing war, whether in one man, among the people, or between nations in armed conflict. This war is the sword of Christ; whatever its form this war cannot end until sin is crushed and Christ brings all flesh under his dominion. Righteousness is peace wherever it abides; sin in itself is war wherever it is found.&rdquo; (In Conference Report, Apr. 1939, pp. 104&ndash;5).<\/p><p class=\"cite\">LDS Church Educational System Old Testament Student Manual, 1 Kings&ndash;Malachi, Religion 302, Chapter 13, Item 55<\/p>",
