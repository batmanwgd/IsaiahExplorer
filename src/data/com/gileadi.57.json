The antithetical nature of this mini-structure adds perspective to the relationship between good and evil, contrasting the consequences of righteousness and wickedness. Besides synonymously identifying the subject of <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc2NTYiOjMxfV0=\">verse 9<\/a> with &ldquo;the wicked&rdquo; of <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc2NTYiOjMxfV0=\">verse 11<\/a>, it defines &ldquo;disaster&rdquo; and &ldquo;calamity&rdquo; as &ldquo;the fruits of their own labors&rdquo;&mdash;this time of the wicked, not of the righteous. Once the righteous are gathered out from among the wicked, the wicked suffer calamity (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg3NjciOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 57:1<\/a>).<\/p>",
