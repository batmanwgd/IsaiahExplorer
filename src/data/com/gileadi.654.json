He is likewise the <em>trumpet<\/em> that announces Jehovah&rsquo;s coming and the <em>ensign<\/em> that rallies them: &ldquo;All you who live in the world, you inhabitants of the earth, look to the <em>ensign<\/em> when it is lifted up in the mountains; heed the <em>trumpet<\/em> when sounded!&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTgwMDE=\">Isaiah 18:3<\/a>; emphasis added; cf. 62:10-11).<\/p>",
