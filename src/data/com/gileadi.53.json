    "html": "<p>Instead of raising his hand and swearing allegiance to accept his oath of office, the person now raises his hand to disavow it. In fact, by omitting the word &ldquo;hand&rdquo;&mdash;although the verb &ldquo;raise&rdquo; implies it&mdash;Isaiah makes the person&rsquo;s renunciation of his office a parody of his former acceptance of it. That he is no &ldquo;physician&rdquo; or &ldquo;healer&rdquo; (<em>hobes<\/em>) alludes to the pathological state of people who have no access to remedial resources. Such deprivation&mdash;including the lack of food and clothing&mdash;suggests that a prolonged covenant curse has taken effect, rendering the collapsed society incapable of recovery.<\/p>",
