    "html": "<p><em>Fear thou not<\/em>&mdash;This verse is plain in its meaning, and is full of consolation. It is to be regarded as addressed primarily to the exiled Jews during their long and painful captivity in Babylon; and the idea is, that they who had been selected by God to be his special people had nothing to fear. But the promise is one that may be regarded as addressed to all his people in similar circumstances, and it is as true now as it was then, that those whom God has chosen have nothing to fear.<\/p><p><em>For I am with thee<\/em>&mdash;This is a reason why they should not be afraid. God was their protector, and of whom should they be afraid. &lsquo;If God be for us, who can be against us?&rsquo; What higher consolation can man desire than the assurance that he is with him to protect him?<\/p><p><em>Be not dismayed<\/em>&mdash;The word rendered here &lsquo;dismayed&rsquo; (\u05ea\u05e9\u05c1\u05ea\u05e2 t\u0131\u0302shetta\u201b) is derived from \u05e9\u05c1\u05e2\u05d4 sha\u0302\u201ba\u0302h, &ldquo;to see, to look&rdquo;; and then to look about as one does in a state of alarm, or danger. The sense here is, that they should be calm, and under no apprehension from their foes.<\/p><p><em>For I am thy God<\/em>&mdash;I am able to preserve and strengthen thee. The God of heaven was their God; and as he had all power, and that power was pledged for their protection, they had nothing to fear.<\/p><p><em>I will uphold thee<\/em>&mdash;I will enable you to bear all your trials.<\/p><p><em>With the right hand of my righteousness<\/em>&mdash;With my faithful right hand. The phrase is a Hebrew mode of expression, meaning that God&rsquo;s hand was faithful, that it might be relied on, and would secure them.<\/p>",
