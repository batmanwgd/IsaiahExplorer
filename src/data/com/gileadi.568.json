As Jehovah empowers his servant, so the servant empowers them (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg4NDUiOjV9XQ==\">Isaiah 61:1-5<\/a>). Both follow the same pattern of loyalty to Jehovah: &ldquo;Your faithfulness in time [of trial] shall prove to be a strength, your wisdom and knowledge your salvation&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgyODYiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 33:6<\/a>). The &ldquo;favorable time&rdquo; in which Jehovah answers his servant&rsquo;s intercession on behalf of his people under the terms of the Davidic Covenant coincides with the &ldquo;day of salvation&rdquo;&mdash;Jehovah&rsquo;s Day of Judgment that precedes his coming to the earth.<\/p><p>Jehovah&rsquo;s &ldquo;creating&rdquo; or re-creating and &ldquo;appointing&rdquo; his servant as a <em>covenant<\/em> to his people (cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg0ODciOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 42:6<\/a>) denotes his ascent to the seraph level and his role as mediator of Jehovah&rsquo;s covenant.
