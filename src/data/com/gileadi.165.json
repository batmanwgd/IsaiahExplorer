    "html": "<p>Although Jehovah&rsquo;s servant is still the subject of the passage, in the context of Jehovah&rsquo;s millennial reign of peace (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">vv 2-9<\/a>) several candidates exist for those who &ldquo;judge.&rdquo; First is Israel&rsquo;s God: &ldquo;Jehovah is our Judge, and Jehovah our Lawgiver&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTgzMDI=\">Isaiah 33:22<\/a>). Second is Jehovah&rsquo;s servant: &ldquo;In loving kindness shall a throne be set up in the abode of David, and in faithfulness a judge sit on it who will maintain justice and expedite righteousness&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTc5NzU=\">Isaiah 16:5<\/a>). And third are Jehovah&rsquo;s millennial judges: &ldquo;I will restore your judges as at the first, and your counselors as in the beginning&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTc2ODE=\">Isaiah 1:26<\/a>).<\/p><p>Because the servant is a forerunner to Jehovah&rsquo;s coming to reign on the earth, the roles of Jehovah and his servant are closely intertwined. Their judging the nations is therefore likewise intertwined. Isaiah compares them to two <em>arms<\/em>&mdash;<em>righteousness<\/em> and <em>salvation<\/em>&mdash;who judge the peoples: &ldquo;My <em>righteousness<\/em> shall be at hand and my <em>salvation<\/em> proceed; my <em>arms<\/em> shall judge the peoples&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTg2Nzk=\">Isaiah 51:5<\/a>; emphasis added). In short, Jehovah&rsquo;s <em>arm<\/em> of <em>righteousness<\/em>&mdash;his servant (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3sic2luZ2xlcyI6WzE4NDU0XX0seyIxODU5OCI6M31d\">Isaiah 41:2; 46:11-13<\/a>)&mdash;prepares the way before the <em>arm<\/em> of <em>salvation<\/em>, who is Jehovah (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3sic2luZ2xlcyI6WzE4MjgyLDE4NjAwXX0seyIxODQzMSI6Mn0seyIxODg2NSI6Mn1d\">Isaiah 33:2; 40:10-11; 46:13; 62:10-11<\/a>).<\/p><p><em>He will judge.<\/em> Because of many parallel roles of Jehovah and his servant, the subject of the above passage may switch back and forth between the two. On one level, for example, the servant&mdash;unlike the reprobate judges of Jehovah&rsquo;s people&mdash;judges the people &ldquo;with righteousness&rdquo; or &ldquo;righteously&rdquo; (<em>besedeq<\/em>). On another level, Jehovah judges the people &ldquo;with <em>righteousness<\/em>&rdquo; (<em>besedeq<\/em>)&mdash;that is, through his servant who personifies &ldquo;righteousness&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3sic2luZ2xlcyI6WzE4NDU0XX0seyIxODU5OCI6M31d\">Isaiah 41:2; 46:11-13<\/a>). As the servant emulates Jehovah in ministering justice, moreover (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc4MzYiOjJ9LHsiMTg0ODIiOjR9XQ==\">Isaiah 9:6-7; 42:1-4<\/a>), so others who judge emulate the servant.<\/p><p><em>He will smite.<\/em> Multiple applications of the above passage similarly apply to the terms &ldquo;rod,&rdquo; &ldquo;mouth,&rdquo; &ldquo;breath,&rdquo; and &ldquo;lips.&rdquo; On the one hand, Jehovah&rsquo;s servant&mdash;his <em>rod<\/em>, <em>mouth<\/em>, <em>breath<\/em>, and <em>lips<\/em> (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3sic2luZ2xlcyI6WzE4NjE4LDE4NjM5LDE4NjkwXX0seyIxODc4NCI6Mn0seyIxODg1NiI6Mn1d\">Isaiah 48:3; 49:2; 51:16; 57:18-19; 62:1-2<\/a>)&mdash;is its subject. On the other, Jehovah is its subject in the sense that he appoints the servant as his instrument of punishment and deliverance. On a third, possible level, the king of Assyria\/Babylon&mdash;Jehovah&rsquo;s <em>rod<\/em>, <em>mouth<\/em>, <em>breath<\/em>, and <em>lips<\/em> (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3sic2luZ2xlcyI6WzE3ODM0LDE3ODQyLDE3ODU2LDE3ODY2LDE4ODA0XX0seyIxODI0NSI6Mn0seyIxODI5MSI6Mn1d\">Isaiah 9:4, 12; 10:5, 15; 30:27-28; 33:11-12; 59:3<\/a>)&mdash;is its subject when Jehovah appoints him as his instrument of punishment.<\/p><p><em>His intuition will be [guided] by the fear of Jehovah.<\/em> Like Israel&rsquo;s God, his exemplar, Jehovah&rsquo;s servant knows intuitively the justice or injustice of the cases he judges. Imbued with Jehovah&rsquo;s Spirit and the fear of Jehovah (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTc4MzI=\">v 2<\/a>)&mdash;having followed his counsel to &ldquo;sanctify Jehovah of Hosts, making him your fear, him your awe&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTc4MjE=\">Isaiah 8:13<\/a>)&mdash;he is equal to the task. As Moses judged Jehovah&rsquo;s people, but also appointed additional judges to judge them (<a class=\"ref\">Exodus 18:19-26<\/a>), so the servant and other judges arbitrate equitably for the poor and lowly in the land (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3sic2luZ2xlcyI6WzE4MjYxXX0seyIxNzk3NCI6Mn0seyIxODE3MCI6Mn0seyIxODQ4MiI6NH0seyIxODgzOSI6Mn1d\">Isaiah 16:4-5; 28:5-6; 32:1; 42:1-4; 60:17-18<\/a>).<\/p>",
