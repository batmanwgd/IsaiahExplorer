The inference is that it is the God of heaven and earth, no purely human authority, who &ldquo;appoints&rdquo; his servant. In view of the opposition the servant receives from his own people and their leaders (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg2NDQiOjF9LHsiMTg2NzEiOjJ9LHsiMTg3MTEiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 49:7; 50:8-9; 52:14<\/a>), Jehovah anticipates and thus preempts their opposing arguments. Additionally, Jehovah &ldquo;creates&rdquo; or &ldquo;re-creates&rdquo; his servant, implying that the servant experiences rebirth to a higher spiritual category.<\/p><p>Jehovah&rsquo;s &ldquo;rightfully calling&rdquo; his servant and &ldquo;grasping [him] by the hand&rdquo; denote royal accession&mdash;an emperor&rsquo;s investiture of a loyal vassal to royal status, signifying the servant&rsquo;s ascent to a higher spiritual level. Jehovah&rsquo;s appointing his servant as a <em>covenant<\/em> and <em>light<\/em> to the nations implies that he personifies and mediates those things (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg2NDMiOjN9LHsiMTg3NDQiOjN9XQ==\">Isaiah 49:6, 8-9; 55:3-5<\/a>). The servant delivers from spiritual blindness, from physical captivity, and from <em>darkness<\/em>&mdash;the king of Assyria\/Babylon&mdash;those who renew their covenant relationship with Jehovah (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg2NTUiOjR9LHsiMTc4MzIiOjF9LHsiMTg1MTQiOjF9LHsiMTg2NjEiOjJ9LHsiMTg2NzMiOjF9LHsiMTg4MjMiOjR9LHsiMTg4NDUiOjF9XQ==\">vv 18-21; Isaiah 9:2; 43:8; 49:24-25; 50:10; 60:1-4; 61:1<\/a>).<\/p>",
