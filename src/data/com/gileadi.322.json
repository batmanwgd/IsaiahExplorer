The end result is their ruination: &ldquo;Sanctify Jehovah of Hosts, making him your fear, him your awe. And [to you] he will be a sanctuary, but to the two houses of Israel a stumbling block or obstructing rock, and a snare, catching unawares the inhabitants of Jerusalem. Many will stumble into them, and when they fall shall be broken, and when they become ensnared shall be taken captive&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzgyMSI6M30=\">Isaiah 8:13-15<\/a>; cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3sic2luZ2xlcyI6WzE3NzUzXX0seyIxODQ5OSI6OH1d\">5:13; 42:18-25<\/a>).<\/p>",
