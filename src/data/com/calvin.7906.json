    "html": "<p><i>Behold, the hand of Jehovah is not shortened. <\/i>This discourse closely resembles the preceding one; for, after having torn off the mask from hypocrites, who vainly boasted of themselves, and after having shown that the punishment inflicted on them was just, he now replies to other objections. Hypocrites are wont to accuse God either of weakness or of excessive severity. He shows, therefore, that he does not want either power or will to save his people, but that he is prevented by their wickedness from exercising his kindness towards them; and therefore that they do wrong in blaming God, and in uttering those slanders against him, when they ought, on the contrary, to accuse themselves. <\/p>\n<p>The word  <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d4\u05df<\/span> (<i>hen<\/i>) \u201cbehold,\u201d is emphatic, as if the Prophet spoke of something actually present, and pointed it out with the finger, for the sake of expressing certainty, in order to cut off a handle from hypocrites, that they might no longer practice evasion. We must also supply the contrasts to the words \u201cshortened\u201d and \u201cbenumbed;\u201c as if he had said, that formerly there were abundant resources in the hand of God to render assistance to his people, and that he always was ready to be reconciled and lent a willing car to prayers, and that now he is not unlike himself,  as if either his hand were broken or his ears grown dull, so that he did not hear distinctly. <\/p>",
