They worship and serve me, not in such a manner as I have prescribed, but according to men\u2019s inventions, preferring the devices and traditions of their false prophets before my institutions. Or, their religion is merely of human, not of divine, origin: it is the fruit of corrupt nature, and not of renewing grace. <i>I will proceed to do a marvellous work <\/i>\u2014 A thing that will scarce be believed; <i>for the wisdom of their wise men shall perish<\/i> \u2014 Shall disappear and vanish. A veil shall be cast upon the eyes of their minds, and their folly shall be made manifest to all. The most refined arts of their politicians shall not avail their authors, nor be able to preserve them from God\u2019s judgments; and their most wise and learned men shall lose their usual discretion, and be infatuated. This threatening was remarkably fulfilled in the Jews of our Lord\u2019s time, who crucified him out of fear of the Romans, and thereby brought the Romans upon them! And \u201ctheir learned rabbis, ever since, have minded little else but fabulous stories, and the Cabbalists have vented trifles for profound mysteries.\u201d As, in rejecting Christ and his gospel, they removed their hearts far from God, therefore God justly removed wisdom far from them, and hid from their eyes the things that belonged even to their temporal peace.<\/p>",
