It has no force nor emphasis as a repetition; it only embarrasses the construction and the sense. It was not in the copies from which the Septuagint, Syriac, and Vulgate were translated; it was not in the copy of the Septuagint from which the Arabic was translated; but in the Aldine and Complutensian editions <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u03b4\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf<\/span>  is repeated; probably so corrected, in order to make it conformable with the Hebrew text.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>I am he that Moth speak \"I am he, Jehovah, that promised\" -<\/em>For <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d4\u05d5\u05d0 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">hu<\/span>, the Bodleian MS. and another have <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d4 <\/span>, <span class=\"translit\">Jehovah<\/span> ; \"For I am Jehovah that promised;\" and another ancient MS. adds <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d4 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">Jehovah<\/span>  after <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d4\u05d5\u05d0 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">hu<\/span> . The addition of Jehovah seems to be right in consequence of what was said in the preceding line, \"My people shall know my name.\"<\/p>",
