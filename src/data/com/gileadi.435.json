As Jehovah&rsquo;s son and servant&mdash;as his vassal (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc3OTciOjF9LHsiMTgzODgiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 7:14; 37:35<\/a>)&mdash;Hezekiah considers himself answerable for the terms of the Davidic Covenant by &ldquo;walking faithfully&rdquo; and &ldquo;with full purpose of heart&rdquo; before Jehovah&mdash;his emperor&mdash;and in doing &ldquo;good,&rdquo; a term synonymous with covenant keeping.
