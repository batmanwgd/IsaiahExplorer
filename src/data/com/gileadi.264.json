    "html": "<p>The &ldquo;day&rdquo; Jehovah has &ldquo;in store&rdquo; for the fans at entertainments consists of a bizarre version of the performances they used to watch. Reminiscent of devotees&rsquo; lack of restraint at events in the Arena of Spectacles, people abandon self-control in a headlong melee as they attempt to escape the enemy. With invaders breaking through their defenses, the mountains promise the only remaining refuge. Instead of evading capture by the enemy&mdash;by repenting in time and participating in the new exodus to Zion&mdash;they face fear, deprivation, and death: the full measure of covenant curses that is due the wicked.<\/p>",
