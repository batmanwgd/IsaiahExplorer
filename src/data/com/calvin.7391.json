    "html": "<p><i>And my people shall dwell. <\/i>As we have said that spiritual righteousness is that which has its seat in the hearts of men, we must say the same thing about peace, which is the fruit of it. Accordingly, when <i>quiet habitations <\/i>and <i>resting-places <\/i>are here mentioned, let us remember the saying of Paul, \u201cjustified by faith, we have peace with God.\u201d (<a class=\"ref\">Romans 5:1<\/a>.) When Christ says that he \u201cleaves\u201d this peace to the disciples, (<a class=\"ref\">John 14:27<\/a>,) he affirms that \u201cit cannot be given by the world;\u201d and we ought not to wonder at this, for, as the same Apostle Paul informs us in another passage, \u201cthis peace surpasses all understanding.\u201d (<a class=\"ref\">Philippians 4:7<\/a>.) Having obtained this righteousness, we are no longer restless or alarmed within, as when we feel in the gnawings of conscience the wrath of God. A bad conscience is always alarmed, and harassed by wretched uneasiness. <\/p>\n<p>Wicked men must therefore be uneasy, and distressed by a variety of terrors; for where righteousness is banished that peace cannot be found; and where Christ reigns, there alone do we find true peace. Assured peace, therefore, is enjoyed by none but believers, who appeal to the heavenly tribunal, not only by their piety, but by their reliance on the mercy of God. Hence we infer that Christ does not yet reign where consciences are uneasy, and tossed by the various waves of doubts, as must be the case with Papists and all others who are not built on the sacrifice of Christ and the atonement obtained through him. <\/p>",
