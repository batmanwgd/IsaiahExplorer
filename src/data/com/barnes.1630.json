    "html": "<p><em>For I will pour water<\/em>&mdash;Floods, rivers, streams, and waters, are often used in the Scriptures, and especially in Isaiah, to denote plenteous divine blessings, particularly the abundant influences of the Holy Spirit (see the note at <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 35:6-7<\/a> ). That it here refers to the Holy Spirit and his influences, is proved by the parallel expressions in the subsequent part of the verse.<\/p><p><em>Upon him that is thirsty<\/em>&mdash;Or rather, &lsquo;on the thirsty land.&rsquo; The word \u05e6\u05de\u05d0 tsa\u0302me\u0304&rsquo; refers here rather to land, and the figure is taken from a burning sandy desert, where waters would be made to burst out in copious streams (see <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 35:6-7<\/a>). The sense is, that God would bestow blessings upon them as signal and marvelous, as if floods of waters were made to descend on the dry, parched, and desolated earth.<\/p><p><em>And floods<\/em>&mdash;The word \u05e0\u05d5\u05d6\u05dc\u05d9\u05dd no\u0302zel\u0131\u0302ym, from \u05e0\u05d6\u05dc na\u0302zal, &ldquo;to flow,&rdquo; to run as liquids, means properly flowings, and is used for streams and rivers <a class=\"ref\">Exodus 15:8; Psalm 78:16; Proverbs 5:15; Jeremiah 18<\/a>It means here that the spiritual influences which would descend on the afflicted, desolate, comfortless, and exiled people, would be like torrents of rain poured on the thirsty earth. This beautiful figure is common in the Scriptures:<\/p><p>He shall come down like rain upon the grass,<\/p><p>And as showers that water the earth.<\/p>",
