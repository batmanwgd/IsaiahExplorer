The formula with which the section opens reminds us of that of <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTc3NDg=\">Isaiah 5:8<\/a>; <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTc3NTE=\">Isaiah 5:11<\/a>; <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTc3NTg=\">Isaiah 5:18<\/a>; <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTc3NjI=\">Isaiah 5:22<\/a>, and suggests the thought that the prophet is speaking not only or chiefly of the northern kingdom, as in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTc4NTE=\">Isaiah 9:21<\/a>, but of Israel as including Judah. The evils the prophet denounces are, it will be noted, identical with those in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTc2Nzg=\">Isaiah 1:23<\/a>; <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTc3NjM=\">Isaiah 5:23<\/a>. For the second clause of the verse, read, \u201cand the scribes who register oppression.\u201d All the formalities of justice were observed punctiliously. The decision of the unjust judge was duly given and recorded, but the outcome of it all was that the poor, the widow, and the fatherless got no redress. The words for \u201cprey\u201d and \u201crob\u201d are those used in the mysterious name of <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTc4MDk=\">Isaiah 8:1<\/a>. They occur again in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTc4NTc=\">Isaiah 10:6<\/a>. It would seem as if the prophet sought in this way to impress the thought of the great law of divine retribution. Men were reaping as they had sown.<\/p>",
