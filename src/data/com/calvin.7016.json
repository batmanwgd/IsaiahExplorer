There is no reason why men dread the danger or poison arising from the bite of serpents, but because they do not deserve that God should place every part of the world under their control. And, indeed, since animals are permitted to do injury even to <i>children<\/i>, this shows that the whole race of Adam has been stained with pollution from the very womb. <\/p>\n<p>We must again observe the comparison which we stated, that those men whom a concealed poison led to deeds of violence will have their disposition changed, and will do no harm even to <i>little children<\/i>. Some men are openly fierce and cruel, (<a class=\"ref\">Psalms 140:3<\/a>,) and others inwardly carry and cherish their malice like poison, (<a class=\"ref\">Psalms 55:21<\/a>,) as David also describes them; for some men are more quick, and others are more slow, to manifest the desire of doing injury. Whatever they may have formerly been, he means that all of them must be cleansed from wickedness, both open and concealed, after having submitted to Christ. He means, also, that henceforth safety, which will reign everywhere, will be enjoyed even by those who have no kind of protection; so that they will freely venture to expose themselves to imminent dangers. <\/p>",
