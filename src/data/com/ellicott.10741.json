The Syriac version and some modern scholars (e.g., Cheyne) adopt a reading which gives to see my face. In either case the implied thought is that the worshippers believed they came into the more immediate presence of Jehovah when, they entered the Temple courts. To \u201cappear before God\u201d was the normal phrase for visiting the Temple at the three great Feasts and other solemn occasions (<a class=\"ref\">Exodus 34:23; Psalms 42:3; Psalms 84:7<\/a>).<\/p>",
