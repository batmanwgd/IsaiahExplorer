Instead, by blatantly pursuing hedonistic pleasures, Jehovah&rsquo;s apostate people repudiate all decency and their covenantal obligation to defend themselves. Instead of appealing to Jehovah for help and preparing to engage the enemy, they throw parties. Tantamount to murder, their crime deserves the death penalty from &ldquo;Jehovah of Hosts&rdquo;&mdash;Israel&rsquo;s God in his executive role.<\/p>",
