Those who translate it <i>girdle<\/i>, suppose the meaning to be that Tyre will be so completely plundered, that she will not even have a <i>girdle <\/i>left; and that the allusion is to the vast wealth laid out in merchandise, for the poorest of the merchants sell girdles. But I think that Isaiah alludes to the situation of the city, which was protected on all sides by ditches, mounds, ramparts, and the sea. <\/p>",
