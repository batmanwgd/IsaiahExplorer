    "html": "<p><em>The Lord will visit Tyre<\/em>&mdash;He will restore her to her former wealth and magnificence.<\/p><p><em>And she shall turn to her hire<\/em>&mdash;The word &lsquo;hire&rsquo; here denotes the wages or reward that is given to an harlot; and the idea which was commenced in the previous verses is here continued&mdash;of Tyre as an harlot&mdash;frivolous, splendid, licentious, and holding intercourse with strangers and foreigners. The gains of that commerce with other nations are here represented as her hire.<\/p><p><em>And shall commit fornication...<\/em>&mdash;Shall again be the mart of commerce <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgwODEiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 23:3<\/a>; shall have contact with all the nations, and derive her support, splendor, luxury, from all. The idea is, that she would be restored to her former commercial importance, and perhaps, also, the prophet intends to intimate that she would procure those gains by dishonest acts, and by fraudulent pretexts. After the destruction of Tyre by Nebuchadnezzar, it remained desolate until the close of the Babyloian monarchy. Then a new city was built on the island, that soon rivaled the former in magnificence. That new city was besieged and taken by Alexander the Great, on his way to the conquests of the East.<\/p>",
