    "html": "<p>King Ahaz was reluctant to accept counsel, so the prophet challenged him to seek the confirming witness of the Lord: &ldquo;ask a sign&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc3OTQiOjF9XQ==\">v. 11<\/a>). Still the king refused, not because he was unwilling to tempt God as he said (v. 12), but because he did not want the Lord interfering in his plans to make an alliance with other nations. But the Lord revealed the sign anyway, confirming the prophetic promise that the Messiah would be born of the remnant of Judah and that Judah would not totally perish. In contrast to the promise to Judah, the writer prophesied the fall of the Northern Kingdom, &ldquo;the land thou abhorrest&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc3OTkiOjF9XQ==\">v. 16<\/a>), which opposed King Ahaz. The two kings who reigned in the north at that time were put to death by the Assyrians. (See Monte S.
