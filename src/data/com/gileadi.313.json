Hurtful conditions such as the land&rsquo;s takeover by animals and desiccation of its foliage are seldom perceived as Jehovah&rsquo;s covenant curses by the wicked, who are interested only in filling their immediate needs. Because by their idolatry they have become &ldquo;an undiscerning people,&rdquo; they come under Jehovah&rsquo;s law of justice, not of mercy (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3sic2luZ2xlcyI6WzE3NjU4LDE4NzY0XX0seyIxODQ5OCI6OX1d\">Isaiah 1:3; 42:17-25; 56:10<\/a>).<\/p>",
