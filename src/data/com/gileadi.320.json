Ephraim&rsquo;s mode of learning is still &ldquo;line upon line, line upon line,<em><\/em> precept upon precept, precept upon precept, here a little, there a little&rdquo; (<em>saw lasaw saw lasaw qaw laqaw qaw laqaw ze&lsquo;ir sam ze&lsquo;ir sam<\/em>). Assonance and alliteration parody their rote method of learning that consists of parroting back what their leaders teach.<\/p>",
