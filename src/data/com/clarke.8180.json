He is represented under the glorious figure of the sun, or light, rising on a benighted world, and diffusing joy and gladness wherever he sheds his beams,  <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 9:1-3<\/a>. His conquests are astonishing and miraculous, as in the day of Midian; and the peace which they procure is to be permanent, as denoted by the burning of all the implements of war,  <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTc4MzQ=\">Isaiah 9:4<\/a>,  <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTc4MzU=\">Isaiah 9:5<\/a>. The person and character of this great Deliverer are then set forth in the most magnificent terms which the language of mankind could furnish,  <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTc4MzY=\">Isaiah 9:6<\/a>. The extent of his kingdom is declared to be universal, and the duration of it eternal,  <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTc4Mzc=\">Isaiah 9:7<\/a>.
