    "html": "<p>Keeping Jehovah&rsquo;s commandments&mdash;the law of his covenant&mdash;defines righteousness by Jehovah&rsquo;s standard (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg1MDIiOjF9LHsiMTg2NzgiOjN9XQ==\">Isaiah 42:21; 51:4-5, 7<\/a>) and begets peace (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgxMzMiOjJ9LHsiMTg3NjgiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 26:2-3; 57:2<\/a>). Righteousness, moreover&mdash;as a spiritual attribute and as Jehovah&rsquo;s servant personifies it (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgxMzgiOjR9LHsiMTg0NTQiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 26:7-10; 41:2<\/a>)&mdash;begets salvation (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg1OTkiOjJ9LHsiMTg3NTUiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 46:12-13; 56:1<\/a>), which is itself synonymous with peace (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgxMzIiOjJ9LHsiMTg3MDQiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 26:1, 3; 52:7<\/a>). Peace, in turn, implies an absence of the power of chaos <em>Sea<\/em> and <em>River<\/em>, which the archtyrant personifies (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc3NzAiOjF9LHsiMTc4MTUiOjJ9XQ==\">Isaiah 5:30; 8:7-8<\/a>) but which Jehovah subdues when his people keep the terms of his covenant (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg4MjciOjF9LHsiMTg5MzUiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 60:5; 66:12<\/a>).<\/p><p>As Abraham exemplified righteousness (<a class=\"ref\">Genesis 15:6<\/a>), and as Jehovah promised him offspring as many as the sands of the sea (<a class=\"ref\">Genesis 22:17<\/a>), so he promises the same to those whose righteousness compares with Abraham&rsquo;s. The alternative to covenant blessings, however, are covenant curses. Instead of receiving &ldquo;an everlasting name that shall not be cut off&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg3NTkiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 56:5<\/a>; cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg4NTciOjF9LHsiMTg5NDUiOjF9XQ==\">62:2; 66:22<\/a>), the names of Jehovah&rsquo;s unrepentant people and their offspring <em>are<\/em> &ldquo;cut off&rdquo;&mdash;that is, excluded from his covenant people and included in the Greater Babylon category that is damned (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc5NTEiOjF9LHsiMTg4ODYiOjF9LHsiMTg5MTMiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 14:22; 63:19; 65:15<\/a>).<\/p>",
