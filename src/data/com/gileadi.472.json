What legitimizes a prophet in Jehovah&rsquo;s eyes is that he predicts things that come to pass: &ldquo;If there is a prophet among you, I Jehovah will make myself known to him in a vision and speak to him in a dream&rdquo; (<a class=\"ref\">Numbers 12:6<\/a>); &ldquo;When a prophet speaks in the name of Jehovah, if the thing doesn&rsquo;t follow or come to pass Jehovah hasn&rsquo;t said it, but the prophet has said it presumptuously. You shall not be afraid of him&rdquo; (<a class=\"ref\">Deuteronomy 18:22<\/a>).<\/p><p>Unlike the ecclesiastical leaders who profess to be prophets but aren&rsquo;t, whom Jehovah now puts on trial, his servant predicts things that come to pass: &ldquo;All of you, assemble and hear: Who among you foretold these things? It is him Jehovah loves, who shall perform his will in Babylon; his arm shall be against the Chaldeans. I myself have spoken it, and also called him; I have brought him, and I will prosper his way. Come near me and hear this: I have not made predictions in secret; at their coming to pass, I have been present. Now my Lord Jehovah has sent me; his Spirit [is in me]&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 48:14-16<\/a>).<\/p>",
