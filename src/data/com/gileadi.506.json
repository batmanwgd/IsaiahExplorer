    "html": "<p>The alternating chaos\/creation pattern in these chapters illustrates the ambivalence of the Jacob\/Israel category of Jehovah&rsquo;s people. Faced with two choices&mdash;one leading to rebirth, re-creation, and deliverance; the other to ruin, de-creation, and destruction&mdash;this spiritual category lacks the vision to see, hear, and understand fully what is at stake. Jehovah appeals to them that he&mdash;their Maker, who &ldquo;formed&rdquo; or created them initially&mdash;has chosen them to be his collective servant or vassal. Their proving loyal and living up to the name Jeshurun or &ldquo;Upright One&rdquo; will dispel their fears of the unknown.<\/p>",
