Under these two instances he understands all those, who, either by birth, or by any ceremonial pollution, were excluded from church privileges, and so he throws open the door to all true believers. <i>Behold, I am a dry tree <\/i>\u2014 A fruitless tree, accursed by God with the curse of barrenness. <i>For thus saith the Lord unto the eunuchs, <\/i>&c. \u2014 That observe my commands, not by custom, or through force or fear, but by free choice, with love to them, and delight in them. <i>And take hold of my covenant <\/i>\u2014 That steadfastly keep the conditions of my covenant. <i>Even unto them will I give in my house, <\/i>&c. \u2014 In my temple, an emblem of the Christian church; <i>a place, &c., better than of sons and daughters <\/i>\u2014 A far greater blessing and honour than that of having a posterity, even my favour, and my Spirit and eternal felicity.<\/p>",
