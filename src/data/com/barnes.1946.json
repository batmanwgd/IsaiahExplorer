For this use of the word &lsquo;known,&rsquo; see <a class=\"ref\">Psalm 67:2; Psalm 76:1; Psalm 79:10<\/a>.<\/p><p><em>And their offspring<\/em>&mdash;(See the notes at <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg2MzQiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 48:19<\/a>). The Chaldee and the Syriac render this, &lsquo;Their children&rsquo;s children.&rsquo; The sense is, that the true friends of the church shall be everywhere honored. Distant lands shall be acquainted with them, and shall be disposed to show them distinguished respect.<\/p><p><em>Among the people<\/em>&mdash;The people of distant lands.<\/p><p><em>All that see them shall acknowledge them<\/em>&mdash;The time shall come when the true friends of the Redeemer will be universally honored. They shall be regarded as the favored of the Lord; and instead of being persecuted and despised, the nations of the earth will regard them as worthy of their confidence and esteem.<\/p>",
