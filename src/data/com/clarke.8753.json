    "html": "<p>The prophet exhorts the children of Abraham to trust in the Lord; and briefly, but beautifully, describes the great blessedness which should be the consequence,  <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODY3NSI6M30=\">Isaiah 51:1-3<\/a>. Then, turning to the Gentiles, encourages them to look for a portion in the same salvation,  <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTg2Nzg=\">Isaiah 51:4<\/a>,  <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTg2Nzk=\">Isaiah 51:5<\/a>; the everlasting duration of which is majestically described,  <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTg2ODA=\">Isaiah 51:6<\/a>. And as it is everlasting, so is it sure to the righteous, notwithstanding all the machinations of their enemies,  <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTg2ODE=\">Isaiah 51:7<\/a>,  <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTg2ODI=\">Isaiah 51:8<\/a>. The faithful, then, with exultation and joy, lift their voices, reminding God of his wondrous works of old, which encourage them to look now for the like glorious accomplishment of these promises,  <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODY4MyI6M30=\">Isaiah 51:9-11<\/a>. In answer to this the Divinity is introduced comforting them under their trials, and telling them that the deliverer was already on his way to save and to establish them,  <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODY4NiI6NX0=\">Isaiah 51:12-16<\/a>. On this the prophet turns to Jerusalem to comfort and congratulate her on so joyful a prospect. She is represented, by a bold image, as a person lying in the streets, under the intoxicating effects of the cup of the Divine wrath, without a single person from among her own people appointed to give her consolation, and trodden under the feet of her enemies; but, in the time allotted by the Divine providence, the cup of trembling shall be taken out of her hand, and put into that of her oppressors; and she shall drink it no more again for ever,  <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODY5MSI6Nn0=\">Isaiah 51:17-22<\/a>.<\/p>",
