If this be the true meaning of the word, then <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05e9\u05d0\u05dc\u05d5 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">shaalu<\/span>, \"that asked,\" which follows, should seem defective, the verb wanting its object: but two MSS., one of them ancient, have <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05e9\u05d0\u05dc\u05d5\u05e0\u05d9 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">shealuni<\/span>, \"asked me;\" and another MS. <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05dc\u05d9 \u05e9\u05d0\u05dc\u05d5 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">shealu li<\/span>, \"asked for me;\" one or other of which seems to be right. But Cocceius in Lex., and Vitringa in his translation, render <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05e0\u05d3\u05e8\u05e9\u05ea\u05d9 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">nidrashti<\/span>, by \"I have answered;\" and so the verb is rendered by all the ancient Versions in  <a class=\"ref\">Ezekiel 20:3,  Ezekiel 20:31<\/a>. If this be right, the translation will be, \"I have answered those that asked not.\" I leave this to the reader's judgment; but have followed in my translation the Septuagint and St. Paul, and the MSS. above mentioned. <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d1\u05e7\u05e9\u05e0\u05d9 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">bikeshuni<\/span>  is written regularly and fully in above a hundred MSS. and in the oldest edition, <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d1\u05e7\u05e9\u05d5\u05e0\u05d9 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">bikeshuni<\/span> . - L.<\/p>",
