As they sow the rice on the water, they transplant it in the water. \"Harmer's Observ. vol. 1 p. 280. \"Rice is the food of two-thirds of mankind.\" Dr. Arbuthnot. \"It is cultivated in most of the eastern countries.\" Miller. \"It is good for all, and at all times.\" Sir J. Chardin, ib. \"<i>Le ris, qui est leur principal aliment et leur froment (i.e., des Siamois), n'est jamais assez arrose; il croit au milieu de l'eau, et les campagnes ou on le cultive ressemblent plutot a de marets que non pas a des terres qu'on laboure aver la charue. Le ris a bien cette force, que quoy qu'il y ait six ou sept pieds d'eau sur lui, il pousse toujours sa tige au dessus; et le tuyau qui le porte s'eleve et croit a proportion de la hauteur de l'eau qui noye son champ<\/i>. Voyage de l'Eveque de Beryte, p. 144. Paris, 1666. - L. \"Rice, which is the principal grain and aliment of the Siamese, can never be too much watered. It grows in the water, and the fields where it is sown resemble marshes rather than fields cultivated by ploughing. Rice has that property that although it be covered with water six or seven feet deep, yet it raises its stalk above it; and this grows long in proportion to the depth of the water by which the field is inundated.\"<\/p>",
