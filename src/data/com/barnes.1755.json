    "html": "<p><em>But thus saith the Lord<\/em>&mdash;The meaning of this verse is, that however difficult or impracticable this might seem to be, yet it should be done. The captives taken by the terrible and the mighty should be rescued, and should be restored to their own land.<\/p><p><em>Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away<\/em>&mdash;Margin, as Hebrew, &lsquo;The captivity of the mighty.&rsquo; That which could not have been rescued by any ordinary means. The language here refers undoubtedly to Babylon, and to the captivity of the Jews there.<\/p><p><em>The prey of the terrible<\/em>&mdash;Of a nation formidable, cruel, and not inclined to compassion; in the previous verse described as &lsquo;just,&rsquo; that is, indisposed to mercy.<\/p><p><em>For I will contend with him<\/em>&mdash;I will punish the nation that has inflicted these wrongs on thee, and will thus rescue thee from bondage.<\/p>",
