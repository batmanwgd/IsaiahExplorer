But in the end, when she is gathered once again, there will be more children from the &ldquo;desolate,&rdquo; or temporarily forsaken, wife than when she enjoyed her wedded status in ancient times (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTg3MjU=\">Isaiah 54:1<\/a>). This being true, space must be found so that the latter-day &ldquo;tent&rdquo; of Zion can be expanded to accommodate them all. When one wishes to make a small tent larger, one must pull up the stakes and move to a further distance from the center pole. This is what is meant by lengthening the cords and strengthening the stakes (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTg3MjY=\">v. 2<\/a>; see also Notes and Commentary on Isaiah 33:20&ndash;24). Israel&rsquo;s latter-day growth through conversion and gathering is represented as breaking &ldquo;forth on the right hand and on the left&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTg3Mjc=\">Isaiah 54:3<\/a>).<\/p><p>In ancient times, the inability to bear children was considered a great curse by women of the Middle East. As a gathered &ldquo;wife,&rdquo; Israel will forget the shame or cast-off status of her earlier years and rejoice in her new and prosperous condition. She is once again &ldquo;married&rdquo; to the Lord (see <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">vv. 4&ndash;5<\/a>). The barren or forsaken years, though they seemed long, were but a small moment compared to the vast eternity that lies ahead (see <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">vv. 6&ndash;8<\/a>).<\/p><p class=\"cite\">LDS Church Educational System Old Testament Student Manual, 1 Kings&ndash;Malachi, Religion 302, Chapter 17, Item 28<\/p>",
