    "html": "<p>The appearance of Zion&rsquo;s &ldquo;watchmen&rdquo; after the appearance of Jehovah&rsquo;s servant in the Book of Isaiah implies that he occasions their emergence and ministry. Those who &ldquo;follow&rdquo; and &ldquo;know&rdquo; <em>righteousness<\/em> (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4Njc1LDE4NjgxXQ==\">Isaiah 51:1, 7<\/a>)&mdash;Jehovah&rsquo;s servant&mdash;in other words, ultimately ascend spiritually and assume restorative functions toward Jehovah&rsquo;s people as the servant does: &ldquo;I have appointed watchmen on your walls, O Jerusalem, who shall not be silent day or night. You who call upon Jehovah, let not up nor give him respite till he reestablishes Jerusalem and makes it renowned in the earth&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 62:6-7<\/a>).<\/p><p>Those whom Jehovah&rsquo;s servant endows in the holy priesthood are thus called &ldquo;oaks of <em>righteousness<\/em>&rdquo; and &ldquo;priests of Jehovah&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODQ3LDE4ODUwXQ==\">Isaiah 61:3, 6<\/a>). These righteous watchmen &ldquo;lift up their voice,&rdquo; signifying (1) that they herald Jehovah&rsquo;s coming as the servant does; and (2) that they sustain the servant&mdash;Jehovah&rsquo;s <em>voice<\/em> to his people (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDI0LDE4NjczXQ==\">Isaiah 40:3; 50:10<\/a>). Unlike Jehovah&rsquo;s blind and unwary watchmen whom they replace&mdash;the &ldquo;dumb watchdogs&rdquo; and &ldquo;lolling seers&rdquo; who come under condemnation (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 56:10-12<\/a>)&mdash;Zion&rsquo;s watchmen &ldquo;see eye to eye,&rdquo; having seen the same vision of the end from the beginning.<\/p>",
