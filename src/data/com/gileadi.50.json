    "html": "<p>Although God gave humanity the freedom to choose good or evil in the Garden of Eden (<a class=\"ref\">Genesis 2:16-17<\/a>), once a person chooses he isn&rsquo;t free to decide the consequences. Likewise, when Jehovah&rsquo;s people choose evil, evil aftereffects unavoidably follow. So it is with their leadership. As the people do, so do their leaders; and vice versa. Spiritually immature and profligate persons&mdash;&ldquo;adolescents&rdquo; and &ldquo;delinquents&rdquo;&mdash;end up governing their affairs, bringing the nation to ruin. Relying on their own wisdom instead of on Jehovah&rsquo;s, their darkened minds can&rsquo;t foresee the end result of their nefarious handiwork.<\/p>",
