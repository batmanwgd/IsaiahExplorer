Divine comfort thus follows after trials that test a person&rsquo;s loyalties when one keeps the terms of Jehovah&rsquo;s covenant (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg0MjIiOjJ9LHsiMTg2NTAiOjR9LHsiMTg5MjgiOjl9XQ==\">Isaiah 40:1-2; 49:13-16; 66:5-13<\/a>). Many such trials come at the hands of &ldquo;mortal man&rdquo; or &ldquo;the children of men,&rdquo; tempting Jehovah&rsquo;s people to fear their enemies. But Jehovah reminds his people that before long their oppressors will perish when he turns them into grass&mdash;a chaos motif (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgzODAiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 37:27<\/a>).<\/p>",
