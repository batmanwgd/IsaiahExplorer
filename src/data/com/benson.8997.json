They cannot blame God, but themselves: their destruction is wholly from themselves. The word  <span class=\"hebrew_text\">\u05d4\u05db\u05e8\u05d4<\/span>, rendered <i>show, <\/i>in the first clause of the verse, not occurring elsewhere in the Bible, is of rather uncertain signification. Bishop Lowth renders it, <i>steadfastness; <\/i>and Dr. Waterland, <i>impudence. <\/i>The former translates the whole verse thus: \u201cThe steadfastness of their countenance witnesseth against them: for their sin, like Sodom, they publish, they hide it not: wo to their souls! for upon themselves have they brought down evil.\u201d<\/p>",
