These terms associate the reprobate of Jehovah&rsquo;s people with Isaiah&rsquo;s Babylon category, as it is they who stumble and fall, not Zion (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3OTIyLDE3OTI2LDE3OTMzLDE3OTQxLDE4MDQ1XQ==\">Isaiah 13:15, 19; 14:4, 12; 21:9<\/a>). Isaiah&rsquo;s paralleling his people&rsquo;s &ldquo;tongue&rdquo; and &ldquo;actions&rdquo; shows their interrelationship: when one is evil, so is the other. The word <em>tongue<\/em> additionally serves as a pseudonym of the king of Assyria\/Babylon, whom the wicked emulate in speaking evil before God (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3sic2luZ2xlcyI6WzE3ODQ3LDE4Mzc2LDE4NzcwLDE4ODA0XX0seyIxODI2NiI6Mn1d\">Isaiah 9:17; 32:6-7; 37:23; 57:4; 59:3<\/a>).<\/p>",
