    "html": "<p><em>In that day shall the nail<\/em>&mdash;Not Eliakim, but Shebna. Eliakim was to be fastened, that is, confirmed in office. But Shebna was to be removed.<\/p><p><em>That is fastened in the sure place<\/em>&mdash;Or, that was once fastened, or was supposed to be fastened&mdash;a phrase appropriate to an office which the incumbent supposed to be firm or secure. It here refers to Shebna. He was regarded as haying a permanent hold on the office, and was making provisions for ending his days in it.<\/p><p><em>Be removed<\/em>&mdash;To a distant land <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgwNzAiOjJ9XQ==\">Isaiah 22:17-18<\/a>, or simply taken down.<\/p><p><em>And be cut down, and fall<\/em>&mdash;As a spike, pin, or peg would be taken away from the wall of a house.<\/p><p><em>And the burden that was upon it<\/em>&mdash;All that it sustained&mdash;as the spikes in the wall of a house sustained the cups of gold, the raiment, or the armor that belonged to the family. Here it means, all that was dependent on Shebna&mdash;the honor of his family, his emoluments, his hope of future fame, or of an honored burial. All these would fail as a matter of course, when he was removed from his office. This is one instance of the usual mode of the divine administration. The errors of a man entrusted with office entail poverty, disgrace, and misery on all who are connected with him. Not only is his own name disgraced, but his sin &ldquo;diffuses itself,&rdquo; as it were, on all connected wit him. It involves them in want, and shame, and tears; and the design is to deter those in office from sin, by the fact that their crimes and errors &ldquo;will&rdquo; thus involve the innocent in calamiry, and shed disgrace and woe on those whom they love.<\/p>",
