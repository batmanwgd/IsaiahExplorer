    "html": "<p>As his physical and mental torment progresses, Hezekiah realizes its purifying and sanctifying effect&mdash;that even his suffering and dying can have meaning. As he can&rsquo;t gainsay Jehovah and wish his pain away, he submits to it and in so doing regenerates spiritually. Sensing the remission of sins that comes with making his life an offering to God, he perceives Jehovah&rsquo;s comforting him with a sure knowledge of his forgiveness in his hour of anguish. He now sees things from God&rsquo;s perspective, not only his own. Having passed his test, the deliverer is born&mdash;Jehovah can now save him and his people (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg3MTgiOjF9XQ==\">v 6<\/a>).<\/p>",
