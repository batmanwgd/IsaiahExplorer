    "html": "<p>The lives of Jehovah&rsquo;s righteous people are oriented around Jehovah and the terms of his covenants. The personal pronouns &ldquo;me&rdquo; and &ldquo;my&rdquo; show that it is a person&rsquo;s individual choice, not a collective psyche, that leads into Jehovah&rsquo;s presence&mdash;that righteousness is learned through one&rsquo;s own volition. Jehovah&rsquo;s ordinances serve as a channel to that soul or spirit who yearns for him and seeks after him night and day. Jehovah&rsquo;s raising up his end-time servant&mdash;his <em>righteousness<\/em>&mdash;accelerates his people&rsquo;s preparation throughout the earth for Jehovah&rsquo;s anticipated coming (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg1OTgiOjN9LHsiMTg2NzUiOjZ9LHsiMTg3NTUiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 46:11-13; 51:1, 4-8; 56:1<\/a>).<\/p>",
