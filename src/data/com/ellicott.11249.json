There seems no reason, however, why the prophet should not have prefixed it as with the sarcasm of an indignant irony. \u201cYou ask for an oracle,\u201d he seems to say, and you shall have one; but its very heading will imply condemnation and derision; \u201cand then he continues his picture of the journey of the embassy. They pass through the Negeb, the south country, arid and waste, haunted only by lions, and vipers, and fiery (i.e., venomous) serpents, and they had their asses and camels with them, laden with the treasures with which they hoped to purchase the Egyptian alliance.<\/p>",
