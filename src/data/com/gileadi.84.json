For that purpose, he sends <em>righteousness<\/em> the person&mdash;his end-time servant (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg0NTQiOjR9LHsiMTg0ODIiOjR9LHsiMTg1OTgiOjN9XQ==\">Isaiah 41:2, 25-27; 42:1-4; 46:11-13<\/a>). Only when his alienated people reject his servant (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg2NDQiOjF9LHsiMTg2NjciOjh9XQ==\">Isaiah 49:7; 50:4-11<\/a>) does Jehovah&rsquo;s holiness compel him to execute a &ldquo;just judgment&rdquo; and punish them. At the same time, those whose thoughts are pure, whose eyes are downcast because of the depravity of the wicked, he liberates from the vile who oppress them. In so doing Jehovah is &ldquo;exalted.&rdquo;<\/p>",
