    "html": "<p>Hezekiah&rsquo;s recovery from a deathly illness was a wonderful portent for his people and it brought the king fame throughout the known world. It accorded with the ancient Near Eastern concept of the arrested sacrifice of the king&mdash;in which a king or his proxy was symbolically slain to appease his god and to generate blessings on behalf of his people. Still, Hezekiah appears to have yielded to a little foolish pride by gladly accepting gifts from foreigners and making them privy to his inner sanctum. Although the king was justly elated that he had passed Jehovah&rsquo;s test of his loyalty, he still had things to learn.<\/p>",
