    "html": "<p><a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTc2NTg=\">Isaiah 1:3<\/a>.<i>The ox knoweth his owner, <\/i>&c. \u2014 In these words the prophet amplifies \u201cthe gross insensibility of the disobedient Jews, by comparing them with the most heavy and stupid of all animals, yet not so insensible as they. Bochart has well illustrated the comparison, and shown the peculiar force of it. \u2018He sets them lower than the beasts, and even than the stupidest of all beasts; for there is scarce any more so than the ox and the ass. Yet these acknowledge their master; they know the manger of their lord; by whom they are fed, not for their own, but his good; neither are they looked upon as children, but as beasts of burden; neither are they advanced to honours, but oppressed with great and daily labours. While the Israelites, chosen by the mere favour of God, adopted as sons, promoted to the highest dignity, yet acknowledged not their Lord and their God, but despised his commandments, though in the highest degree equitable and just.\u2019\u201d See a comparison of <a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 8:7<\/a>, to the same purpose, equally elegant; but not so forcible and severe as this of Isaiah.<\/p>",
