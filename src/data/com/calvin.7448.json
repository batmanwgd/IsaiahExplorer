    "html": "<p><i>I have said (only a word of the lips.) <\/i>In the sacred history (<a class=\"ref\">2 Kings 18:20<\/a>) the word employed is, <i>Thou hast said <\/i>This may be explained as a declaration what kind of courage Rabshakeh thinks that Hezekiah possesses; as if he had said, \u201cSuch are thy deliberations.\u201d In this passage the use of the first person, \u201cI have said,\u201d does not alter the sense; because Rabshakeh, as if he had examined the counsels of Hezekiah and fully understood them all, ironically reproaches him; \u201cI see what thou art thinking, but they are <i>words of the lips.\u201d <\/i>This passage is explained in various ways. Some interpret it, \u201cThou sayest, that thou hast not merely words of the lips,\u201d that is, \u201cThou boastest that thou excellest not only in the use of words, but likewise in courage and wisdom.\u201d Others interpret it, \u201cThou hast words indeed, but wisdom and courage are necessary in war.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>Some think that by \u201cwords\u201d are meant \u201cprayers.\u201d I do not approve of that exposition; for it is excessively farfetched and unnatural, and therefore I view it thus: \u201cHezekiah has words of lips, that is, he employs a beautiful and elegant style, to keep the people in the discharge of their duty, or, as we commonly say, <i>He has fine speeches; <\/i> but it is not by these that war can be begun or carried on.\u201d He therefore means, that he perfectly understands what Hezekiah is doing, and what it is on which he places his chief reliance, namely, on words and eloquence;  but these are of no use for war, in which wisdom and courage are needed. It might also be appropriately viewed as relating to the Egyptians, as if he had said that Hezekiah acts foolishly in allowing himself to be cheated by empty promises; and undoubtedly the Egyptians were liberal in promising mountains of gold, though they gave nothing in reality. But as we shall find that he speaks of the Egyptians, soon afterwards, in a particular manner, I have no doubt that here he ridicules Hezekiah, as if he fed the expectation of the people by empty boasting, while he was not provided with military preparations. <\/p>",
