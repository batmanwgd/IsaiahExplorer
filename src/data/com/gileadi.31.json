    "html": "<p>Beyond chapter 1&mdash;the preface of his book&mdash;Isaiah again represents the chapters that follow as a single &ldquo;prophecy&rdquo; or &ldquo;word&rdquo; (<em>dabar<\/em>), not simply as revelations strung together that are unrelated to each other. The full meaning of the Hebrew verb <em>haza<\/em>, for which the English language has no equivalent, is to &ldquo;see in vision.&rdquo; The passage in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTgzNTc=\">verses 2-4<\/a> that follows chapter 2&rsquo;s introductory verse appears also in the Book of Micah (<a class=\"ref\">Micah 4:1-3<\/a>), Isaiah&rsquo;s disciple and friend. In an end-time context, the names &ldquo;Judea&rdquo; and &ldquo;Jerusalem&rdquo; function as codenames of Jehovah&rsquo;s people who live in that day (cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTc2NTY=\">Isaiah 1:1<\/a>).<\/p>",
