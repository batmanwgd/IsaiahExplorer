    "html": "<p><em>Thou shalt also be a crown of glory<\/em>&mdash;On the application of the word &lsquo;crown&rsquo; to a place, see the notes at <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgxNjYiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 28:1<\/a> , where it is applied to Samaria. Some difficulty has been felt by expositors in explaining this, from the fact that a crown or diadem was worn on the head and not held in the hand, and some have supposed that the word &lsquo;crown&rsquo; here is equivalent to any ornament which might be either horne in the hand or worn on the head; others have supposed that the reference is to the custom of carrying a chaplet or garland in the hand on festival occasions. But probably the sense is this, &lsquo;Thou shalt I be so beautiful and prosperous as to be appropriately regarded as a splendid crown or diadem. God shall keep thee as a beautiful diadem&mdash;the crown of beauty among the cities of the earth, and as that which is most comely and valuable in his sight.&rsquo; This is the sense expressed by Gataker and Rosenmuller.<\/p><p><em>And a royal diadem<\/em>&mdash;Hebrew, &lsquo;A diadem of a kingdom.&rsquo; The diadem is the wreath or chaplet, usually set with diamonds, which is &ldquo;encircled&rdquo; (\u05e6\u05e0\u05d9\u05e3 tsa\u0302n\u0131\u0302yph from \u05e6\u05e0\u05e3 tsa\u0302naph) to roll or wind around, to encircle) around the head. It here means such as was usually worn by monarchs; and the sense is, that Jerusalem would become exceedingly beautiful in the sight of God.<\/p>",
