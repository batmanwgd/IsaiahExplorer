It is that his people measure their righteousness before God in terms of their attendance at them, not by their personal integrity. Word links show what kinds of things burden and weary Jehovah, but also that by repenting of evil his people may become clean: &ldquo;You have burdened me with your sins, wearied me with your iniquities. But it is I myself, and for my own sake, who blot out your offenses, remembering your sins no more&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg1MzAiOjJ9XQ==\">Isaiah 43:24-25<\/a>).<\/p>",
