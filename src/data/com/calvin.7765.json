    "html": "<p><i>Shall the prey be taken from the mighty? <\/i>Having solved, in the former verse, an objection which might occur to the mind of believers, he now confirms that solution still more; for it might have been thought incredible that the Jews should be rescued out of the hands of so powerful an enemy, by whom they had been taken in fair battle and reduced to slavery, He therefore adds this question as uttered by the whole of the common people, among whom it probably flew universally from mouth to mouth; and he immediately replies, as we shall sec. <\/p>\n<p><i>Shall the captivity of the righteous <\/i>(or,<i>the righteous captivity<\/i>) <i>be delivered? <\/i>And we ought, first, to observe this metaphor, that the Church is called \u201cthe prey of the mighty\u201d and \u201cthe captivity of the righteous,\u201d that is, lawful captivity. He is said to be the \u201crighteous\u201d possessor who is the lawful possessor; just as the prey, when the war has been righteous, passes into the hands of a righteous possessor.  Such was the condition of the ancient people, after having been driven into captivity; for, along with their native country, they had lost their liberty, and were entirely in the power, and at the disposal, of the conqueror. And yet we ought carefully to observe this metaphor, that the Church is oppressed by the tyranny of princes, and exposed to the jaws of wolves, and nevertheless is supposed to be their \u201cjust\u201d prey. This is, indeed, shamefully wicked; but thus were our fathers treated, and we are not more virtuous or more excellent than our fathers. <\/p>",
