    "html": "<p>As descendants of King David, Ahaz and his cabinet of princes are known as the &ldquo;house of David.&rdquo; The ten-tribed Northern Kingdom of Israel, often led by a ruler of the tribe of Ephraim, is known simply as &ldquo;Ephraim&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc4OTgiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 11:13<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\">Hosea 5:3-14<\/a>). Besides implying a time of judgment, storm imagery identifies the king&rsquo;s fear with that of his people, denoting a single reprobate category. Jehovah&rsquo;s people and the nations who yield to fear aren&rsquo;t the righteous but the wicked (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc4MjAiOjR9LHsiMTc5MDMiOjF9LHsiMTgyOTQiOjF9LHsiMTg0NTciOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 8:12-15; 12:2; 33:14; 41:5<\/a>). As here, Isaiah uses the metaphor of &ldquo;trees&rdquo; to represent people (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc5MzciOjF9LHsiMTgzNzciOjF9LHsiMTg4NDciOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 14:8; 37:24; 61:3<\/a>).<\/p>",
