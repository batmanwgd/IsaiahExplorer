    "html": "<p>The Day of Jehovah that comes as &ldquo;a violent blow from the Almighty&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgyODYiOjF9XQ==\">v 6<\/a>) parallels the Day of Jehovah that comes as &ldquo;a cruel outburst of anger and wrath&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgyODkiOjF9XQ==\">v 9<\/a>), again identifying the king of Assyria\/Babylon&mdash;Jehovah&rsquo;s <em>anger<\/em> and <em>wrath<\/em>&mdash;as the one who instigates it. As this is &ldquo;An oracle concerning Babylon&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgyODEiOjJ9XQ==\">vv 1, 19<\/a>), we begin to discern Isaiah&rsquo;s definition of Babylon as both a people and a place&mdash;the &ldquo;earth&rdquo; and its &ldquo;sinners&rdquo; on the eve of their destruction (cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgyOTEiOjF9XQ==\">v 11<\/a>). In effect, as Zion is both a people and a place&mdash;those of Israel who repent and the place of their return (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc2ODIiOjF9LHsiMTgzMzEiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 1:27; 35:10<\/a>)&mdash;so is Babylon.<\/p>",
