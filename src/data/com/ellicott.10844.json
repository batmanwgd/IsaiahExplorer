    "html": "<p>             (10) Make the heart of this people fat.\u2014The thought is the same as that of the \u201chardening\u201d of Pharaoh\u2019s heart (<a class=\"ref\">Exodus 8:19; Exodus 9:34<\/a>, &c) and that of Sihon (<a class=\"ref\">Deuteronomy 2:30<\/a>). It implies the reckless headstrong will which defies restraint and warnings. So the poets of Greece, in their thoughts as to the Divine government of the world, recognised the truth that there is a judicial blindness and, as it were, insanity of will that comes as the consequence of sinful deeds ( \u00c6sch. Agam. 370-386). The mediaeval adage, \u201cQuem Deus vult perdere prius dementat,\u201d expresses one aspect of the same law; but the vult perdere is excluded by the clearer revelation of the Divine purpose (<a class=\"ref\">Ezekiel 18:23; 1 Timothy 2:4; 2 Peter 2:9<\/a>), as \u201cnot willing that any should perish.\u201d<\/p>\n <p>Shut their eyes.\u2014Literally, as in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTgyMDQ=\">Isaiah 29:10<\/a>, daub, or besmear. Possibly the phrase refers to the barbarous practice, not unknown in the East, of thus closing the eyes as a punishment. Burder (Oriental Customs, i. 98) mentions a son of the Great Mogul who was thus punished by his father. For the ethical fact, as well as for the phrase, we may (with Cheyne) compare Shakespeare\u2014<\/p>\n <p>\u201cFor when we in our viciousness grow hard,<\/p>\n <p>Oh, misery on\u2019t, the wise gods seal our eyes.\u201d<\/p>",
