While the faithful woman&mdash;the Woman Zion, an elect category of Jehovah&rsquo;s people&mdash;sees covenant curses turn into blessings, the unfaithful woman sees covenant blessings turn into curses. The fact that Jehovah&rsquo;s people who are &ldquo;cast off&rdquo; suffer the identical curses as the Harlot Babylon (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc2NzYiOjExfSx7IjE3NzY0IjoyfSx7IjE3ODQzIjo5fSx7IjE4NDk5Ijo4fSx7IjE4NjA4Ijo4fSx7IjE4NzczIjo3fV0=\">Isaiah 1:21-31; 5:24-25; 9:13-21; 42:18-25; 47:8-15; 57:7-13<\/a>) implies that they become a part of Isaiah&rsquo;s Babylon category.<\/p>",
