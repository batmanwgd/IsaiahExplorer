    "html": "<p>             (5) And the Lord will create . . .\u2014The verb \u201ccreate\u201d has all the solemn force with which we find it in <a class=\"ref\">Genesis 1:1<\/a>. It is one of Isaiah\u2019s favourite words. The word for \u201cdwelling-place\u201d is almost invariably used for the tabernacle or temple, and would seem to have that meaning here. This determines the character of the \u201cassemblies.\u201d They are not the meetings of the people for counsel or debate, as in a Greek ecclesia, but their \u201cgatherings,\u201d their \u201csolemn assemblies,\u201d in the courts of the temple. The thoughts of the prophet travel back to the history of the Exodus, when the presence of Jehovah was manifested as a cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night (<a class=\"ref\">Exodus 13:21; Numbers 9:15; Numbers 10:34; Numbers 14:14<\/a>). In that Presence there would be safety and peace. The image is a favourite one with Isaiah, possibly as connected with the vision of <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTc3NzQ=\">Isaiah 6:4<\/a>, for God\u2019s protection of His people.<\/p>\n <p>Upon all the glory shall be a defence.\u2014The phrase is almost startlingly abrupt. The thought seems to be that over the \u201cglory\u201d of the new Jerusalem, as just described, there shall be stretched the overarching canopy of the Divine Love. The word for \u201cdefence\u201d occurs in this sense in <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 19:5, Joel 2:16<\/a>, and is still used by Jews of the \u201ccanopy\u201d held over bride and bridegroom at a wedding. The \u201cbaldacchino\u201d over the altar of an Italian church probably represents the image that was present to Isaiah\u2019s mind.<\/p>",
