    "html": "<p>Jehovah&rsquo;s empowering his <em>arm<\/em>&mdash;his end-time servant&mdash;follows the type his empowering Moses, who led Israel&rsquo;s ancient exodus out of Egypt: &ldquo;Then his people recalled the days of Moses of old: &lsquo;Where is he who brought them up out of the Sea with the shepherd of his flock? Where is he who put into him his holy Spirit, who made his glorious arm proceed at the right hand of Moses, who divided the waters before them, making an everlasting name for himself when he led them through the deep?&rsquo;&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg4NzgiOjN9XQ==\">Isaiah 63:11-13<\/a>). Word links&mdash;<em>Sea<\/em>, <em>arm<\/em>, &ldquo;waters,&rdquo; and <em>deep<\/em>&mdash;connect these and other passages.<\/p><p>Jehovah&rsquo;s empowering his <em>arm<\/em>&mdash;which resembles his rising from the dead (cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgxNTAiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 26:19<\/a>)&mdash;sets in motion the deliverance of his people: Jehovah&rsquo;s <em>arm<\/em> heralds salvation to the nations of the world (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg3MDciOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 52:10<\/a>), performs Jehovah&rsquo;s will in Babylon (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg2MjkiOjJ9XQ==\">Isaiah 48:14-15<\/a>), gathers and leads Jehovah&rsquo;s flock (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg0MzEiOjJ9XQ==\">Isaiah 40:10-11<\/a>), and subdues Assyria (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgyNDgiOjN9XQ==\">Isaiah 30:30-32<\/a>). Inextricably linked to Jehovah&rsquo;s empowerment of his <em>arm<\/em> is his people&rsquo;s new exodus to Zion (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgyMjkiOjF9XQ==\">v 11<\/a>). Patterned after Israel&rsquo;s ancient exodus, it requires power over the elements such as Moses exercised on the seraph level (<a class=\"ref\">Exodus 14:15-31<\/a>).<\/p><p>Jehovah&rsquo;s <em>arm<\/em> awakening, arising, and being clothed with power thus signifies the servant&rsquo;s ascent to seraph status. His carving up Rahab and slaying the <em>dragon<\/em> recalls the role of Moses in subduing Egypt and its Pharaoh (cf. <a class=\"ref\">Ezekiel 29:3; Revelation 12:1-13:4<\/a>) and of the angel who went before the camp of Israel (<a class=\"ref\">Exodus 14:19; Numbers 20:16<\/a>; <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg4NzYiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 63:9<\/a>). The servant&rsquo;s drying up the <em>Sea<\/em>, the waters of the <em>deep<\/em>, denotes his victory over the archtyrant that makes possible the release of Jehovah&rsquo;s captives from bondage (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc4NzUiOjR9LHsiMTg2NjUiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 10:24-27; 50:2<\/a>) and their exodus to Zion (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc5MDAiOjJ9LHsiMTg1MjIiOjJ9XQ==\">Isaiah 11:15-16; 43:16-17<\/a>).<\/p>",
