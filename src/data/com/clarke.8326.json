The MSS. vary in expressing or omitting the <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d5 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">vau<\/span>, in these four words. Ten MSS. of Kennicott are without the <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d5 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">vau<\/span>  in the second word, and eight MSS. are without the <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d5 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">vau<\/span>  in the fourth word; which justifies Symmachus, who has rendered them passively: <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u03bf\u0314 \u03b1\u03b8\u03b5\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03b1\u03b8\u03b5\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bf\u0314 \u03c4\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9\u03c0\u03c9\u03c1\u03b9\u03b6\u03c9\u03bd \u03c4\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9\u03c0\u03c9\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9<\/span> .

Cocceius (Lexicon in voce) observes that the Chaldee very often renders the verb <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d1\u05d2\u05d3 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">bagad<\/span>, by <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d1\u05d6\u05d6 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">bazaz<\/span>, he spoiled; and in this place, and in  <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTgyODE=\">Isaiah 33:1<\/a>, by the equivalent word <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d0\u05e0\u05e1 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">anas<\/span>, to press, give trouble; and in  <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTgxMTI=\">Isaiah 24:16<\/a>; both by <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d0\u05e0\u05e1 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">anas<\/span>  and <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d1\u05d6\u05d6 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">bazaz<\/span> ; and the Syriac in this place renders it by <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d8\u05dc\u05dd <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">talam<\/span>, he oppressed.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>All the sighing thereof have I made to cease \"I have put an end to all her vexations\" -<\/em>Hebrews \"Her sighing; that is, the sighing caused by her.\" So Kimchi on the place: \"It means those who groaned through fear of him: for the suffixes of the nouns refer both to the agent and the patient. All those who groaned before the face of the king of Babylon he caused to rest;\" Chald. And so likewise Ephrem Syr. in loc., edit.
