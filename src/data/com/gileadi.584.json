The terms &ldquo;dispute,&rdquo; &ldquo;bring charges,&rdquo; and &ldquo;incriminate&rdquo; indicate that he doesn&rsquo;t lack enemies. Rather than confront him, however, they collude behind his back: &ldquo;They work in the dark, thinking, &lsquo;Who will see us?&rsquo;&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgyMDkiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 29:15<\/a>). In the end, those who ostracize him are consumed by &ldquo;moths&rdquo;&mdash;a covenant curse (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg2ODEiOjJ9XQ==\">Isaiah 51:7-8<\/a>).<\/p>",
