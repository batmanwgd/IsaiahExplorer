    "html": "<p>Isaiah&rsquo;s depicting Jehovah&rsquo;s people as two cities, one righteous, the other wicked, has a parallel in two women or wives, one faithful, the other unfaithful. The imagery of a woman who typifies Jehovah&rsquo;s covenant relationship with his people thus divides into that of two women: (1) &ldquo;a wife married in youth only to be rejected&rdquo; for her unfaithfulness, but whom Jehovah now remarries (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">vv 5-6<\/a>); and (2) the wife currently married, whom Jehovah now rejects for her unfaithfulness: &ldquo;Surely by sinning you sold yourselves; because of your crimes is your mother cast off&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTg2NjQ=\">Isaiah 50:1<\/a>; cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3sic2luZ2xlcyI6WzE3Njc2XX0seyIxODc2OSI6MTF9XQ==\">1:21; 57:3-13<\/a>).<\/p><p>A reversal of circumstances takes place when the natural lineages of Jehovah&rsquo;s people who anciently rejected their covenant Lord renew their relationship with him&mdash;while, at the same time, the assimilated lineages of his people who displaced them now reject him through their idolatries (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3sic2luZ2xlcyI6WzE4NDk4LDE4NTQ5LDE4NTgyXX0seyIxODU4OCI6Mn1d\">Isaiah 42:17; 44:15; 45:20; 46:1-2<\/a>). In the millennial age of peace, the &ldquo;children&rdquo; or &ldquo;sons&rdquo; (<em>banim<\/em>) who are born to the remarried spouse&mdash;a chief covenant blessing&mdash;far exceed those of the spouse who is cast off. She who was &ldquo;barren&rdquo; during the intervening centuries has cause to rejoice (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 49:20-22<\/a>).<\/p>",
