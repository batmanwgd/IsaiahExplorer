    "html": "<p>While spreading forth the hands and praying at length are two legitimate forms of prayer, they can&rsquo;t benefit an unrepentant people guilty of gross crimes. The word &ldquo;blood&rdquo; not only implies extreme injustice (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTUyLDE4ODA0LDE4ODA4XQ==\">Isaiah 26:21; 59:3, 7<\/a>), it encapsulates injustices in general. Although &ldquo;hands filled with blood&rdquo; alludes to murder and abortion, it further epitomizes societal failings and abuses whose ripple effects include suicides to which an unrighteous people contribute. In short, the worship of Jehovah by those whose hearts aren&rsquo;t broken, whose spirits aren&rsquo;t contrite (<a class=\"ref\">Psalm 51:16-17<\/a>), Jehovah can&rsquo;t countenance.<\/p>",
