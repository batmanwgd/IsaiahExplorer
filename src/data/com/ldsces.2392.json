    "html": "<p>Alfred Martin, in his work on Isaiah, gave an excellent answer to this question: &ldquo;Cyrus is the only Gentile king who is called God&rsquo;s &lsquo;anointed.&rsquo; Since this is the translation of the Hebrew word which we spell in English as <em>Messiah,<\/em> Cyrus is in a sense a type of the Anointed One, the Lord Jesus Christ. Typology is often misunderstood and abused. A type is a divinely appointed prophetic symbol, usually of Christ. When a person or a thing is called a type, that does not alter its literal meaning or deny its historical reality. Cyrus was a Persian king, and we have no evidence that he ever really knew the true God, although the Persian religion was relatively free from the gross idolatries of the Babylonians. Consequently when it is asserted that Cyrus is a type of Christ, it is not said that he was like the Lord Jesus Christ in every respect. The only intended resemblance is in the fact that Cyrus was the anointed one who delivered the people of Israel from their captivity. As such he points us to the greater Anointed One who saves His people from their sins.&rdquo; (<em>Isaiah, the Salvation of Jehovah,<\/em> pp. 77&ndash;78.)<\/p><p class=\"cite\">LDS Church Educational System Old Testament Student Manual, 1 Kings&ndash;Malachi, Religion 302, Chapter 16, Item 31<\/p>",
