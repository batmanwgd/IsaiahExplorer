    "html": "<p>Hezekiah&rsquo;s intercessory prayer on behalf of his people gets an immediate response from Jehovah through his prophet Isaiah. Using the imagery of a young woman who rejects the overtures of an unwanted suitor, Isaiah depicts Hezekiah&rsquo;s people as the Virgin Daughter of Zion and the Daughter of Jerusalem. From formerly being identified with the Jacob\/Israel category of Jehovah&rsquo;s people (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NjU4LDE3ODM4LDE3ODcxXQ==\">Isaiah 1:3; 9:8; 10:20<\/a>), they are now identified as Zion\/Jerusalem. At the same time, Isaiah shows the character traits of people on that level. Having passed Jehovah&rsquo;s test of their loyalties, they have spiritually ascended.<\/p><p>As the only instance of the name &ldquo;Virgin Daughter of Zion&rdquo; in the Book of Isaiah, that distinguishes it from the usual name &ldquo;Daughter of Zion&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NjYzLDE3OTcxLDE4ODY2XQ==\">Isaiah 1:8; 16:1; 62:11<\/a>). While the latter designates a &ldquo;holy&rdquo; or elect category of Jehovah&rsquo;s people (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3sic2luZ2xlcyI6WzE3NzM3LDE4Njk4XX0seyIxODg2NiI6Mn1d\">Isaiah 4:3; 52:1; 62:11-12<\/a>)&mdash;Jehovah&rsquo;s wife whom he marries and who bears him children (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3sic2luZ2xlcyI6WzE4NzI5LDE4ODYwXX0seyIxODkzMSI6Mn1d\">Isaiah 54:5; 62:5; 66:8-9<\/a>)&mdash;the name &ldquo;Virgin Daughter of Zion&rdquo; points Jehovah&rsquo;s people who have just attained the Zion\/Jerusalem category to that higher or elect category, to which some living among them may in fact already have ascended.<\/p>",
