    "html": "<p><a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTgwODM=\">Isaiah 23:5<\/a>.<i>As at the report concerning Egypt, <\/i>&c. \u2014 \u201cThe words, as they stand in our translation, imply, that the Zidonians, spoken of <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTgwODI=\">Isaiah 23:4<\/a>, or in general other neighbouring places, should be as much concerned at the news of the destruction of Tyre as they were at the calamity of Egypt, mentioned chap. 19. But there is a difficulty in admitting this sense, because the destruction of Tyre here spoken of was before that of Egypt, if we mean that calamity of Egypt which is usually joined with the destruction of Tyre in the prophets: see <a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 25:19; Jeremiah 25:22; Ezekiel 29:18-20<\/a>. Therefore others read this verse thus: <i>As soon as the report of Tyre shall come to, <\/i>or <i>be heard in, Egypt, they shall be in great pain <\/i>for it; namely, because they exported their corn to Tyre, and made a gainful trade by it.\u201d \u2014 Lowth.<\/p>",
