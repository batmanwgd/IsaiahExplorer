We are sure to find the grace of Christ, published by himself to a  lost world in the everlasting gospel, under the type and figure of  Isaiah's province, which was to foretel the deliverance of the Jews out  of Babylon,   <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODg0NSI6M30=\">Isaiah 61:1-3<\/a>.  II. We think we find the glories of the church of Christ, its  spiritual glories, described under the type and figure of the Jews'  prosperity after their return out of their captivity.  1. It is promised that they decays of the church shall be repaired,   <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTg4NDg=\">Isaiah 61:4<\/a>.  2. That those from without shall be made serviceable to the church,   <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTg4NDk=\">Isaiah 61:5<\/a>.  3. That the church shall be a royal priesthood, maintained by the  riches of the Gentiles,   <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTg4NTA=\">Isaiah 61:6<\/a>.  4. That she shall have honour and joy in lieu of all her shame and  sorrow,   <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTg4NTE=\">Isaiah 61:7<\/a>.  5. That her affairs shall prosper,   <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTg4NTI=\">Isaiah 61:8<\/a>.  6. That prosperity shall enjoy these blessings,   <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTg4NTM=\">Isaiah 61:9<\/a>.  7. That righteousness and salvation shall be the eternal matter of the  church's rejoicing and thanksgiving,   <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTg4NTQ=\">Isaiah 61:10<\/a>.  If the Jewish church was ever thus blessed, much more shall the  Christian church be so, and all that belong to it.<\/p>",
