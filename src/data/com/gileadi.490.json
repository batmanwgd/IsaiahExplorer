Even when calamities come upon them, many don&rsquo;t perceive that they themselves are the cause, that they brought covenant curses on their own heads. To &ldquo;take heed&rdquo; and &ldquo;obey&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t come easily to sinners who reject Jehovah&rsquo;s law and repudiate his messenger, thereby setting limits on what Jehovah can do for them.<\/p>",
