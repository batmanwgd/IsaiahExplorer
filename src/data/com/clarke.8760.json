That it was there the Septuagint show by rendering <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d4\u05de\u05e6\u05d9\u05e7\u05da <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">hammetsikech<\/span>  <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u03b8\u03bb\u03b9\u03b2\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c3\u03b5<\/span>, of him, that oppressed thee. And so they render this word in both its places in this verse. The Vulgate also has the pronoun in the first instance; <i>furoris ejus qui te tribulabat<\/i>.\" Dr. Jubb. The correction seems well founded; I have not conformed the translation to it, because it makes little difference in the sense.<\/p>",
