    "html": "<p>President Joseph Fielding Smith described the ensign and its significance:<\/p><p>&ldquo;Over 125 years ago, in the little town of Fayette, Seneca County, New York, the Lord set up an ensign to the nations. It was in fulfilment of the prediction made by the Prophet Isaiah, which I have read. That ensign was the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which was established for the last time, never again to be destroyed or given to other people. It was the greatest event the world has seen since the day that the Redeemer was lifted upon the cross and worked out the infinite and eternal atonement. It meant more to mankind than anything else that has occurred since that day. &hellip;<\/p><p>&ldquo;Following the raising of this ensign, the Lord sent forth his elders clothed with the priesthood and with power and authority, among the nations of the earth, bearing witness unto all peoples of the restoration of his Church, and calling upon the children of men to repent and receive the gospel; for now it was being preached in all the world as a witness before the end should come, that is, the end of the reign of wickedness and the establishment of the millennial reign of peace. The elders went forth as they were commanded, and are still preaching the gospel and gathering out from the nations the seed of Israel unto whom the promise was made.&rdquo; (<em>Doctrines of Salvation,<\/em> 3:254&ndash;55; see also <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTc3NjY=\">Isaiah 5:26<\/a>.)<\/p><p class=\"cite\">LDS Church Educational System Old Testament Student Manual, 1 Kings&ndash;Malachi, Religion 302, Chapter 13, Item 61<\/p>",
