    "html": "<p>Following the tests of loyalty Jehovah orchestrates for his people and individuals that characterize their descent phase through trials and afflictions, the blessings of an unconditional <em>collective<\/em> covenant finally rest upon them: an unending &ldquo;peace&rdquo; (<em>salom<\/em>) and the &ldquo;bounty&rdquo; or &ldquo;glory&rdquo; (<em>kabod<\/em>) of the &ldquo;nations&rdquo; or &ldquo;Gentiles&rdquo; (<em>goyim<\/em>). While many in the Jacob\/Israel category fail to attain &ldquo;peace like a river&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg2MzMiOjJ9LHsiMTg2MzMiOjN9XQ==\">Isaiah 48:18-19, Isaiah 48:18-19, 22<\/a>), many who ascend and are reborn on higher spiritual levels attain it by an everlasting &ldquo;covenant of peace&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg3MzQiOjN9XQ==\">Isaiah 54:10, 13-14<\/a>; cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc4MzYiOjJ9LHsiMTgxMzQiOjF9LHsiMTgyNzYiOjN9LHsiMTgzMDAiOjF9LHsiMTg3NjciOjR9XQ==\">9:6-7; 26:3; 32:16-18; 33:20; 57:1-2, 18-19<\/a>).<\/p><p>Jehovah&rsquo;s comforting his people forms a consistent pattern in his dealings with them: &ldquo;&lsquo;Comfort and give solace to my people,&rsquo; says your God; &lsquo;speak kindly to Jerusalem&rsquo;&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg0MjIiOjJ9XQ==\">Isaiah 40:1-2<\/a>); &ldquo;Jehovah is comforting his people, showing compassion for his afflicted&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg2NTAiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 49:13<\/a>). He purposefully brings them through the most difficult trials&mdash;through times when all supports seem to fail&mdash;leaving them one recourse: to turn to him for help. Their exercise of faith in him in the midst of their descent phase is the very thing that occasions their deliverance and personal experience of him (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgzMjQiOjJ9XQ==\">Isaiah 35:3-4<\/a>).<\/p>",
