They reduce &ldquo;mountains&rdquo; and &ldquo;hills&rdquo;&mdash;the nations (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3sic2luZ2xlcyI6WzE3OTExXX0seyIxODg4NyI6M31d\">Isaiah 13:4; 64:1-3<\/a>)&mdash;to chaos. Micah concurs: &ldquo;The breaker has risen before them. They have broken through and passed through the gate and gone out by it. Their king will pass before them and Jehovah at their head&rdquo; (<a class=\"ref\">Micah 2:13<\/a>); &ldquo;Arise and thresh, O Daughter of Zion, for I will make your horn iron and your hooves brass, and you will beat in pieces many peoples&rdquo; (<a class=\"ref\">Micah 4:13<\/a>).<\/p><p>At their great victory, Jehovah&rsquo;s people who return from exile have cause to &ldquo;rejoice&rdquo; in their God and give him the &ldquo;glory&rdquo;: &ldquo;You have enlarged the nation and increased its joy; they rejoice at your presence as men rejoice at harvest time, or as men are joyous when they divide spoil. For you have smashed the yoke that burdened them, the staff of submission, the rod of those who subjected them, as in the Day of Midian&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 9:3-4<\/a>). In the present instance, <em>wind<\/em> and <em>tempest<\/em> imagery&mdash;signifying Jehovah&rsquo;s Day of Judgment&mdash;denotes Jehovah&rsquo;s servant whom Jehovah empowers (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3OTAwLDE3OTk3XQ==\">Isaiah 11:15; 17:13<\/a>).<\/p>",
