Although few may &ldquo;give heed,&rdquo; &ldquo;hear,&rdquo; &ldquo;be attentive,&rdquo; or &ldquo;listen&rdquo; to his <em>voice<\/em> (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg2NzMiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 50:10<\/a>), those who do Jehovah personally &ldquo;instructs&rdquo; and &ldquo;directs.&rdquo; Like the plowman, who doesn&rsquo;t plow the same ground over and over but moves on and plants crops so that the land may yield its abundance, so his discerning people use wisdom and discretion in implementing Jehovah&rsquo;s word.<\/p>",
