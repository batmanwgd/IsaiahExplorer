When Egypt&rsquo;s grain, which enriched world traders, suddenly becomes unavailable, those who depend on it suffer its loss: &ldquo;Up, and listen to my voice, O complacent women; you careless daughters, hear my words! In little more than a year you shall be in anguish, O carefree ones, for when the harvest is over, the produce shall fail to arrive&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgyNjkiOjJ9XQ==\">Isaiah 32:9-10<\/a>). Jehovah&rsquo;s elect, on the other hand, prepare for that day: &ldquo;Tell the righteous it shall be well with them; they shall eat the fruits of their own labors&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc3MTgiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 3:10<\/a>).<\/p>",
