When He had finished, &ldquo;the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him&rdquo; (<a class=\"ref\">Luke 4:20<\/a>). He then said, &ldquo;This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W10=\">v. 21<\/a>; see <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W10=\">vv. 16&ndash;19<\/a>). These verses in Isaiah relate to Jesus as does the rest of <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODg0NSI6MTF9\">Isaiah 61<\/a>&mdash;to Him and to the building of His Zion in the latter days. He it is who is appointed of the Father to preach the gospel unto men, to heal or provide forgiveness to the wounded soul, to preach deliverance to those captives in the spirit prison (see <a class=\"ref\">1 Peter 3:18&ndash;19<\/a>). Jesus Himself cited this passage as evidence of His divinity (see <a class=\"ref\">Matthew 11:2&ndash;5; Luke 7:19&ndash;22<\/a>).<\/p><p class=\"cite\">LDS Church Educational System Old Testament Student Manual, 1 Kings&ndash;Malachi, Religion 302, Chapter 18, Item 18<\/p>",
