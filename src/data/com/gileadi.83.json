    "html": "<p>Isaiah likens Jehovah&rsquo;s people going to their death to Sheol (<em>se&rsquo;ol<\/em>)&mdash;the &ldquo;underworld,&rdquo; &ldquo;Hell,&rdquo; or &ldquo;spirit prison&rdquo;&mdash;devouring them like a gluttonous woman. The word <em>mouth<\/em> additionally serves as a pseudonym of the archtyrant. Daniel and John depict him as &ldquo;a <em>mouth<\/em> speaking great things&rdquo; (<a class=\"ref\">Daniel 7:8, 20; Revelation 13:5<\/a>; emphasis added). Isaiah portrays him as a beast &ldquo;bellowing&rdquo; and &ldquo;snorting&rdquo; against Jehovah (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTgzODI=\">Isaiah 37:29<\/a>): &ldquo;Whom have you mocked and ridiculed? Against whom have you raised your voice, lifting your eyes to high heaven? Against the Holy One of Israel!&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTgzNzY=\">Isaiah 37:23<\/a>).<\/p>",
