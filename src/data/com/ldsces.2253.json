    "html": "<p>The gathering of Israel in haste and with means not known in Isaiah&rsquo;s day is portrayed in the conclusion of this chapter. Elder LeGrand Richards provided this modern-day application of the prophet&rsquo;s words: &ldquo;Since there were neither trains nor airplanes in that day, Isaiah could hardly have mentioned them by name. However, he seems to have described them in unmistakable words. How better could &lsquo;their horses&rsquo; hoofs be counted like flint, and their wheels like a whirlwind&rsquo; than in the modern train? How better could &lsquo;their roaring &hellip; be like a lion&rsquo; than in the roar of the airplane? Trains and airplanes do not stop for night. Therefore, was not Isaiah justified in saying: &lsquo;none shall slumber nor sleep; neither shall the girdle of their loins be loosed, nor the latchet of their shoes be broken&rsquo;? With this manner of transportation the Lord can really &lsquo;hiss unto them from the end of the earth,&rsquo; that &lsquo;they shall come with speed swiftly.&rsquo;&rdquo; (<em>Israel! Do You Know?,<\/em> p. 182.)<\/p><p>The expression &ldquo;ensign to the nations&rdquo; is discussed in Notes and Commentary on Isaiah 11:10, 12.<\/p><p class=\"cite\">LDS Church Educational System Old Testament Student Manual, 1 Kings&ndash;Malachi, Religion 302, Chapter 13, Item 29<\/p>",
