Going through the motions of religious observance&mdash;as if that makes them righteous before God&mdash;they still lack true devotion. They fast from food and observe the Sabbath (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W10=\">v 13<\/a>) but without it benefiting them. When they complain, he responds through his servant&mdash;their exemplar of <em>righteousness<\/em>&mdash;that the root of their problem is their transgressing his law and word: &ldquo;It is your iniquities that separate you from your God; your sins hide his face, so that he does not hear you&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTg4MDM=\">Isaiah 59:2<\/a>; cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTc2NzA=\">1:15<\/a>).<\/p>",
