    "html": "<p><i>King.<\/i>  Ezechias or Josias, as figures of Jesus Christ, who is meant.  (Calmet) --- They and their counsellors only foreshewed the advantages derived from Christ and his apostles in a more abundant manner.  (St. Jerome) --- <i>Judgment and justice.<\/i>  These words have a higher meaning than what is assigned to them by philosophers.  In God, the former implies the preparation of the means for man's redemption, as the latter does the execution; and in man, <i>judgment<\/i> denotes the selection of what is right, and <i>justice<\/i> implies the putting it willingly in practice.  Thus Christ will fulfill all the he has graciously purposed, with the two other divine persons; and the <i>princes,<\/i> his pastors, shall discern what is good for their own and people's eternal welfare.  (Worthington)<\/p>",
