Accomplished individuals decrease and principled persons are marginalized as people turn selfish and hedonistic. In the end, law and order break down, commerce declines, and people fall prey to society&rsquo;s lowest elements. When those who hold communities together, whose duty is to safeguard against corruption, become corrupt themselves, a nation disintegrates from within. A common denominator in such cases is Jehovah&rsquo;s people forgetting their God (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzk5NCI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 17:10-11<\/a>).<\/p>",
