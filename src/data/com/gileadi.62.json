In their attempts to please men, they contrive ways to attract their attention instead of placing their confidence in God. That these are &ldquo;women of Zion&rdquo; signifies that they&mdash;like the faithful city that becomes a harlot (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc2NzYiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 1:21<\/a>)&mdash;may once have belonged to Isaiah&rsquo;s Zion\/Jerusalem category, but instead of ascending further spiritually they have descended.<\/p>",
