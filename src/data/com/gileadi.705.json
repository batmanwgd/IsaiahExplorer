Jehovah saw that there was no justice, and it displeased him. When he saw it, he wondered why there was no man, no one who would intercede&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg4MTYiOjJ9XQ==\">Isaiah 59:15-16<\/a>); &ldquo;He was despised and disdained by men, a man of grief, accustomed to suffering. As one from whom men hide their faces he was shunned, deemed by us of no merit&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg3MTUiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 53:3<\/a>). While paying the price of justice for all, Jehovah faces his oppressors alone (<a class=\"ref\">Psalm 22:1<\/a>; <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg1MTciOjJ9XQ==\">Isaiah 43:11-12<\/a>).<\/p><p>Jehovah&rsquo;s suffering his enemies&rsquo; wrath, anger, and rage when he is &ldquo;cut off from the land of the living for the crime of my people to whom the blow was due&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg3MjAiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 53:8<\/a>) personally acquaints him with the <em>wrath<\/em>, <em>anger<\/em>, and <em>rage<\/em> of tyrants such as the king of Assyria\/Babylon whom he appoints to destroy and subjugate the wicked (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc4NTYiOjJ9LHsiMTgzNzkiOjJ9XQ==\">Isaiah 10:5-6; 37:26-27<\/a>). The spiritual and temporal<em>salvation<\/em> that flows directly from Jehovah to all who repent he himself personifies by &ldquo;making his life an offering for guilt&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg3MjIiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 53:10<\/a>; cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg1MTgiOjF9XQ==\">43:12<\/a>). His <em>arm<\/em>&mdash;his intervention&mdash;alone, therefore, is the hope of humanity.<\/p>",
