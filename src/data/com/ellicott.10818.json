In Judah, as elsewhere, the oppressors were conspicuous for their luxury (<a class=\"ref\">Amos 6:5-6<\/a>). They shocked public feeling by morning banquets (<a class=\"ref\">Ecclesiastes 10:16-17; Acts 2:14<\/a>). Not wine only, but the \u201cstrong drink\u201d made from honey and from dates and other fruits (possibly including, as a generic term, the beer for which Egypt was famous) was seen on their tables. The morning feast was followed, perhaps with hardly a break, by an evening revel.
