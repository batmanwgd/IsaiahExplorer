The whole nation express all their mournful accents by these three monosyllables.<\/p>\n\n<p>This chapter contains the following parts: - <\/p><ol>  <li>We have here blessed promises of the latter-day glory.<\/li><\/ol>  <li>The prophet may be considered as addressing the teachers of the Gospel, to show them that it was their business to encourage and direct the people in their expectation of redemption.<\/li><li>A promise of the manifestation of God among men is given.<\/li><li>The miracles which Christ should work are explicitly mentioned.<\/li><li>The privileges of Christianity are specified; there shall be,<\/li>     1. Thorough teaching;\n\n<p>2. Holy walking.<\/p><ol> <li>Perfect safety.<\/li><li>Complete happiness. And - <\/li><\/ol>   <li>Final glory.<\/li> The chapter shows also that no impurity should be tolerated in the Church of God; for as that is the mystical body of Christ, it should be like himself, without spot or wrinkle, or any such thing.",
