    "html": "<p>Because so many men are killed in the great war (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc3MzMiOjJ9XQ==\">Isaiah 3:25-26<\/a>), a disproportionate number of women survives &ldquo;in that day&rdquo;&mdash;Jehovah&rsquo;s Day of Judgment. Another reason may be that in general women are more righteous than men, perhaps even by a ratio of seven to one. In contrast to the flirting women we saw previously (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc3MjQiOjl9XQ==\">Isaiah 3:16-24<\/a>), these women are under no covenant curse, having prepared a sufficiency of food and clothing in anticipation of the evil time (cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc3MTgiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 3:10<\/a>). They consider it a &ldquo;reproach&rdquo; not to raise their own families, and they appeal to the men who remain to marry them.<\/p>",
