Not that this was in itself absolutely unlawful, but because they did it from an inordinate desire of riches, and with the injury of their brethren. <i>That they may be placed alone <\/i>\u2014 That they alone may be the lords and owners, and all others only their tenants and servants. Thus, \u201cthe first crime condemned is avarice and rapacity; which is strongly described in this verse, and which prevailed remarkably among the Jews. Its punishment, even the desolation of those houses which they coveted, and the devastation of those fields which they obtained so rapaciously, is set forth in the two following verses.\u201d See Vitringa. <i>In mine ears, said the Lord <\/i>\u2014 That is, <i>It was revealed in mine ears: <\/i>or, I heard God speak what I am now about to utter. <i>Of a truth many houses shall be desolate <\/i>\u2014 \u201cIn vain are ye so intent upon joining house to house, and field to field; your houses shall be left uninhabited, and your fields shall become desolate and barren: so that a vineyard of ten acres shall produce but one bath (not eight gallons) of wine, and the husbandman shall reap but a tenth part of the seed which he has sown.\u201d \u2014 Bishop Lowth. Thus it is predicted that a fruitful land should be made barren for their wickedness, according to God\u2019s threatening, (<a class=\"ref\">Psalms 107:34<\/a>,) and they would have as little comfort in their lands as in their houses.<\/p>",
