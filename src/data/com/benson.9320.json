    "html": "<p><a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTgzMDg=\">Isaiah 34:4<\/a>.<i>And all the host of heaven <\/i>\u2014 The sun, moon, and stars; <i>shall be dissolved <\/i>\u2014 We have frequently had occasion to observe, that, in the prophetic language, the heavenly luminaries represent kings, empires, and states: see note on <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTc5MTc=\">Isaiah 13:10<\/a>. The prophet here foretels the overthrow and dissolution of such states and kingdoms as were hostile to his church, whether under the Jewish or Christian dispensation. Or, alluding to a horrid tempest raging furiously, during which the heavens grow black, the sun disappears, and the stars seem to fall to the earth, and it appears as if the whole body of the heavens were about to be utterly dissolved, he intends to signify, that, during these destructive judgments, of which he speaks, the confusion and consternation of mankind would be as great as if all the frame of the creation were broken into pieces. Some, indeed, understand the words as intended of the day of general and final judgment, but the context preceding and following will not agree with such an interpretation. And it is very usual for the prophetic writers, both of the Old and New Testaments, to represent great and general changes and calamities in such words and phrases as properly agree to the day of judgment, and the dissolution of all things: as, on the contrary, they often set forth the glorious deliverances of God\u2019s people by such expressions as properly and literally belong to the resurrection from the dead.<\/p>",
