See Vitringa. <i>With a strong hand <\/i>\u2014 With a vehement and more than ordinary inspiration. The Chaldee renders it, <i>In <\/i><i>the strength of prophecy; <\/i>perhaps it refers to those ecstasies into which the prophets were frequently wrapt. <i>That I should not walk in the way of this people <\/i>\u2014 Of the generality of the people of Judah; whose imminent danger and calamity he foretold, (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTc4MTY=\">Isaiah 8:8<\/a>,) giving them, however, full assurance that God would deliver them out of it, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 8:9-10<\/a>. <i>Say ye not, A confederacy, <\/i>&c. \u2014 You, my people, be not associated with them in the confederacies which they are projecting: do not join with those that, for the securing of themselves, are for making a league with the Assyrians, through unbelief, and distrust of God and their cause: do not come into any such confederacy. <i>Neither fear ye their fear <\/i>\u2014 Be not afraid of the confederacy with which they frighten themselves and one another, namely, that between Syria and Ephraim; or that thing which they fear, that, if they do not call in the Assyrian succours, they shall be destroyed by those two potent kings. Thus, when sinful confederacies are formed against God\u2019s church and people by their enemies, they should guard against sinful fears of such confederacies.<\/p>",
