But it was literally fulfilled when they were reduced to that extremity that they ate the flesh of their own children, <a class=\"ref\">2 Kings 6:28; Jeremiah 19:8-9<\/a>; a judgment denounced for their sins by Moses, <a class=\"ref\">Deuteronomy 28:53<\/a>, where see the note. <i>They together shall fall on Judah <\/i>\u2014 When those tribes have preyed upon and nearly destroyed one another, they shall turn their rage on Judah. The prophet in the above verses describes the infatuation of the Israelites and Jews, who, instead of uniting in a confederacy against their common enemies, the Syrians and Assyrians, with whom they were not singly able to contend, fell out among themselves, and so far destroyed each other, that they became, one after the other, an easy prey to those heathen nations, whom, humanly speaking, they would have been able to have repelled, had they united in a league, and aided each other. But God suffered them to be infatuated, as a punishment of their sins. <\/p>",
