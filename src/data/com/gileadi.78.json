    "html": "<p>In an end-time context, &ldquo;Israel&rdquo; and &ldquo;Judah&rdquo; serve as codenames of those who are Jehovah&rsquo;s covenant people in that day. Their depiction as &ldquo;his cherished grove&rdquo; infers that in the beginning Jehovah doted over them. As the vines reach fruit-bearing age, however, they deeply disappoint him. The words &ldquo;He expected justice, but there was injustice; [he expected] righteousness, but there was an outcry&rdquo; (<em>wayeqaw lemispat wehinneh mispah lisdaqa wehinneh se&lsquo;aqa<\/em>) use assonance and alliteration to dramatize this disenchantment. The parallel terms &ldquo;injustice&rdquo; and &ldquo;outcry&rdquo; express grave ethical violations.<\/p>",
