    "html": "<p>Just as the covenant blessings of fertile and fruitful lands originate in the sky, so to speak, so all blessings originate with Jehovah who dwells in the heavens (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODgyLDE4OTI0XQ==\">Isaiah 63:15; 66:1<\/a>). Parallel verses show that Jehovah&rsquo;s desire and purpose are none other than to bless his people. His &ldquo;word,&rdquo; which issues from his <em>mouth<\/em>&mdash;his servant (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NjY3LDE4ODIyXQ==\">Isaiah 50:4; 59:21<\/a>)&mdash;is key to his sending forth blessings to achieve that end. When Jehovah&rsquo;s people live by his word&mdash;pure and unadulterated by the precepts of men&mdash;it becomes &ldquo;seed for the sower and food for the eater&rdquo; and yields an abundance of blessings (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">vv 1-2<\/a>).<\/p>",
