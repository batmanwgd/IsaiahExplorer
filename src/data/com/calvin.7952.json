    "html": "<p><i>And strangers shall stand. <\/i>He means that foreigners and strangers shall be ready to yield obedience to them; for, in consequence of their being at that time separated from the rest of the nations, none was willing to assist them, and therefore he says that \u201cstrangers stand;\u201c that is, are ready to meet and assist them. As to what follows, about \u201cfeeding sheep\u201d and \u201ccultivating fields and vines,\u201d these are metaphorical expressions; for the Prophet treats of the kingdom of Christ, which is spiritual, but by means of these figures describes its perfect happiness, that we may understand it better from examples drawn from those things which are known to us. Let us therefore understand that we shall be truly happy when Christ shall exercise his dominion over us; for in this way shall we likewise obtain, beyond expectation, many advantages of which the children of Adam are justly deprived. <\/p>",
