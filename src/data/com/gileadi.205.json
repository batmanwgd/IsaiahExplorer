By seeking to destroy Jehovah&rsquo;s righteous people together with the wicked of the world, the king of Assyria\/Babylon and his legions suffer the curses of Jehovah&rsquo;s covenants. Because offspring and descendants constitute the foremost covenant blessing pertaining to Jehovah&rsquo;s covenants, those who violate the rights of his elect inherit no offspring or descendants.<\/p>",
