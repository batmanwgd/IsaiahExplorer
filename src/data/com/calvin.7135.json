    "html": "<p><i>And they who work in the finest flax. <\/i>As he spoke of mourning, so he now speaks of shame; for they who formerly earned an abundant livelihood by this trade will have no gains. Now, the two occupations are closely connected, to weave nets and to fish. Yet it is doubtful if he speaks of those only who manufactured nets; for if we understand  <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05e9\u05e8\u05d9\u05e7\u05d5\u05ea<\/span>, (<i>s\u0115r\u012bk\u014dth<\/i>) to mean certain very fine linens, it is probable that the latter clause relates to other productions of the loom, manufactured out of small fine thread, and of the most elegant workmanship. We know that linens of very great value were woven in Egypt, and there may be good reason for interpreting the phrase <i>white nets, <\/i>or, as we have rendered it, \u201cperforated,\u201d to mean also linen garments, which were more costly in proportion to the greater delicacy of their texture. <\/p>\n<p>It will thus be a metaphorical expression, by which the Prophet indirectly taunts them with their unbecoming luxury, alleging that the Egyptians cover themselves with linen garments in the same manner as if they clothed themselves with a net. If this meaning be adopted, it will agree with the following verse; and indeed I do not see how such exquisite skill in weaving can be applied to fishing. But if it be thought better to understand the whole as relating to fishes, the meaning will be, that they who had been much employed in fishing, and had found it to be a profitable occupation, will be overwhelmed with sorrow.  <\/p>",
