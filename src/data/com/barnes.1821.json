The image of the female that was barren is kept up, and the idea is, that there should be no occasion of the shame which she felt who had no children.<\/p><p><em>For thou shalt forget the shame of thy youth<\/em>&mdash;In the abundant increase and glory of future times, the circumstances of shame which attended their early history shall be forgotten. The &lsquo;youth&rsquo; of the Jewish people refers doubtless to the bondage of Egypt, and the trials and calamities which came upon them there. So great should be their future prosperity and glory, that all this should be forgotten.<\/p><p><em>The reproach of thy widowhood<\/em>&mdash;The captivity at Babylon, when they were like a woman bereft of her husband and children (see the notes at <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTg2NTg=\">Isaiah 49:21<\/a>).<\/p>",
