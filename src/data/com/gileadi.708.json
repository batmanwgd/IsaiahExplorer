    "html": "<p>In the same way that Jehovah&rsquo;s people seldom prove loyal to him anciently, so many prove disloyal in the end: &ldquo;Hear, O heavens! Give heed, O earth! Jehovah has spoken: I have reared sons, brought them up, but they have revolted against me&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc2NTciOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 1:2<\/a>); &ldquo;They are a rebellious people, sons who break faith, children unwilling to obey the law of Jehovah&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgyMjciOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 30:9<\/a>). By their rebellions they not only &ldquo;grieve his holy Spirit,&rdquo; they make themselves Jehovah&rsquo;s enemies, hastening his Day of Judgment: &ldquo;Woe to them! I will relieve me of my adversaries, avenge me of my enemies&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc2NzkiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 1:24<\/a>).<\/p>",
