    "html": "<p>Forming an intrinsic part of Babylon&rsquo;s socio-economic structure, Tyre&mdash;like its sister city Sidon (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODMyLDE3ODQyXQ==\">vv 2, 12<\/a>)&mdash;typifies Babylon&rsquo;s shipping and mercantile establishment. Tyre&rsquo;s merchants anciently founded trading colonies throughout the entire known world. Isaiah&rsquo;s concept of a Greater Babylon&mdash;a composite entity that includes a worldwide shipping empire&mdash;informs John&rsquo;s Babylon the Great and its fall, including the demise of Babylon&rsquo;s seafaring enterprise (<a class=\"ref\">Revelation 18:11-24<\/a>). The sirens of Tyre&rsquo;s ships, which sounded joyfully at their departure, now wail at the prospect of having no ports of call.<\/p>",
