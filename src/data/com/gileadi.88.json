Instead of their human knowledge teaching them that next to him they know nothing, they use it to gain acclaim or convert others to their opinion (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3sic2luZ2xlcyI6WzE4MjY2LDE4Njc0XX0seyIxODQ3NCI6M31d\">Isaiah 32:6; 41:22-24; 50:11<\/a>). In response, Jehovah &ldquo;turns wise men about and makes nonsense of their knowledge&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTg1NTk=\">Isaiah 44:25<\/a>). As his Day of Judgment approaches, he performs &ldquo;wonder upon wonder, rendering void the knowledge of their sages and the intelligence of their wise men insignificant&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTgyMDg=\">Isaiah 29:14<\/a>).<\/p>",
