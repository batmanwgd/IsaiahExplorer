The Hebrew noun for the latter word hovers between the meaning of an open place within and one without a city. The context seems in favour of the latter sense. Men weep in the fields because there is no vintage.<\/p>\n <p>All joy is darkened.\u2014The English verb exactly expresses the force of the Hebrew, which is used, as in <a class=\"ref\">Judges 19:9<\/a>, of the gloom of sunset. (Comp. <a class=\"ref\">Micah 3:6<\/a>.) The light of joy had passed into the blackness of darkness.<\/p>",
