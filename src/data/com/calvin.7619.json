    "html": "<p><i>Because thou wast precious. <\/i>Others interpret it \u201cThou wast honorable, because I raised thee to honor;\u201d but I think that God assigns the reason why he gave up Egypt and Ethiopia to the enemies in their room. It was because he loved them, and because they were dear to him. It ought to be explained thus, \u2014 \u201cBecause I loved thee, therefore I gave a man for thee.\u201d By these words he excludes all personal worth on the part of the people, that they may not boast of having obtained anything by their own merit; and, indeed, the cause of salvation, and of all the blessings which we receive, is the undeserved love of God; it is also the cause of all our excellence; for, if he judge of us according to our own qualifications, he will not value us a straw. We must therefore set aside every idea of merit, or of personal worth, of which we have none, and must ascribe everything to the grace of God alone. He means that this love is not of an ordinary kind when he says that we are \u201cprecious;\u201d and for the same reason he calls us \u201chis first-born,\u201d (<a class=\"ref\">Exodus 4:22<\/a>,) and \u201chis friends.\u201d (<a class=\"ref\">John 15:15<\/a>.) <\/p>\n<p><i>I will give a man. <\/i>Here he adds nothing new, but rather explains the preceding statement, and employs the word \u201cman\u201d collectively for \u201cmen;\u201d as if he had said, \u201cThere will be no man whom God will not take away and destroy, in order to preserve his people; for he sets a higher value on a single believer than on the whole world.\u201d At the same time he reminds believers that they are redeemed at the expense of those who do not at all differ from them in origin or in nature. <\/p>",
