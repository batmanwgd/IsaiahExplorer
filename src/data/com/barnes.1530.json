    "html": "<p><em>And Lebanon<\/em>&mdash;The expression here refers to the trees or the cedars of Lebanon. Thus it is rendered by the Chaldee: &lsquo;And the trees of Lebanon.&rsquo; For a description of Lebanon, see the note at <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc4ODUiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 10:34<\/a>. It is probable that the word Lebanon here is not used in the limited sense in which it is sometimes employed, to denote a single mountain, or a single range of mountains, but includes the entire ranges lying north of Palestine, and which were comprehended under the general name of Libanus. The idea here is, that all these ranges of mountains, abounding in magnificent trees and forests, would not furnish fuel sufficient to burn the sacrifices which would be an appropriate offering to the majesty and glory of God.<\/p><p><em>To burn<\/em>&mdash;To burn for the purpose of consuming the sacrifice.<\/p><p>Nor the beasts thereof for a burnt-offering&mdash;As the mountains of Lebanon were extensive forests, they would abound with wild animals. The idea is, that all those animals, if offered in sacrifice, would not be an appropriate expression of what was due to God. It may be remarked here, if all the vast forests of Lebanon on fire, and all its animals consumed as an offering to God, were not sufficient to show forth his glory, how little can our praises express the proper sense of his majesty and honor! How profound should be our reverence for God! With what awful veneration should we come before him! The image employed here by Isaiah is one of great poetic beauty; and nothing, perhaps, could give a deeper impression of the majesty and honor of the great Yahweh.<\/p>",
