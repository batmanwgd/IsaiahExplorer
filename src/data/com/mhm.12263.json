That ruin is  here, in this chapter, largely foretold, not to gratify a spirit of  revenge in the people of God, who had been used barbarously by them,  but to encourage their faith and hope concerning their own deliverance,  and to be a type of the downfall of that great enemy of the  New-Testament church which, in the Revelation, goes under the name of  \"Babylon.\" In this chapter we have,  I. The greatness of the ruin threatened, that Babylon should be brought  down to the dust, and made completely miserable, should fall from the  height of prosperity into the depth of adversity,   <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 47:1-5<\/a>.  II. The sins that provoked God to bring this ruin upon them.  1. Their cruelty to the people of God,   <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTg2MDY=\">Isaiah 47:6<\/a>.  2. Their pride and carnal security,   <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 47:7-9<\/a>.  3. Their confidence in themselves and contempt of God,   <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTg2MTA=\">Isaiah 47:10<\/a>.  4. Their use of magic arts and their dependence upon enchantments and  sorceries, which should be so far from standing them in any stead that  they should but hasten their ruin,   <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 47:11-15<\/a>.<\/p>",
