Hebrew. <i>nazah<\/i>. When used of liquids it means to spurt out, as in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTg4NzA=\">Isaiah 63:3<\/a>, the only other occurrence in Isaiah, and that in judgment (compare <a class=\"ref\">2 Kings 9:33<\/a>). The usual word for ceremonial sprinkling is <i>zrak<\/i>, not <i>nazah<\/i>. The astonishment and the joy of many nations is set in contrast with the astonishment of the many people of <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTg3MTE=\">Isaiah 52:14<\/a>. The Septuagint reads <em>\"shall admire\"<\/em>. Moreover, the verb is in the Hiphil conjugation, and we can say \"cause to leap up for joy\", but not \"cause to sprinkle\". With this, Gesenius, Fuerst, Lowth, Parkhurst, and others agree. <\/p>\n\n<p><em>shut their mouths:<\/em> i.e. be dumb with the astonishment. <\/p>\n\n<p><em>that which had, &c.<\/em> = they to whom it had been told shall see. <\/p>\n\n<p><em>that which they, &c.<\/em> = they which had not heard shall consider.
