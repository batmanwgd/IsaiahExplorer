The fact to be recorded was, that they were rebellious <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgyMjciOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 30:9<\/a> ; the design for which the record was to be made was to show to future times that this had been the uniform character of the nation. The record was to be preserved that it might be a proof of the care of God toward the nation even in the midst of their long-continued and obstinate perverseness.<\/p><p><em>Write it before them<\/em>&mdash;Before the Jews themselves, that they may see the record, and may have it constantly before them.<\/p><p><em>In a table<\/em>&mdash;Or ON a table.
