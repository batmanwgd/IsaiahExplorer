I said, Behold me, behold me <\/i>\u2014 I invited whole nations, by the preaching of my gospel, to <i>behold me, <\/i>and that with importunity, reiterating my calls and entreaties; and this I did unto a <i>nation not called by my name, <\/i>with which I was not in covenant, and which did not profess any relation to me. The prophet speaks of what was to take place some hundreds of years afterward, as if it were a thing already done, to signify the certainty of it.<\/p>",
