    "html": "<p>Although Isaiah is already in a state of mourning because of the wickedness of Jehovah&rsquo;s people and Assyria&rsquo;s aggressiveness, Jehovah now asks him to go naked and barefoot as a &ldquo;sign and portent&rdquo; against Egypt and Cush (cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTc4MjY=\">Isaiah 8:18<\/a>). Exposing himself to the elements and to people&rsquo;s mockery, Isaiah&mdash;&ldquo;my servant&rdquo;&mdash;obeys. As a type of Jehovah&rsquo;s end-time servant, Isaiah gives warning of Assyria&rsquo;s invasion of Egypt and Cush (Upper Egypt) and of the humiliation of their captives. They have three years in which to repent before three years of Jehovah&rsquo;s Day of Judgment overtake them (cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTc5ODQ=\">Isaiah 16:14<\/a>).<\/p>",
