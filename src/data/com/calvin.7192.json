    "html": "<p><i>Turning he will turn thee. <\/i> Isaiah continues the same discourse, in which he ridiculed the pride of Shebna, who had bestowed so much cost on building a sepulcher. This statement is connected with the first clause of the former verse; for, as he formerly said \u201cHe will remove thee by an extraordinary removal,\u201d so he now says, \u201cHe will toss thee as a ball into an open plain.\u201d By this comparison he means that nothing will prevent the Lord from casting him out into a distant country, though he thinks that his power is firmly established; and since he had been so careful about his sepulcher, and had given orders about it, as if he had been certain as to his death, Isaiah declares that he will not die in Jerusalem, but in a foreign country, to which he shall be banished. <\/p>\n<p><i>The chariot of thy glory. <\/i>Under the word <i>chariot <\/i>he includes all the fame and rank of Shebna; as if he had said that disgrace would be his reputation among foreigners. Thus, the Lord ridicules the mad ambition of those who look at nothing but the world, and who judge of their happiness by the glory of fading and transitory objects. <\/p>\n<p><i>The shame of thy lord\u2019s house. <\/i>He calls it \u201cthe shame of\u201d the royal \u201chouse,\u201d either because he had polluted that holy place which might be regarded as the sanctuary of the Lord, or because Hezekiah had judged ill in elevating him to that station. That the mask of his high rank might not screen him from this prediction, the Prophet expressly states, that the office which he holds aggravates his guilt and renders him more detestable. Let princes, therefore, if they do not wish to expose themselves and their houses to reproaches, learn to act with judgment in appointing men to hold office. <\/p>",
