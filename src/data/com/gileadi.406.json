    "html": "<p>While Jerusalem isn&rsquo;t among the cities of Judea that Sennacherib captures, he does send his commander Rabshakeh with 185,000 men to Jerusalem to demand the city&rsquo;s surrender. Meanwhile, Sennacherib himself lays siege to the fortress city of Lachish and destroys it. The place where Rabshakeh takes up his position turns out to be where Isaiah had earlier predicted that very outcome to King Ahaz: &ldquo;Then Jehovah said to Isaiah, &lsquo;Go out and meet Ahaz, you and your son Shear-Jashub, at the end of the aqueduct of the Upper Reservoir, on the road to the Laundry Plaza&rsquo;&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTc3ODY=\">Isaiah 7:3<\/a>; cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">7:14-25<\/a>).<\/p>",
