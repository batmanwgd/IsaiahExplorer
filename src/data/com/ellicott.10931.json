It was the \u201cspirit of the Lord\u201d that had made men true heroes and judges in the days of old (<a class=\"ref\">Judges 11:29; Judges 13:25<\/a>). It was in the \u201cspirit of the Lord\u201d descending on Jesus of Nazareth and abiding on Him (<a class=\"ref\">John 1:33<\/a>) that men were taught to see the token that He was the Christ of God. And in this case the spirit was to give more than the heroic daring which had characterised Jephthah and Samson. The future King was to be as a David and Solomon in one, pre-eminent, chiefly, as the Prince of Peace (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTc4Mzc=\">Isaiah 9:7<\/a>), in the wisdom and counsel which had been the glory of the latter. \u201cWisdom,\u201d in its highest form, as implying the comprehension of the secret things of God; \u201cunderstanding,\u201d as the sagacity which discerned the right thing to do and the right word to say (<a class=\"ref\">Hebrews 5:14<\/a>) in all human relationships; these formed the first link in the chain of supernatural gifts. With these there was to be the \u201cspirit of counsel and might,\u201d the clear purpose and strength which fits a king for the right exercise of sovereignty; and lastly, as at once the crown and source of all, the \u201cspirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord,\u201d the reverence and faith which is \u201cthe beginning of all wisdom\u201d (<a class=\"ref\">Proverbs 1:7<\/a>). The copious use of the vocabulary of the Book of Proverbs is interesting as showing the part which that book played in the prophet\u2019s education. (See Introduction.)<\/p>",
