Nor can it be doubted that he calls to their remembrance, that when their fathers were threatened with death in the wilderness through a scarcity of bread and of every kind of food, God gave them daily, for forty years, manna from heaven. (<a class=\"ref\">Exodus 16:35<\/a>.) In like manner, when he immediately afterwards speaks of a shadow against <i>the heat of the sun, <\/i>he alludes to the history related by Moses about \u201cthe pillar of a cloud,\u201d by which God protected his people from being scorched by the buming rays of the sun. (<a class=\"ref\">Exodus 13:21<\/a>.) We have said that it is customary with the prophets to mention the departure of the people out of Egypt, whenever they intend to demonstrate the kindness of God, either publicly towards all, or privately towards any individual. <\/p>\n<p><i>By the fountains of waters. <\/i>He likewise alludes to those waters which flowed from the rock, (<a class=\"ref\">Exodus 17:6<\/a>,) when the people had well-nigh perished from thirst; for those occurrences did not take place at the deliverance from Babylon, but, by mentioning former benefits, the Prophet magnifies the power of God in securing the safety of the Church. <\/p>",
