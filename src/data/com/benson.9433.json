In judgment I will remember mercy. It must be observed, that silver is the most difficult to be refined, and requires a hotter and clearer fire than gold and other metals. <i>I have chosen thee in the furnace of affliction <\/i>\u2014 I have taken this method to purge thee from thy dross, and render thee a chosen people to myself. <i>For mine own sake will I do it <\/i>\u2014 Namely, this great work of delivering my people out of Babylon. <i>For how should my name be polluted <\/i>\u2014 If I should not deliver my people, my name would be profaned and blasphemed, as if I were either impotent, or implacable to them. <i>I will not give my glory unto another <\/i>\u2014 I will not give any colour to idolaters, to ascribe the divine nature and properties to idols, as they would do if I did not rescue my people out of their hands, in spite of their idols.<\/p>",
