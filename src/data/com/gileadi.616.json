    "html": "<p>While the Masoretic Text says, &ldquo;Among the wicked was his burial, and among the rich his death,&rdquo; <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">verse 9<\/a>&rsquo;s parallel features suggest the opposite. Because violence is typical of the wicked and deceit of the rich, not vice versa, and because a person dies before he is buried, not vice versa, the MT version appears corrupt. That the person is innocent, moreover, reaffirms that he dies on account of others&rsquo; guilt, not his own. And as ascent follows descent, Jehovah&rsquo;s elect&rsquo;s rising from the dust in Isaiah&rsquo;s Servant-Tyrant Parallelism (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 52:1-2<\/a>) establishes the pattern for Jehovah&rsquo;s rising from the dust.<\/p>",
