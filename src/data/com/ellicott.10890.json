The picture of the conquerors collecting the spoil is continued from <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTc4MzM=\">Isaiah 9:3<\/a>. The victory is decisive, and the reign of peace begins, and the weapons of war, the garments red with blood (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODg2OCI6M30=\">Isaiah 63:1-3<\/a>), the heavy boot that makes the earth ring with the warrior\u2019s tread, these shall all be burnt up. Like pictures of a time of peace are found in <a class=\"ref\">Zechariah 9:10<\/a>; Ezek. xxxix, 9; <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 46:9; Psalms 76:3<\/a>.<\/p>",
