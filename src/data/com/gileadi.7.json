    "html": "<p><em>The Daughter of Zion.<\/em> When defining Israel&rsquo;s relationship to its God, the Hebrew prophets commonly characterize Israel as a woman and Jehovah as her husband within the marriage covenant. Because Jehovah&rsquo;s people as a whole have apostatized, however, persons among them who survive Assyria&rsquo;s destruction comprise but a small remnant of Jehovah&rsquo;s people. Called &ldquo;Zion&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Daughter of Zion&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4Mzc1LDE4Njk5LDE4ODY2XQ==\">Isaiah 37:22; 52:2; 62:11<\/a>), these survivors represent a higher spiritual category of Jehovah&rsquo;s people than the &ldquo;Israel&rdquo; category because of their faithfulness to his covenant through many trials.<\/p><p><em>The Daughter of Zion is left.<\/em> The idea of being &ldquo;left&rdquo; signifies the survival of a remnant of Jehovah&rsquo;s people at the time the rest perish. It underscores the dire conditions under which some survive. Word links in the Book of Isaiah identify those who are &ldquo;left&rdquo; as persons who return from exile in a new exodus to Zion (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODk2LDE3OTAxXQ==\">Isaiah 11:11, 16<\/a>), who survive Assyria&rsquo;s siege of Jerusalem (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTgzNTc=\">Isaiah 37:4<\/a>), who remain &ldquo;as a flagstaff on a mountaintop, an ensign on a hill&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTgyMzU=\">Isaiah 30:17<\/a>), whose names are &ldquo;inscribed among the living at Jerusalem&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTc3Mzc=\">Isaiah 4:3<\/a>), and who are called &ldquo;the holy offspring&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTc3ODM=\">Isaiah 6:13<\/a>).<\/p><p><em>A shelter in a vineyard.<\/em> While Jehovah&rsquo;s &ldquo;vineyard&rdquo; denotes the Promised Land (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 5:1-7<\/a>), in the millennial age it extends to the entire earth (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 27:2-6<\/a>). The &ldquo;shelter&rdquo; refers to Jehovah&rsquo;s cloud of glory that protects a remnant of his people as it did ancient Israel (<a class=\"ref\">Exodus 14:19-20, Exodus 14:19-20, 24<\/a>): &ldquo;Over the whole site of Mount Zion, and over its solemn assembly, Jehovah will form a cloud by day and a mist glowing with fire by night: above all that is glorious shall be a canopy. It shall be a shelter and shade from the heat of the day, a secret refuge from the downpour and from rain&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 4:5-6<\/a>; cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">25:4-5<\/a>).<\/p><p><em>A hut in a melon field.<\/em> The idea of a &ldquo;hut&rdquo; suggests the presence of a watchman who guards the field against thieves and wild animals. A synonym of the term &ldquo;shelter&rdquo;&mdash;which appears in parallel with it&mdash;the &ldquo;hut&rdquo; further connotes protection from the elements, such as a rainstorm or the heat of the sun, whose imagery alludes to Jehovah&rsquo;s Day of Judgment (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3sic2luZ2xlcyI6WzE3OTk3LDE4MTY3LDE4Mjc5LDE4NDQ1LDE4NjQ3XX0seyIxODAwMiI6M30seyIxODEyMyI6Mn0seyIxODE3OSI6Nn1d\">Isaiah 17:13; 18:4-6; 25:4-5; 28:2, 14-19; 32:19; 40:24; 49:10<\/a>). As a watchman&rsquo;s role includes sounding the alarm when danger approaches (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 21:6-10<\/a>), so those who heed the watchman&rsquo;s warning are persons most likely to survive.<\/p><p><em>A city under siege.<\/em> The &ldquo;city&rdquo; motif&mdash;which here appears in parallel with the &ldquo;shelter&rdquo; and &ldquo;hut&rdquo;&mdash;provides another metaphor of Jehovah&rsquo;s people. Ultimately there emerge <em>two<\/em> cities in the Book of Isaiah that represent Jehovah&rsquo;s covenant people: one wicked, the other righteous; one destroyed, the other delivered (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3sic2luZ2xlcyI6WzE4MzAwLDE4OTI5XX0seyIxODEwNiI6M30seyIxODEzMiI6Nn0seyIxODY5OCI6Mn1d\">v 21; Isaiah 24:10-12; 26:1-6; 33:20; 52:1-2; 66:6<\/a>). The expression &ldquo;under siege&rdquo; (<em>nesurah<\/em>), moreover, possesses a double meaning in Hebrew: (1) &ldquo;under siege&rdquo;; and (2) &ldquo;preserved.&rdquo; In other words, although the righteous city may come under siege by enemies, Jehovah preserves it.<\/p>",
