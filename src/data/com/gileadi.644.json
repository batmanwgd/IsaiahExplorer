    "html": "<p>As Jehovah&rsquo;s Day of Judgment approaches, the wickedness of the wicked and the righteousness of the righteous increase exponentially, ultimately dividing not only Jehovah&rsquo;s people but the entire world. The anonymous &ldquo;you&rdquo; refers to those who have become so alienated from Jehovah as to no longer qualify being identified as his people (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3OTE4LDE4ODgzLDE4ODg2XQ==\">v 11; Isaiah 63:16, 19<\/a>). The term &ldquo;sorceress&rdquo; attest to the activities of a satanic cult within Jehovah&rsquo;s people that is characterized by its devotees&rsquo; spiritual and physical adultery as their apostasy and perversity reach their zenith (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3sic2luZ2xlcyI6WzE3Njg0LDE4OTQwXX0seyIxODkwMCI6Nn1d\">Isaiah 1:29; 65:2-7; 66:17<\/a>).<\/p><p>As evil speaking and persecution characterize the wicked not the righteous, so the wicked compulsively oppress the righteous. Using them as scapegoats (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODUxLDE4OTI4XQ==\">Isaiah 61:7; 66:5<\/a>; cf. <a class=\"ref\">Matthew 5:10-12; 23:33-34; John 15:20-21; Revelation 12:13<\/a>), they even justify themselves that by tyrannizing them they do God a service (<a class=\"ref\">John 15:18-21; 16:2<\/a>). In all respects, the wicked emulate their exemplar&mdash;the king of Assyria\/Babylon&mdash;the <em>mouth<\/em> that mouths off against Jehovah and his people and the <em>tongue<\/em> that accuses them (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc3MTYiOjJ9LHsiMTgzNzYiOjJ9LHsiMTgzODEiOjJ9LHsiMTg3NDAiOjJ9XQ==\">Isaiah 3:8-9; 37:23-24, 28-29; 54:16-17<\/a>; cf. <a class=\"ref\">Daniel 7:8, 11, 20-26; Revelation 13:3-8<\/a>).<\/p>",
