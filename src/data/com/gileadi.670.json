    "html": "<p>As the consequences of transgression set in and those who oppressed others are now themselves oppressed, the full weight of their misdeeds hits home. Because there was no &ldquo;redress&rdquo; or &lsquo;justice&rdquo; (<em>mispat<\/em>) for those whom they wronged, there now exists none for them. Because their righteousness before God was self-righteousness, <em>righteousness<\/em>&mdash;Jehovah&rsquo;s servant&mdash;led away the righteous from among them (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg3OTUiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 58:8<\/a>). As even those who now repent and stand up for the truth are themselves victimized, in such an adversarial climate integrity or uprightness stands little chance of being restored.<\/p>",
