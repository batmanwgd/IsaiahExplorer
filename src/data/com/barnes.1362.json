    "html": "<p><em>Rise up...<\/em>&mdash;Rosenmuller supposes that this commences a new vision or prophecy; and that the former part <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 32:9-14<\/a> refers to the desolation of Judea by the invasion of Sennacherib, and the latter <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 32:15-20<\/a> to the prosperity which would succeed that invasion. It cannot be doubted that this is the general reference of the passage, but there does not seem to be a necessity of making a division here. The entire prophecy, including the whole chapter, relates in general to the reign of Hezekiah; and as these events were to occur during his reign, the prophet groups them together, and presents them as constituting important events in his reign. The general design of this portion of the prophecy <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 32:9-14<\/a> is to show the desolation that would come upon the land of Judea in consequence of that invasion. This he represents in a poetical manner, by calling on the daughters of fashion and ease to arouse, since all their comforts were to be taken away.<\/p><p><em>Ye women that are at ease<\/em>&mdash;They who are surrounded by the comforts which affluence gives, and that have no fear of being reduced to wang (compare <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 3:16-26<\/a>).<\/p><p><em>Ye careless daughters<\/em>&mdash;Hebrew, &lsquo;Daughters confiding;&rsquo; that is, those who felt no alarm, and who did not regard God and his threatenings.<\/p>",
