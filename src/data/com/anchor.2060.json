    "html": "<p>The initial v <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc2NTYiOjMxfV0=\">23a<\/a> (&ldquo;there is no gloom for her who is oppressed&rdquo;) links with the end of the Memoir and prepares for a reversal of fortune after the dark scenario of <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc4MjkiOjJ9XQ==\">8:21&ndash;22<\/a>, in which respect it duplicates the editorial procedure of juxtaposing a promise of redemption with disaster, as in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc3MzYiOjV9XQ==\">4:2&ndash;6<\/a> following <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc2OTIiOjQ0fV0=\">2:6&ndash;4:1<\/a>. The feminine suffix is not explained. It may anticipate the poem, with reference to Judah or Jerusalem at a critical period of its history, not necessarily the immediate post-586 b.c.e. period (pace Clements, 1980a 105), or it could refer to the mother of the son whose birth is celebrated. To understand the sudden reversal back to diatribe at the end of the poem (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc4MzciOjF9XQ==\">9:7[8]&ndash;10:4<\/a>) would require us to unravel the complicated editorial history of this section, no easy task. One possibility is that, since <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc4NzUiOjR9XQ==\">10:24&ndash;27a<\/a> uses the language and themes of the &ldquo;new ruler, new age&rdquo; poem (yoke, bar, rod, burden placed on the shoulders, defeat of Midian), it may at one time have followed directly after it. With regard to background and date, it would be prudent to consider the poem independently of its prose introduction (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">8:23b<\/a>). The latter refers to two phases of military disaster for parts of the Kingdom of Samaria. The second of these phases almost certainly alludes to the annexation of Israelite territory during Tiglath-pileser&rsquo;s campaign of 732 b.c.e. resulting in the formation of the Assyrian provinces of Duru (Dor, &ldquo;the way of the sea&rdquo;), Gal\u02bfazu (Gilead, &ldquo;the land across the Jordan&rdquo;) and Magidu (Megiddo, &ldquo;Galilee of the nations&rdquo;). If this is so, the &ldquo;later one&rdquo; would be Tiglath-pileser III himself (<a class=\"ref\">2 Kgs 15:29<\/a>). The earlier phase affected the tribal territory of Zebulon and Naphthali, i.e., Upper Galilee and the Golan, the arena of Syrian-Israelite struggle throughout the ninth and a good part of the eighth century, which would suggest identifying &ldquo;the earlier ruler&rdquo; with a Syrian, either Hazael or Ben-Hadad (Bir-Hadad III) (as also Eshel). This would seem to be preferable to a more traditional line of interpretation identifying the oppressors as Tiglath-pileser III and Shalmaneser V (as Calvin and, implicitly, Ibn Ezra), since there is no allusion here to the fall of the Northern Kingdom in 722 b.c.e. At any rate, the choice of verbs suggests foreign oppression of these regions rather than an identification with native rulers, either Jeroboam II and Menahem (Hayes and Irvine 1987, 176&ndash;79) or Pekah and Hoshea (Ginsberg; Emerton).<\/p><p>On the assumption that the poem begins at <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc4MzEiOjF9XQ==\">9:1[2]<\/a> (pace Alt 1964b, 211&ndash;12), we must first ask whether the poem and the introductory historical note belong together, either as originally one composition or in the sense that the poem, whenever composed, was written to announce the reversal of the condition described in the note, either as an event that has already taken place or as an aspiration for the future. To answer this question we have to address the issue of the time and circumstances of the composition of the poem. Several exegetes have argued for a postexilic date (e.g. Gray, Fohrer, Lescow) and, in keeping with his overall treatment of these chapters, Kaiser (1972, 203&ndash;18) associates it with messianic movements during the Persian period and more specifically with the Levitical musicians&rsquo; guilds, which he believes were the custodians of the traditional royal liturgy. If we compare it with texts known to be postexilic that focus on the Davidic dynasty we certainly note some duplication of themes, e.g, the throne of David (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc5NzUiOjF9XQ==\">Isa 16:5<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\">Jer 17:25; 22:2, 4; 33:17, 21<\/a>), the giving of a name (<a class=\"ref\">Jer 23:6<\/a>), the breaking of a foreign yoke (<a class=\"ref\">Jer 30:8&ndash;9<\/a>), the establishment of justice and righteousness (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc5NzUiOjF9XQ==\">Isa 16:5<\/a>;<a class=\"ref\"> Jer 23:5; 33:15<\/a>), reunification of the two kingdoms (<a class=\"ref\">Jer 33:24; Hos 2:1&ndash;3; 3:5<\/a>), but nonetheless the differences are more in evidence than the similarities. Furthermore, the poem says nothing about a future <em>restoration<\/em> of the dynasty and does not fit well with what we know about the religious and intellectual life of the Judean community in the sixth and fifth centuries b.c.e. (Mowinckel 1959, 102&ndash;10; Clements 1980a, 104; Wildberger 1991, 389&ndash;93).<\/p><p>On the assumption, then, that the one who is given those auspicious names is an actual historical ruler rather than a projection of hopes for the future after the monarchy had passed from the scene, it remains to be asked to whom the poem refers and whether it celebrates a birth or accession to the throne. Many have followed Alt and von Rad in explaining the language of the poem against the background of Egyptian rituals accompanying the accession of a new pharaoh and including the conferring of throne names, generally five in number. There is, however, a problem of <em>form<\/em>, in that in such rituals the deity addresses the ruler-designate directly (as in <a class=\"ref\">2 Sam 7:14 and Ps 2:7<\/a>) and does so in terms of divine, adoptive sonship, neither of which is the case in the poem (pace von Rad 1958, 230&ndash;31). Moreover, only four names are conferred on the son in the poem, and none of the numerous attempts to conjure a fifth name out of v <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc2NTYiOjMxfV0=\">6[7]<\/a> has been especially persuasive. It may also be relevant to recall that the death of Ahaz is noted only at a later point in the book (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc5NTciOjF9XQ==\">14:28<\/a>). If, then, we take the poem at face value as speaking of a royal birth, which in the ancient as in the modern world is a natural occasion for celebration and renewal, we would like to know whose birth it is celebrating. Though full of vivid imagery, the language is unspecific enough to have permitted the poem to be recycled on successive occasions, a point generally overlooked by the proponents of this or that ruler. It may well have been used or re used at the time of Josiah (Barth 1977, 141&ndash;77 especially 176&ndash;77; Vermeylen 1989, 232&ndash;49), but aspirations for reunion probably did not originate during that reign, and we have to ask why a poet writing in the second half of the seventh century would limit the geographical perspective to territory annexed by the Assyrians in 733 rather than taking in the entire Kingdom of Samaria. Nothing can be deduced from the description of a victory of epic proportions (vv<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc3MDkiOjMyfV0=\"> 3&ndash;4[4&ndash;5]<\/a>) either, since nothing of that nature happened at either the birth or the accession of Josiah (648 and 640 b.c.e., respectively). The language imitates the oratorical and declamatory style of the court and corresponds to aspiration rather than political and military reality. Since, after what has been said about him to date we can scarcely suppose the poet is referring to Ahaz (as argued by Hayes and Irvine 1987, 176&ndash;84), the only remaining candidate would be Hezekiah. If this is so, Hezekiah would have been born ca. 734&ndash;732, his accession to the throne would have been ca. 715, therefore in his late teens rather than at twenty-five years old (as <a class=\"ref\">2 Kgs 18:2<\/a>), and the fourteenth year of his reign, 701 b.c.e. Needless to say, this does not determine the date of composition. Duhm (1892, 88&ndash;89), for example, proposed a date subsequent to the invasion of Sennacherib, adding the excellent suggestion that it may have served as a counterpart to the scenario of defeat and devastation in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc2NjAiOjV9XQ==\">1:5&ndash;9<\/a> corresponding to the disaster of 701 b.c.e. An original reference to Hezekiah seems, then, to be the most likely hypothesis and has the advantage of aligning the poem more closely with the preceding material, including the birth of the child called Immanuel (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc3OTciOjF9XQ==\">7:14<\/a>).<\/p><p>The poem is often compared with the thanksgiving psalms (e.g. <a class=\"ref\">Ps 18; 23; 107<\/a>), but in reality has little in common with them. These psalms address God directly, but in the poem direct address of this kind occurs only in vv <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc2ODciOjQ4fV0=\">2&ndash;3[3&ndash;4]<\/a>. Commentators divide it into strophes (Duhm, 1892, 88, has four) and spell out its meter, but no two solutions are identical. Perhaps all we can say for sure is that it is in an irregularly distributed <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc3MDkiOjI2fSx7IjE3Njg3IjoyMn1d\">3&ndash;3, 2&ndash;2<\/a> pattern, normal for Isaian rhetoric. It opens with the sudden transition from the land of gloom, figurative language for the underworld (cf. <a class=\"ref\">Job 10:21&ndash;22<\/a> <em>\u02beere\u1e63 \u1e25\u014d&scaron;ek v\u0115\u1e63alm\u0101vet<\/em>, the &ldquo;land of darkness and gloom&rdquo;) to a place of brilliant light. &ldquo;Light&rdquo; (<em>\u02be&ocirc;r<\/em>), and the passage from darkness to light, are dominant images in all sections of Isaiah (see especially <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg4MjMiOjJ9XQ==\">60:1&ndash;2<\/a>); the rest of the poem serves to explicate what this means, but the explication is delayed while the poet describes public rejoicing under the familiar images of harvesting and sharing the spoil after victory. This last suggests a further delay, while oppressive foreign rule is presented under all-too-familiar and related images of servitude: the yoke placed on the neck (<em>\u02bf\u014dl<\/em> cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc4NzgiOjF9LHsiMTc5NTQiOjF9XQ==\">10:27; 14:25<\/a>), the bar used either to strike or pinion the shoulders (<em>ma\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0113h<\/em> cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc4NzUiOjF9XQ==\">10:24<\/a>), the rod for beating prisoners into subjection (<em>&scaron;\u0113be\u1e6d<\/em> cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc4NzUiOjF9XQ==\">10:24<\/a>) and as a symbol of dominance in general (cf. <a class=\"ref\">Gen 49:10<\/a>; <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc5MzQiOjF9XQ==\">Isa 14:5<\/a>). All of these are to be done away with, and the scene closes with the image of the stripping of the dead and incinerating of their bloodstained belongings.<\/p><p>Allusion to the defeat of the Midianites was no doubt suggested by the divine intervention that decided the issue, especially miraculous in view of the disparity in numbers once Gideon&rsquo;s army was reduced from 32,000 to 300 (<a class=\"ref\">Judg 6&ndash;7<\/a>). It serves to remind us how seldom the Isaiah tradition, especially in its earlier stages, appeals to what became the normative historical traditions of Israel. No casual allusion to the ancestors (Abraham is referred to only in postexilic passages, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgyMTYiOjF9LHsiMTg0NjAiOjF9LHsiMTg2NzYiOjF9XQ==\">29:22; 41:8; 51:2<\/a>) or to the exodus, wilderness, and occupation of Canaan appears; nothing except the Cities of the Plain (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc2NjQiOjJ9LHsiMTc3MTciOjF9LHsiMTc5MjYiOjF9XQ==\">1:9&ndash;10; 3:9; 13:19<\/a>), a tradition that we know to have arisen independently of its context in the Abraham story.<\/p><p>The eschatological horizon of the abolition of war is a major theme in the tradition of which Isaiah is the chief representative. We heard earlier of the beating of swords into plowshares, a now familiar image of the transfer of resources from military-industrial to domestic-civic use (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc2OTAiOjF9XQ==\">2:4<\/a>), and the theme of disarmament will be expressed more clearly in the related messianic poem in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc4OTEiOjR9XQ==\">11:6&ndash;9<\/a>. This leads directly to the <em>peripateia<\/em>, the hinge on which the poem turns, the birth of the marvelous child. We now have the key to understanding what has been said so far and realize that it was said in the prophetic perfect tense&mdash;i.e., these results that have not yet come about are assured now that the child is born; the birth of the heir to the throne is the necessary condition for these great events to unfold. Whether the sequel to the birth corresponds to ceremonies carried out in the palace on this occasion&mdash;a ritual of investiture and the conferring of throne names&mdash;we do not know but may consider quite likely. &ldquo;Emblems of sovereignty,&rdquo; an attempt to render <em>mi\u015br&acirc;<\/em>, which occurs only here, may point to investiture with a robe or other symbol of authority, cf. the &ldquo;key of the house of David&rdquo; placed on the shoulder of Eliakim when appointed majordomo of the palace (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgwNzUiOjF9XQ==\">22:22<\/a>). The names <em>may<\/em> carry an echo of Egyptian practice, though we have seen that these names differ from the pharaonic throne names both in type and number. What is certain is that they continue the practice in the Memoir of conferring symbolic names or titles on the protagonists, another indication that the poem is more fully integrated into this first section of the book than is commonly acknowledged.<\/p><p>A brief note on the four throne names will suffice. They express important aspects of an ideal polity and government, which was certainly never realized in ancient Israel and, at the same time, intimate a certain transcendental aura attaching to royalty in the ancient Near East. The designation <em>pele\u02be y&ocirc;\u02bf\u0113\u1e63<\/em> (&ldquo;Marvelous Counselor&rdquo;), a juxtaposition of two words syntactically unrelated, indicates the capacity to elaborate good plans and stratagems, an attribute of Yahveh according to Isaiah (cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc3NTkiOjJ9XQ==\">5:19 and 25:1<\/a> <em>pele\u02be \u02bf\u0113\u1e63&ocirc;t<\/em>, &ldquo;miraculous plans&rdquo;). The title <em>\u02be\u0113l gibb&ocirc;r<\/em>, literally, &ldquo;God warrior,&rdquo; is not an example of the superlative formed with <em>\u02be\u0113l<\/em>, which would require the reverse order of words (as in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc5NDIiOjF9XQ==\">14:13<\/a> <em>k&ocirc;k\u0115b&ecirc;-\u02be\u0113l<\/em>, &ldquo;mighty stars&rdquo;), but is a divine title applied to the ruler, as can be seen from its reuse by a later interpreter in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc4NzIiOjF9XQ==\">10:21<\/a> &ldquo;a remnant will return (Shearyashub), the remnant (<em>&scaron;\u0115\u02be\u0101r<\/em>) of Jacob to <em>\u02be\u0113l gibb&ocirc;r<\/em>&rdquo;; a parallel therefore to the same theophoric element in the name Immanu-el, &ldquo;El is with us&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc3OTciOjF9LHsiMTc4MTYiOjJ9XQ==\">7:14; 8:8, 10<\/a>). Finally, <em>\u02be\u0103b&icirc;\u02bfad<\/em>, &ldquo;Eternal Father,&rdquo; is a rare but not unattested formation (cf. Hab <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc3MTQiOjF9XQ==\">3:6<\/a> <em>har\u0115r&ecirc;-\u02bfad<\/em>, &ldquo;eternal mountains&rdquo;). It would be too literal-minded to suppose that the title is incongruous when assigned to a newborn child; the child will one day be ruler, and the ruler&rsquo;s task is to foster or &ldquo;father&rdquo; his people; there is also the conventional attribution of &ldquo;eternal life&rdquo; to the ruler (e.g. <a class=\"ref\">Ps 72:5, 17<\/a>). The most familiar of these titles is the last, <em>\u015bar &scaron;\u0101l&ocirc;m<\/em>, &ldquo;Prince of Peace,&rdquo; used as a messianic designation by both Christians and Jews (the Targum paraphrases &ldquo;Messiah in whose days peace will be great for us&rdquo;). The term <em>&scaron;\u0101l&ocirc;m<\/em> signifies more than the absence of hostilities, though that is its essential precondition, for it is also associated with public order founded on justice and righteousness. Peace is what happens when a righteous order prevails (<em>ma\u02bf\u0103\u015b\u0113h ha\u1e63\u1e63\u0115d\u0101q&acirc;<\/em>, <a class=\"ref\">Isa 32:17<\/a>), and it is the task of governments royal or otherwise to establish it.<\/p><p>This point linking up the exercise of political power, the preservation of peace, and the establishment of a just order is made in the final three verses (v <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc2NTYiOjMxfV0=\">6a[7a]<\/a>) from which, as noted earlier, we should probably not try to extract a fifth title (as, for example, <em>marb\u0113h hammi\u015br&acirc;<\/em>, &ldquo;Increaser of Sovereignty,&rdquo; Alt 1964b, 219). The final line, attributing this reversal of fortune to the zeal or passion (<em>q&icirc;n\u02be&acirc;<\/em>) of Yahveh of the hosts, occurs in another anti-Assyrian context in the Isaian &ldquo;legend&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgzODUiOjF9XQ==\">37:32<\/a>) and has been added to the poem, perhaps, after all the exalted language about the ruler-designate, to dispel any doubt about the ultimate source of these great happenings.<\/p><p> Blenkinsopp, J.
