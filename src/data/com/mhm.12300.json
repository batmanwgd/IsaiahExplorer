A solemn charge given to us all to make conscience of our duty, as  we hope to have the benefit of those promises,   <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTg3NTU=\">Isaiah 56:1<\/a>.  II. Great encouragement given to strangers that were willing to come  under the bonds of the covenant, assuring them of the blessings of the  covenant,   <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 56:3-8<\/a>.

And the  word of God was intended for conviction, as well as for comfort and  instruction in righteousness.<\/p>",
