Just as the fame of Israel&rsquo;s God spread among the nations when he delivered his people from bondage in Egypt and brought them to the Promised Land (<a class=\"ref\">Joshua 9:9<\/a>), so his fame spreads among the peoples who didn&rsquo;t participate in the exodus to Zion but who survive Jehovah&rsquo;s Day of Judgment: &ldquo;O Jehovah, you are my God; I will extol you by praising your name. For with perfect faithfulness you have performed wonders, things planned of old&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgxMjAiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 25:1<\/a>).<\/p>",
