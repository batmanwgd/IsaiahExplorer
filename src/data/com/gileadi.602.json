    "html": "<p>Those of Jehovah&rsquo;s people who become &ldquo;my people&rdquo;&mdash;by renewing his covenant and keeping its terms&mdash;ultimately come to know Jehovah (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MDI2LDE4MDMwXQ==\">Isaiah 19:21, 25<\/a>). While knowing <em>about<\/em> him&mdash;based on exercising faith and receiving a testimony of him through his holy Spirit&mdash;constitutes a first step toward knowing him in person, in the millennial age, the &ldquo;knowledge of Jehovah&rdquo; that overspreads the earth (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTc4OTQ=\">Isaiah 11:9<\/a>) implies much more than a belief in him. At his coming, Jehovah reveals himself personally to his elect as he did to Moses and Israel&rsquo;s elders (<a class=\"ref\">Exodus 24:9-11<\/a>; <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTgxMTk=\">Isaiah 24:23<\/a>; cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">6:1-8<\/a>).<\/p>",
