Those who grow weary of keeping Jehovah&rsquo;s law and word, who murmur against him as if he were the source of their problems, should realize that their vexations are the result of their own poor choices. As the &ldquo;God of eternity,&rdquo; Jehovah is the same yesterday, today, and forever and is no respecter of persons (<a class=\"ref\">2 Samuel 14:14<\/a>; <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg3NDgiOjN9XQ==\">Isaiah 55:7-9<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\">Acts 10:34<\/a>).<\/p><p>It isn&rsquo;t Jehovah who has neglected his people but they who have neglected him: &ldquo;You have forgotten your God, your salvation, and not remembered the Rock, your fortress&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc5OTQiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 17:10<\/a>). Jehovah is a God who &ldquo;defends the cause of his people&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg2OTYiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 51:22<\/a>). But instead of walking the straight &ldquo;path&rdquo; that he has decreed (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgxMzgiOjJ9XQ==\">Isaiah 26:7-8<\/a>), they have become &ldquo;unacquainted with the way of perfection; integrity is not within their bounds. They have made crooked their paths; none who treads them knows peace. Therefore redress remains far from us and righteousness is unable to reach us&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg4MDkiOjJ9XQ==\">Isaiah 59:8-9<\/a>).<\/p>",
