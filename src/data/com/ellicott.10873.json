The armies of Assyria are like a river in flood; the outspread waters on either side of the main stream are like the expanded wings of a great bird sweeping down on its prey.<\/p>\n <p>Shall fill the breadth of thy land, O Immanuel.\u2014The prophet has not forgotten, however, the nomen et omen of the earthly child, now growing towards the time when he would be able to \u201cchoose the good and refuse the evil.\u201d The land over which the flood sweeps belongs to Him who is, in very deed, \u201cGod with us.\u201d In <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 46:1-4<\/a> we have the prophecy turned into a hymn, or, less probably, the hymn which was the germ of the prophecy. The parallelism, in any case, is so clear as to make it certain that the two were contemporary, and refer to the same events. The same may be said, perhaps, of all the psalms of the sons of Korah. The hope of the psalmist fastens on the thought, \u201cthe Lord of hosts is with us\u201d (<a class=\"ref\">Psalms 46:7; Psalms 46:11<\/a>).<\/p>",
