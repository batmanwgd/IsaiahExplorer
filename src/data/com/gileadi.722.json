Although Jehovah destroys his alienated people, others who repent he saves &ldquo;for the sake of my servants&rdquo;&mdash;his &ldquo;chosen ones&rdquo;&mdash;who answer for their disloyalties in the ancient Near Eastern pattern of vassals to an emperor. Those saved, Jehovah &ldquo;extracts&rdquo; and refines like the juice of the grapes and they inherit &ldquo;mountains&rdquo; or nations (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg3MjciOjF9LHsiMTg4MDEiOjF9LHsiMTg4NDMiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 54:3; 58:14; 60:21<\/a>).<\/p>",
