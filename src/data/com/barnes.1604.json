The sense is, I will re-collect my scattered people from all parts of the world. The passage appears to have been taken from <a class=\"ref\">Deuteronomy 30:3<\/a>, where God promises to gather his people together again if they should be scattered among the nations, and should then repent. Vitringa understands this of the spiritual descendants of the Jews, or of those who should believe on the Messiah among the Gentiles, and who should become the people of God. But the more natural interpretation is, to refer it to the Jews who were scattered abroad during the exile at Babylon, and as a promise to re-collect them again in their own land.<\/p><p><em>From the east...<\/em>&mdash;From all parts of the earth; from all lands where they were scattered. That they were driven to other places than Babylon on the invasion of their land by the Chaldeans, is abundantly manifest in the historical records <a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 9:16; Ezekiel 5:12; Ezekiel 17:21; Amos 9:9; Zechariah 2:6<\/a>.<\/p>",
