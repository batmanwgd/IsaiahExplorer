    "html": "<p>Imbued with the knowledge of God, Jehovah&rsquo;s servant seeks to wake up Jehovah&rsquo;s people as he is awake (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTg2ODM=\">Isaiah 51:9<\/a>). Those who need waking up include their prophets and seers: &ldquo;Jehovah has poured out on you a spirit of deep sleep: he has shut your eyes, the prophets; he has covered your heads, the seers&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTgyMDQ=\">Isaiah 29:10<\/a>); &ldquo;Their watchmen are altogether blind and unaware; all of them are but dumb watchdogs unable to bark, lolling seers fond of slumber&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTg3NjQ=\">Isaiah 56:10<\/a>). With the servant&rsquo;s coming, many of Jehovah&rsquo;s people wake up and are reborn on higher spiritual levels (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3sic2luZ2xlcyI6WzE4NjkxXX0seyIxODY5OCI6Mn1d\">Isaiah 51:17; 52:1-2<\/a>).<\/p><p>The &ldquo;weary&rdquo; to whom Jehovah&rsquo;s servant preaches identifies the Jacob\/Israel category of Jehovah&rsquo;s people (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3sic2luZ2xlcyI6WzE4NTI4XX0seyIxODQ0OCI6NH1d\">Isaiah 40:27-30; 43:22<\/a>). A chaos motif, weariness implies failure to keep the law of Jehovah&rsquo;s covenant, with covenant curses following (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgxMDEiOjJ9LHsiMTg1MDIiOjV9XQ==\">Isaiah 24:5-6; 42:21-25<\/a>). Unlike the servant, who &ldquo;rebels not&rdquo; nor &ldquo;backs away&rdquo; from Jehovah, many do so: &ldquo;They are a rebellious people, sons who break faith, children unwilling to obey the law of Jehovah&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTgyMjc=\">Isaiah 30:9<\/a>; cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTg4Nzc=\">63:10<\/a>); &ldquo;We perceive our iniquities: willfully denying Jehovah, backing away from following our God&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 59:12-13<\/a>; cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTc2NTk=\">1:4<\/a>).<\/p>",
