    "html": "<p>As Jehovah had warned Ahaz, so he warns Ahaz&rsquo; people. By calling them &ldquo;these people&rdquo; or &ldquo;this people&rdquo; (<em>ha&lsquo;am hazzeh<\/em>), Jehovah disavows their covenantal status (cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc3NzkiOjJ9XQ==\">Isaiah 6:9-10<\/a>). As Ahaz proved disloyal to Jehovah, so Ahaz&rsquo; people prove disloyal to Ahaz. They favor the coalition of northern kings over the &ldquo;waters of Shiloah which flow gently&rdquo;&mdash;that is, over the Davidic dynasty Jehovah has appointed to rule over them. For conspiring to replace Ahaz, they will suffer worse than his rule&mdash;the rampaging <em>River<\/em> flooding beyond its borders&mdash;the king of Assyria at the height of his military power.<\/p>",
