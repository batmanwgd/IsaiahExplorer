    "html": "<p><em>For your shame \"Instead of your shame\" -<\/em>The translation of this verse, which is very confused, and probably corrupted in the Hebrew, is taken from the Syriac Version; except that the latter has not expressed the word <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05de\u05e9\u05e0\u05d4 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">mishneh<\/span>, double, in the first place. Five MSS. add the conjunction <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d5 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">vau<\/span>  to <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05e9\u05de\u05d7\u05ea <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">simchath<\/span> .
