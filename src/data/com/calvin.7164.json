    "html": "<p><i>And he saw a chariot. <\/i>What he now adds contains a lively description of that defeat. Some think that it is told by the king\u2019s messenger. This is a mistake; for the Prophet, on the contrary, foretells what he has learned from the watchman whom he appointed by the command of God. Here he represents the watchman as looking and reporting what he saw. As if at the first glance he had not seen it clearly, he says that there is \u201ca chariot,\u201d and afterwards observing more closely, he says that there is \u201ca couple of horses\u201d in the chariot. At first, on account of the novelty and great distance of the objects, the report given is ambiguous and confused; but afterwards, when a nearer view is obtained, they are better understood. There is no absurdity in applying to prophets or to divine visions what belongs to men; for we know that God, accommodating himself to our feeble capacity, takes upon himself human feelings. <\/p>",
