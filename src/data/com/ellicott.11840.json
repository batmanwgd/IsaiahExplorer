The sense is not that God alone knows what He hath prepared, but that no man knows (sight and hearing being used as including all forms of spiritual apprehension) any god who does such great things as He does. St. Paul, in <a class=\"ref\">1 Corinthians 2:9<\/a>, applies the words freely, after his manner, to the eternal blessings which God prepares for His people. Clement of Rome (chap. 34), it may be noted, makes a like application of the words, giving \u201cthose who wait for Him\u201d (as in Isaiah), instead of \u201cthose who love Him.\u201d<\/p>",
