The specific idea here is not that of the &ldquo;suddenness&rdquo; with which objects seen in a dream appear and then vanish, but it is that which occurs in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTgyMDI=\">Isaiah 29:8<\/a> , of one who dreams of eating and drinking, but who awakes, and is hungry and thirsty still. So it was with the Assyrian. He had set his heart on the wealth of Jerusalem. He had earnestly desired to possess that city&mdash;as a hungry man desires to satisfy the cravings of his appetite. But it would be like the vision of the night; and on that fatal morning on which he should awake from his fond dream <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTgzODk=\">Isaiah 37:36<\/a>, he would find all his hopes dissipated, and the longcherished desire of his soul unsatisfied still.<\/p>",
