The sense is, &lsquo;a time of distress and danger is evidently coming upon Egypt. They pretend to be wise; and there is now occasion for all their wisdom, and opportunity to evince it. Let them show it. Let them declare what is coming upon the nation, and take proper measures to meet and remove it; and they will then demonstrate that it would be proper for Pharaoh to repose confidence in them.&rsquo; But if they could not do this, then he should not suffer himself to be deluded, and his kingdom ruined, by their counsels.<\/p>",
