So Moses \u201chid his face, for he was afraid to look upon God\u201d (<a class=\"ref\">Exodus 3:6<\/a>). So Job \u201cabhorred himself and repented in dust and ashes\u201d (<a class=\"ref\">Job 42:6<\/a>). So Peter fell down at his Lord\u2019s feet, and cried, \u201cDepart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord\u201d (<a class=\"ref\">Luke 5:8<\/a>). Man at such a time feels his nothingness in the presence of the Eternal, his guilt in the presence of the All-holy. No man can see God and live. (Comp. also <a class=\"ref\">1 Samuel 6:20<\/a>.)<\/p>\n <p>I am a man of unclean lips.\u2014The prophet\u2019s words present at once a parallel and a contrast to those of Moses in <a class=\"ref\">Exodus 4:10<\/a>. The Lawgiver feels only, or chiefly, his want of the gift of utterance which was needed for his work. With Isaiah the dominant thought is that his lips have been defiled by past sins of speech. How can he join in the praises of the seraphim with those lips from which have so often come bitter and hasty words, formal and ceremonial prayers? (Comp. <a class=\"ref\">James 3:2; James 3:9<\/a>). His lips are \u201cunclean\u201d like those of one stricken, as Uzziah had been, by leprosy (<a class=\"ref\">Leviticus 13:45<\/a>). He finds no comfort in the thought that others are as bad as he is, that he \u201cdwells in the midst of a people of unclean lips.\u201d Were it otherwise, there might be some hope that influence from without might work his purification. As it is, he and his people seem certain to sink into the abyss. To \u201chave seen the King, the Lord of hosts,\u201d was in such a case simply overwhelming (<a class=\"ref\">Exodus 33:20<\/a>).<\/p>",
