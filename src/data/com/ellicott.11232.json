The words perhaps imply that this had been committed to writing, but that to the unbelievers they were as \u201cthe roll of a sealed book.\u201d The same imagery meets us in <a class=\"ref\">Revelation 5:2<\/a>. The wise of this world treated its dark sayings as seals, which forbade their making any attempt to study it. The poorer unlearned class could plead a more genuine and less guilty ignorance, but the effect was the same with both.<\/p>",
