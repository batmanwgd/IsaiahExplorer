    "html": "<p>A society&rsquo;s most likeable category&mdash;its young men or young people; and those most deserving of compassion&mdash;its fatherless and widows&mdash;no longer warrant admiration or sympathy. All have degenerated into &ldquo;godless malefactors&rdquo; whose language is permeated with &ldquo;profanities.&rdquo; The repeated phrase, &ldquo;Yet for all this his <em>anger<\/em> <strong> <\/strong>is not abated; his <em>hand<\/em><strong> <\/strong>is upraised still&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgxNzciOjN9XQ==\">vv 12, 17, 21<\/a>; emphasis added), signifies that even after successive waves of punishment, Jehovah&rsquo;s people remain unrepentant, perpetuating their alienated condition and covenant curse and their subjection to the Assyrian archtyrant.<\/p>",
