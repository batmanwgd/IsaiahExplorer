The curtains of thy habitations. The word &lsquo;curtain&rsquo; does not quite express the sense here. It is commonly with us used to denote the cloth hanging round. a bed or at a window, which may be spread or drawn aside at pleasure, or the hanging in theaters to conceal the stage from the spectators. The word here, however, denotes the canopy or cloth used in a tent; and the idea is, that the boundaries of the church were to be greatly enlarged, in order to accommodate the vast accession from the pagan world.<\/p><p><em>Spare not<\/em>&mdash;Do not be parsimonious in the provision of the materials for greatly enlarging the tent to dwell in.<\/p><p><em>Lengthen thy cords<\/em>&mdash;(See the note at <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgzMDAiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 33:20<\/a>).<\/p>",
