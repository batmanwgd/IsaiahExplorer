Like ancient Sodom and Gomorrah, such places remain uninhabitable because of the kind of destruction that occurred there: &ldquo;Her streams shall turn into lava and her earth into brimstone; her land shall become as burning pitch. Night and day it shall not be quenched; its smoke shall ascend forever. It shall remain a wasteland from generation to generation; through endless ages none shall traverse it&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODMxMyI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 34:9-10<\/a>).<\/p>",
