If they aren&rsquo;t there for that purpose, then all else doesn&rsquo;t count for much. That reveals an appalling paradox: instead of going to see Jehovah, his people resemble the dumb animals that were anciently brought for sacrifice, which were unaware of their reason for being there. Instead of making an offering of their whole souls to God&mdash;as symbolized by the burnt offerings and shedding of the animals&rsquo; blood&mdash;his people trudge about the temple&rsquo;s courts defiling it.<\/p>",
