When the world, which lies in wickedness, shall be laid in ruins, and  the Jewish church, which persisted in infidelity, shall become a  desolation, then the gospel church shall be set up and made to  flourish.  I. The Gentiles shall be brought into it,   <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTgzMjI=\">Isaiah 35:1<\/a>.  II. The well-wishers to it, who were weak and timorous, shall be  encouraged,   <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTgzMjQ=\">Isaiah 35:3<\/a>.  III. Miracles shall be wrought both on the souls and on the bodies of  men,   <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTgzMjY=\">Isaiah 35:5<\/a>.  IV. The gospel church shall be conducted in the way of holiness,   <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTgzMjk=\">Isaiah 35:8<\/a>.  V. It shall be brought at last to endless joys,   <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTgzMzE=\">Isaiah 35:10<\/a>.  Thus do we find more of Christ and heaven in this chapter than one  would have expected in the Old Testament.<\/p>",
