    "html": "<p><i>O ye deaf, hear, and ye blind. <\/i>He now employs these words, \u201cblind\u201d and \u201cdeaf,\u201d in a sense different from that in which he formerly employed them, (verse 16,) when he metaphorically described those who had no understanding, and who were overwhelmed by such a mass of afflictions that they were blinded by their sorrow; for here he gives the name of <i>blind <\/i>to those who shut their eyes in the midst of light, and do not behold the works of God; and the name of <i>deaf to <\/i>those who refuse to hear him, and sink down into stupidity and slothfulness amidst the dregs of their ignorance. He therefore condemns the Jews for \u201cblindness,\u201d or rather, in my own opinion, he condemns all men; for, while he directly reproaches the Jews because \u201cin hearing they do not hear, and in seeing they do not see,\u201d (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTc3Nzk=\">Isaiah 6:9<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\">Matthew 13:13<\/a>,) yet this applies in some measure to the Gentiles, to whom God revealed himself by his creatures, on whose hearts and consciences also he impressed the knowledge of him, and to whom he had made and would still make known his wonderful works. By demanding attention, he pronounces that there is nothing that hinders them from comprehending the truth and power of God, except that they are \u201cdeaf and blind.\u201d Nor is this unaccompanied by malice and ingratitude; for he openly instructs them concerning his power, and gives them very striking proofs of it; but no one gives attention to his doctrine or to his wonderful actions, and the consequence is, that they are willingly \u201cblind.\u201d Thus the Prophet shews that the fault lies wholly with men in not perceiving the power of God. <\/p>",
