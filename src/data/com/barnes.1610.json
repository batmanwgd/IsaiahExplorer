The design is, to affirm that there was no other being to whom the name &lsquo;Yahweh&rsquo; pertained. There was no other one who had the attributes which the name involved; there was, therefore, no other God. On the meanins of the word Yahweh, see the note at <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc2NTciOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 1:2<\/a>.<\/p><p><em>And beside me there is no Saviour<\/em>&mdash;There is no one who can deliver from oppression, and captivity, and exile, such as the Jews suffered in Babylon; there is no one but he who can save from sin, and from hell. All salvation, therefore, must come from God; and if we obtain deliverance from temporal ills, or from eternal death, we must seek it from him.<\/p>",
