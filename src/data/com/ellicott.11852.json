Here, however, the ground of the exclusiveness is not the consciousness of the peculiar privileges of Israel, but rests on what was an actual apostasy. Those of whom Isaiah speaks boasted of their initiation into heathen mysteries (Baal, Thammuz, or the like) as giving them a kind of consecrated character, and separating them from the profanum vulgus of the Israelites, who were faithful to the God of their fathers.<\/p>\n <p>I am holier than thou.\u2014Literally, I am holy to thee: i.e., one whom thou mayest not approach. (Comp. <a class=\"ref\">Leviticus 21:8<\/a>.) By some commentators the verb is taken as transitive, I make thee holy: i.e., have power to impart holiness; but this is less satisfactory, both grammatically and as to meaning.<\/p>\n <p>These are a smoke in my nose . . .\u2014The point of the clause is that the punishment is represented as not future. The self-exalting idolaters are already as those who are being consumed in the fire of the Divine wrath, and their smoke is \u201ca savour of death\u201d in the nostrils of Jehovah.<\/p>",
