These know that relation, and act according to it; but Israel did not, or rather would not, know. So Jeremiah dwells, turning to a different region of animal life, on the instinct which leads the stork, the swallow, and the crane to fulfil the law of their being (<a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 8:7<\/a>), while Israel \u201cknew not\u201d\u2014i.e., did not acknowledge\u2014the law of Jehovah.<\/p>",
