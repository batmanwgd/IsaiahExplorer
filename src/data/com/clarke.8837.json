(six ancient) of Dr. Kennicott's, thirty-six of De Rossi's, and two of my own, and the old edition of 1488 have the noun in the plural number, <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05e0\u05e4\u05e9\u05d9\u05e0\u05d5 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">naphsheynu<\/span>, our souls; and so the Septuagint, Chaldee, and Vulgate. This reading is undoubtedly genuine.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>In the day of your fast ye find pleasure -<\/em>Fast days are generally called holidays, and holidays are days of idleness and pleasure. In numberless cases the fast is turned into a feast.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>And exact all your labors -<\/em>Some disregard the most sacred fast, and will oblige their servant to work all day long; others use fast days for the purpose of settling their accounts, posting up their books, and drawing out their bills to be ready to collect their debts. These are sneaking hypocrites; the others are daringly irreligious.<\/p>",
