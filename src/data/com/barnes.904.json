It is not remarkable that the name Immanuel should also be given to the same child, as signifying the presence and protection of God in defending the nation from the invaders; see the notes at <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc3OTciOjJ9XQ==\">Isaiah 7:14-15<\/a>. Calvin thinks that all this passed in a vision before the prophet; but it has every mark of being a literal narrative of the birth of a son to Isaiah; and without this supposition, it is impossible to understand the account contained here.<\/p>",
