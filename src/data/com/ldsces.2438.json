    "html": "<p><em>Rereward<\/em> is an older word meaning &ldquo;rear guard.&rdquo; The Hebrew word <em>asaph<\/em> has the root meaning of &ldquo;to gather&rdquo; and, as used in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg3OTUiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 58:8<\/a>, &ldquo;it is applied to the gathering up of the scattered rear of an army, or the keeping it from straggling, and defending it from the attacks of an enemy&rdquo; (William Wilson, <em>Old Testament Word Studies,<\/em> s.v. &ldquo;rereward.&rdquo;) A better translation would be &ldquo;the glory of Jehovah will gather thee, or keep thee together, <em>i.e.<\/em> be thy rear-guard&rdquo; (C. F. Keil and F. Delitzsch, <em>Commentary on the Old Testament,<\/em> 7:2:390).<\/p><p>&ldquo;When Israel is diligent in the performance of works of compassionate love, it is like an army on the march or travelling caravan, for which righteousness clears and shows the way as being the most appropriate gift of God, and whose rear is closed by the glory of God, which so conducts it to its goal that not one is left behind&rdquo; (Keil and Delitzsch, <em>Commentary,<\/em> 7:2:390).<\/p><p class=\"cite\">LDS Church Educational System Old Testament Student Manual, 1 Kings&ndash;Malachi, Religion 302, Chapter 18, Item 10<\/p>",
