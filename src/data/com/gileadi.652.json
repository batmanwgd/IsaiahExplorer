    "html": "<p>Although Jehovah does contend and get angry with his people when they transgress, he doesn&rsquo;t do so &ldquo;forever&rdquo; or &ldquo;always&rdquo; as all are not on the same spiritual level (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3OTAyLDE3ODc2LDE4ODMyLDE4ODk1XQ==\">Isaiah 12:1; 10:25; 60:10; 64:9<\/a>). Because he deals with people according to what they are empowered to endure, he expects more from those in higher categories than from those lower. And yet, when people&rsquo;s wickedness reaches a surfeit, as it did before the Flood, his spirit ceases to strive with man and his judgments follow (<a class=\"ref\">Genesis 6:1-13<\/a>; cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3sic2luZ2xlcyI6WzE4NzMzXX0seyIxODg2OCI6Nn1d\">Isaiah 54:9; 63:1-6<\/a>). Jehovah suspends his mercy until his justice achieves the desired effect.<\/p>",
