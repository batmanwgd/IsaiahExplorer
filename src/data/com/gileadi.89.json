The terms &ldquo;wine&rdquo; and &ldquo;liquor&rdquo; form word link to the opulent of Jehovah&rsquo;s people being overcome with &ldquo;wine&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgxNjYiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 28:1<\/a>) and to their prophets laboring under a &ldquo;wine&rdquo; of delusion: &ldquo;These too have indulged in wine and are giddy with strong drink: priests and prophets have gone astray through liquor. They are intoxicated with wine and stagger because of strong drink; they err as seers, they blunder in their decisions&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgxNzIiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 28:7<\/a>).<\/p>",
