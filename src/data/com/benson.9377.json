    "html": "<p><a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTg1MDI=\">Isaiah 42:21<\/a>.<i>The Lord is well pleased, <\/i>&c. \u2014 Although thou art a wicked people, that rebellest against the clearest light, and therefore God might justly destroy thee suddenly, yet he will patiently wait for thy repentance, that he may be gracious; and that not for thy sake, but for the glory of his own faithfulness, in fulfilling that covenant which he made with thy pious progenitors. <i>He will magnify the law <\/i>\u2014 He will maintain the honour of his law, and therefore is not forward to destroy you, who profess the true religion, lest his law should, upon that occasion, be exposed to contempt. Thus the verse may be interpreted according to the present translation. But it may be rendered differently, as it is by Vitringa and Dr. Waterland, thus: \u201cThe Lord took delight in him for his righteousness\u2019 sake; he hath magnified him by his law, and made him honourable.\u201d God liberally provided for his people whatever was needful or useful, in order to their salvation and the stability of their state. \u201cHe had given them excellent laws; he had increased and honoured them; had made, and was willing to make them glorious among their neighbours. But they had been wanting to themselves, had despised his laws, and incurred his just vengeance.\u201d \u2014 Dodd.<\/p>",
