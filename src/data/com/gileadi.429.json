    "html": "<p>Just as Jehovah gives King Ahaz a &ldquo;sign&rdquo; under a similar circumstance of a threatening king of Assyria (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzc5NyI6N30=\">Isaiah 7:14-20<\/a>), so he gives Hezekiah a &ldquo;sign.&rdquo; In fact, Jehovah&rsquo;s sign to Ahaz a generation earlier&mdash;of a son Immanuel (&ldquo;God Is with Us&rdquo;) who would eat cream and honey during a time of upheaval and invasion&mdash;was fulfilled in Hezekiah&rsquo;s childhood when Tiglath Pileser III deported peoples of Israel&rsquo;s ten-tribed Northern Kingdom into Mesopotamia (<a class=\"ref\">2 Kings 15:29<\/a>). Like the son Immanuel, those who survived in the land would likewise eat cream and honey, the food of nomads (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzgwNCI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 7:21-22<\/a>).<\/p><p>Jehovah&rsquo;s sign to King Hezekiah of just such a time of scarcity, however, has a happy ending. Because he and his people have passed Jehovah&rsquo;s test of their loyalty, Jehovah is bound by the terms of his covenant to deliver them. In spite of their suffering covenant curses reaching back a generation, Hezekiah&rsquo;s people can reverse the curse and again generate covenant blessings. In a future version of these events, an end-time son Immanuel&mdash;Jehovah&rsquo;s son and servant&mdash;similarly eats nomadic fare and intercedes with Jehovah on behalf of his people when an end-time Assyrian archtyrant invades their land.<\/p>",
