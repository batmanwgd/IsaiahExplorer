Like the raising of the hand, the raising of the ensign causes Jehovah\u2019s people to return from exile: they return from many countries (v 11); they gather from the four directions of the earth (v 12). The synonymous parallelism of Jehovah\u2019s raising his hand and raising an ensign in order to bring about Israel\u2019s return isn\u2019t limited to this passage but reappears cumulatively elsewhere as well, see {Isaiah 49:22}.  This, however, identifies the term ensign as a metaphorical pseudonym or alias of a future Davidic figure\u2014that is, \u201cthe sprig of Jesse, who stands for an ensign to the peoples\u201d (v 10). Like King David, a ruling descendant of David was sometimes known simply as \u201cthe son of Jesse\u201d {1 Chronicles 12:18; cf. 1 Samuel 17:12}. By identifying the term ensign as a pseudonym of a Davidic figure\u2014the \u201csprig of Jesse\u201d {v 10}\u2014this passage thus also establishes an identity for the term hand (v 11). Because ensign and hand synonymously parallel each other in verses 11\u201312 and elsewhere {Isaiah 5:25\u201326; 49:22}, and because the ensign is identified as a ruler from David\u2019s line {Isaiah 11:10}, the term hand must also be a pseudonym of the Davidic figure, their synonymous use implying that both terms describe the same individual.",

Similarly, so long as Moses or Joshua stretched out the hand, the Israelites prevailed over their enemies in battle {Exodus 17:11; Joshua 8:18\u201319}.

They need waking up to the imminent judgments of God hanging over the world that will surely overtake them unless they renew their covenant relationship with him, repent of their waywardness, and return wholeheartedly to their God. Only on those conditions can they participate in his salvation, temporal and spiritual.",

As a proxy savior under the terms of the Davidic Covenant, he serves justice on behalf of those unable to make restitution in kind for transgressing against God, which restitution only a God can make. As a sacrificial offering prefigured by the Law of Moses, he atones for sin so that God may extend his mercy to all who repent. His glorious coming as King of Zion to institute his reign of peace on the earth, preceded by his earthly tenure as a \u201cman of sorrows\u201d who redeems humanity from the Fall, comprise the two most significant events to impact human history. As all salvation, temporal and spiritual, comes from God, under what principles does salvation operate? Even proxy saviors under the terms of the Davidic Covenant on the seraph and son\/servant levels only create the conditions for salvation to occur. They don\u2019t actually save their peoples themselves\u2014Israel\u2019s God does. Still, even he, Jehovah, follows the same pattern he has laid down on whose basis all proxy salvation occurs: on the model of ancient Near Eastern emperor\u2013vassal covenants, the vassal answers for the disloyalties of his people to the emperor. In practical terms, those disloyalties consist of God\u2019s people\u2019s sins and transgressions before God, which Jehovah takes upon himself.",

And it happened that as they journeyed from the east they found a plain in the land of Shinar and dwelt there. And they said one to another, \u2018Come, let us make bricks and fire them thoroughly.\u2019 (For they had bricks for stone and cement for mortar.) And they said, \u2018Come, let us build a city for ourselves and a tower whose top reaches heaven. And let us make a name for ourselves in case we disperse over the whole face of the earth.\u2019 And Jehovah came down to see the city and tower the sons of men were building. And Jehovah said, \u2018See, the people are one; all have a single language. Now that they have started this, they will stop at nothing that they imagine they can do. Come, let us go down there and confound their language so they won\u2019t understand each other\u2019s words.\u2019 Jehovah therefore scattered them from there over the face of the whole earth. So they left off building the city. And hence its name is called Babel because there Jehovah confounded the language of the whole earth, and from there Jehovah scattered them over the face of the whole earth\u201d ({Genesis 11:1\u20139}). The idea of a \u201ccity\u201d with a \u201ctower\u201d whose top reaches the \u201csky\u201d or \u201cheaven\u201d is not unfamiliar in today\u2019s world. Modern cities and their skyscrapers in many ways duplicate the ancient \u201cBabel\u201d or \u201cBabylon\u201d society with its materialistic socio\u2013economic structure. As people today are indeed \u201cscattered over the face of the whole earth,\u201d God\u2019s plan is to bring them back together. But that event occurs on his terms as in the end it is his elect according to his covenant who thus reunite ({Deuteronomy 30:1\u20136; Jeremiah 31:10}; {Ezekiel 11:16\u201317}; 20:33\u201344; {Matthew 24:31}). At that time, God gives his people \u201ca pure language so that all may all call on the name of Jehovah and serve him with one accord\u201d ({Zephaniah 3:9}).",

And when Moses\u2019 father\u2013in\u2013law saw all he was doing for the people, he said, \u2018What is it that you are doing for the people? Why do you sit alone and all the people stand by you from morning to evening?\u2019 And Moses said to his father\u2013in\u2013law, \u2018Because the people come to me to inquire of God. When they have a matter, they come to me and I judge between the one and the other and acquaint them with the statutes and laws of God.\u2019 \u201cThen Moses\u2019 father\u2013in\u2013law said to him, \u2018What you are doing isn\u2019t good. You will certainly wear yourself out, you and these people with you. This is too burdensome a thing for you. You can\u2019t undertake it all by yourself. Listen to me as I counsel you, then God will be with you. You be there for the people as God, bringing their causes to God. You teach them the ordinances and laws and show them the way they should go and the works they should do. But in addition arrange for able men from among the people\u2014those who fear God, men of truth, who hate covetousness\u2014and appoint them over them as rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens. Let them judge the people at all times. Let them bring every serious matter to you, but let them judge every small matter themselves. Then will it be easier for you, and they will bear [the burden] with you. If you do that, and if God commands you [to do] so, then you will be able to endure it, and also all these people can go to their place in peace.\u2019",

While the Bible makes no mention of a covenant in connection with Adam and Eve, it is nevertheless clear that one existed: (1) because all commandments God gives, including those he gave Adam and Eve ({Genesis 1:28; 2:15\u201317}), constitute the terms of a covenant; and (2) because the paradisiacal state Adam and Eve inherited was a covenant blessing. Those who live into the earth\u2019s millennial age, for example, similarly inherit a paradisiacal state as a covenant blessing. Their spousal relationships\u2014which form an integral part of their covenant relationship with God\u2014parallel Adam\u2019s and Eve\u2019s. God also made a covenant with Noah: \u201cSee, I of myself bring a flood of waters upon the earth to destroy all flesh from under heaven in which is the breath of life. And everything in the earth will die. But with you I will establish my covenant, and you will come into the ark, you and your sons, your wife and your sons\u2019 wives, with you\u201d ({Genesis 6:17\u201318}).",
