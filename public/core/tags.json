Like the raising of the hand, the raising of the ensign causes Yahweh\u2019s people to return from exile: they return from many countries (v 11); they gather from the four directions of the earth (v 12). The synonymous parallelism of Yahweh\u2019s raising his hand and raising an ensign in order to bring about Israel\u2019s return isn\u2019t limited to this passage but reappears cumulatively elsewhere as well, see {Isaiah 49:22}.  This, however, identifies the term ensign as a metaphorical pseudonym or alias of a future Davidic figure\u2014that is, \u201cthe sprig of Jesse, who stands for an ensign to the peoples\u201d (v 10). Like King David, a ruling descendant of David was sometimes known simply as \u201cthe son of Jesse\u201d {1 Chronicles 12:18; cf. 1 Samuel 17:12}. By identifying the term ensign as a pseudonym of a Davidic figure\u2014the \u201csprig of Jesse\u201d {v 10}\u2014this passage thus also establishes an identity for the term hand (v 11). Because ensign and hand synonymously parallel each other in verses 11\u201312 and elsewhere {Isaiah 5:25\u201326; 49:22}, and because the ensign is identified as a ruler from David\u2019s line {Isaiah 11:10}, the term hand must also be a pseudonym of the Davidic figure, their synonymous use implying that both terms describe the same individual.",

Yahweh offers gratis a \u201ccovenant\u201d (berit) of survival or sustenance\u2014\u201cthat your souls may live\u201d (tehi napsekem) (v 3). An abundance of food and drink symbolizes Yahweh\u2019s word as nourishment and the covenantal benediction that accompanies a positive response to Yahweh\u2019s word. By exhorting all to \u201ceat what is good!\u201d (v 2), Yahweh calls them to covenantal loyalty.303 The appeal to \u201chear well\u201d (sim\u2018u samoa\u2018) (v 2), which the passage repeats (v 3), calls attention to Yahweh\u2019s Covenant of Life. That appeal points to Yahweh\u2019s word as the antidote to maledictory hunger and thirst (v 1) and to the implicit alternative of death. Yahweh\u2019s covenant subsists in his ideal vassal (v 3), who serves as Yahweh\u2019s spokesman to the nations (v 4). These things accord with the vassal\u2019s personifying Yahweh\u2019s covenant and serving as his lawgiver and light to the nations in earlier material (Isaiah 42:1, 4, 6; 49:6). The second unit modifies or redefines these cumulative concepts by depicting the ideal vassal as Yahweh\u2019s living oracle. Because Yahweh\u2019s covenant embodies his law and word, the ideal vassal\u2019s role as his living oracle flows naturally out of his personifying Yahweh\u2019s covenant. Yahweh\u2019s appointing him as a \u201cwitness\u201d (\u2018ed), \u201cprince\u201d (nagid), and \u201clawgiver\u201d (mesawweh) to the nations (v 4) expresses the ideal vassal\u2019s redemptive role as Yahweh\u2019s representative.",

And it happened that as they journeyed from the east they found a plain in the land of Shinar and dwelt there. And they said one to another, \u2018Come, let us make bricks and fire them thoroughly.\u2019 (For they had bricks for stone and cement for mortar.) And they said, \u2018Come, let us build a city for ourselves and a tower whose top reaches heaven. And let us make a name for ourselves in case we disperse over the whole face of the earth.\u2019 And Yahweh came down to see the city and tower the sons of men were building. And Yahweh said, \u2018See, the people are one; all have a single language. Now that they have started this, they will stop at nothing that they imagine they can do. Come, let us go down there and confound their language so they won\u2019t understand each other\u2019s words.\u2019 Yahweh therefore scattered them from there over the face of the whole earth. So they left off building the city. And hence its name is called Babel because there Yahweh confounded the language of the whole earth, and from there Yahweh scattered them over the face of the whole earth\u201d ({Genesis 11:1\u20139}). The idea of a \u201ccity\u201d with a \u201ctower\u201d whose top reaches the \u201csky\u201d or \u201cheaven\u201d is not unfamiliar in today\u2019s world. Modern cities and their skyscrapers in many ways duplicate the ancient \u201cBabel\u201d or \u201cBabylon\u201d society with its materialistic socio\u2013economic structure. As people today are indeed \u201cscattered over the face of the whole earth,\u201d God\u2019s plan is to bring them back together. But that event occurs on his terms as in the end it is his elect according to his covenant who thus reunite ({Deuteronomy 30:1\u20136; Jeremiah 31:10}; {Ezekiel 11:16\u201317}; 20:33\u201344; {Matthew 24:31}). At that time, God gives his people \u201ca pure language so that all may all call on the name of Yahweh and serve him with one accord\u201d ({Zephaniah 3:9}).",

You have already observed this to a degree in the metaphors Isaiah chooses that nuance the character of God\u2019s endtime servant and the king of Assyria\/Babylon. Terms such as ensign, hand, trumpet, voice, arm, righteousness, bird of prey, light, darkness, anger, and wrath reveal a lot about what kind of persons we are dealing with. Even the character of Israel\u2019s God Jehovah is evident in such terms as arm, rock, and salvation. As with the metaphors that act as pseudonyms of real persons, actual names of persons and peoples and the activities associated with them tell us much about who Isaiah is referring to. At times, for example, Isaiah addresses God\u2019s people using the paired names \u201cJacob\u201d and \u201cIsrael\u201d but at other times the names \u201cZion\u201d and \u201cJerusalem.\u201d What, we might ask, is the difference?",
