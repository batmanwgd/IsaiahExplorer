Elsewhere, however, as in the case of Deborah (<a class=\"ref\">Judges 4:4<\/a>) and Huldah (<a class=\"ref\">2 Chronicles 34:22<\/a>), it implies prophetic gifts. Possibly, therefore, we may think of the prophet and his wife as having been drawn together by united thoughts and counsels, in contrast with the celibate life of Jeremiah (<a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 16:2<\/a>), the miseries of Hosea\u2019s marriage (Hosea 1, 2), and the sudden bereavement of Ezekiel (<a class=\"ref\">Ezekiel 24:16-18<\/a>). We may, perhaps, trace, on this view, the wife\u2019s hand in the toilet inventory of <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 3:16-24<\/a>.<\/p>",
