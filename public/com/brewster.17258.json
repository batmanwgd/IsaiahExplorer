Zion, His covenant people, will never be cast off. Such a vow reminds us of the dream interpreted by the prophet Daniel, where he saw \"the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms,and it shall stand for ever.\" (<a class=\"ref\">Daniel 2:44<\/a>; see also <a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 65:2-3; 104:86; 112:30<\/a>.)<\/p>",
