An<strong>a<\/strong> -<strong>b<\/strong> -<strong>a<\/strong> chiasm identifies that work as &ldquo;children&rdquo; or &ldquo;sons&rdquo; (<em>banay<\/em>); that is, the rebirth on a higher spiritual level of proxy saviors&mdash;Jehovah&rsquo;s elect&mdash;under the terms of the Davidic Covenant. But because that outcome doesn&rsquo;t conform to what many believe, they oppose it. The chaos motifs of &ldquo;shards&rdquo; and &ldquo;clay&rdquo;&mdash;like those of &ldquo;dust&rdquo; and &ldquo;stubble&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDU0XQ==\">Isaiah 41:2<\/a>)&mdash;identify the opposers as persons in authority whom Jehovah reduces to chaos in his Day of Judgment (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDc3XQ==\">Isaiah 41:25<\/a>):<\/p><p>&ldquo;My Lord says, &lsquo;Because these people approach me with the mouth and pay me homage with their lips, while their heart remains far from me&mdash;their piety toward me consisting of commandments of men learned by rote&mdash;therefore it is that I shall again astound these people with wonder upon wonder, rendering void the knowledge of their sages and the intelligence of their wise men insignificant.&rsquo;... What a contradiction you are! Shall the potter be regarded as the clay? Shall what is made say of its maker, &lsquo;He did not make me,&rsquo; or a work of its designer, &lsquo;He doesn&rsquo;t understand?&rsquo;&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgyMDciOjJ9LHsiMTgyMDciOjJ9LFsxODIxMF1d\">Isaiah 29:13-14, Isaiah 29:13-14, 16<\/a>).<\/p><p>The &ldquo;signs&rdquo; that the adversaries of Jehovah&rsquo;s work ask for&mdash;which, in the end, consist of their being reduced to broken shards&mdash;identify them with other sign seekers who are in authority who excommunicate Jehovah&rsquo;s servants: &ldquo;Hear the word of Jehovah, you who are vigilant for his word: Your brethren who abhor you, and exclude you because of my name, say, &lsquo;Let Jehovah manifest his glory, that we may see cause for your joy!&rsquo; But it is they who shall suffer shame. Hark, a tumult from the city, a noise from the temple! It is the voice of Jehovah paying his enemies what is due them&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODkyOCI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 66:5-6<\/a>).<\/p><p>Jehovah&rsquo;s<em>hands<\/em> are two: (1) the servant who restores Jehovah&rsquo;s people; and (2) the archtyrant who destroys a wicked world. Persons in the Jacob\/Israel category who ascend to Zion\/Jerusalem, whose subjection to the archtyrant has helped to refine them, Jehovah&rsquo;s servant delivers at the last. The<strong>a<\/strong> -<strong>b<\/strong> -<strong>a<\/strong> chiasm of Jehovah as &ldquo;Maker&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NTcxXQ==\">v 9<\/a>)&mdash;<strong>a<\/strong> ; as &ldquo;Father&rdquo; (<em>&rsquo;ab<\/em>) (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NTcyXQ==\">v 10<\/a>)&mdash;<strong>b<\/strong> ; and as &ldquo;Maker&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NTczXQ==\">v 11<\/a>)&mdash;<strong>a<\/strong> identifies Jehovah&rsquo;s role as the divine emperor of &ldquo;sons&rdquo; or vassals under the terms of the Davidic Covenant and the &ldquo;Woman&rdquo; or &ldquo;Wife&rdquo; (<em>&rsquo;issa<\/em>) as the Woman Zion who gives them birth (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODkzMCI6M30=\">Isaiah 66:7-9<\/a>).<\/p> ",
