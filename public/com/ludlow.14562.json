    "title": "A Song of Scorn over the Fallen King of Babylon",
    "html": "<p>This chapter envisions the peaceful period following the Babylon destruction that was prophesied in the previous chapter. It also foretells the ultimate fate of the king of Babylon. Isaiah&rsquo;s prophecy has dual meaning&mdash;describing both Babylon the ancient city with her political rulers, and Babylon the symbol of worldliness, whose king is Lucifer. As the leader of an Israelite settlement on a new continent, Nephi included it as the last chapter in his block of Isaiah&rsquo;s writings. He had witnessed Babylon&rsquo;s powerful influence before his family left Jerusalem, and he wanted his people to avoid similar worldliness and evil among their descendants. This prophet also knew that Satan would constantly oppose God&rsquo;s Zion society with an attractive but counterfeit Babylonian society. Nephi surely hoped his people would remember God&rsquo;s promises of rest and peace to the righteous as well as of frustration and chaos for Babylon&rsquo;s king and his subjects.<\/p>",
