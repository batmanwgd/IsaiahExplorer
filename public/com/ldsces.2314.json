    "html": " <p>The Saints are so determined to offer to the Lord a worthy gift of gathered Israel that, as the Prophet Joseph Smith said, they &ldquo;have labored without pay, to instruct the United States [and now the world] that the gathering had commenced in the western boundaries of Missouri, to build a holy city, where, as may be seen in the eighteenth chapter of Isaiah, the present should &lsquo;be brought unto the Lord of Hosts.&rsquo;&rdquo; (<em>History of the Church, <\/em>,2:132.) Mount Zion is identified in modern revelation as the New Jerusalem (see <a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 84:2 <\/a>). Thus, once the Church is restored and Ephraim begins the work of gathering Israel from their scattered and peeled condition (see Notes and Commentary on Isaiah 11:13&ndash;14), they can present <em>a restored house of Jacob <\/em>,to the Lord as a gift that will delight Him. <\/p> <p>The Jerusalem Bible renders the phrase in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 18 <\/a>,, &ldquo;a people terrible from their beginning,&rdquo; as &ldquo;the nation always feared&rdquo;; and it renders the phrase &ldquo;whose land the rivers have spoiled&rdquo; as &ldquo;the country criss-crossed with rivers.&rdquo; These passages seem to refer to America, where the Restoration was to take place. <\/p> <p class=\"cite\">,LDS Church Educational System Old Testament Student Manual, 1 Kings&ndash;Malachi, Religion 302, Chapter 14, Item 25 <\/p>,",
