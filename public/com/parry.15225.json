    "html": " <p> Isaiah addresses the issue of trusting in man rather than in God. Judah's leaders sought an alliance with Egypt against Assyria, contrary to the counsel of the Lord (30:1-2). Now Isaiah promises that their reliance on Egypt will be unfruitful and will cause their downfall (30:3). Because of Judah's wickedness and her rebellion against God, her destruction will come \"suddenly at an instant\" (30:13). Her sins are many: she does not take counsel from the Lord (30:1); she does not pray to the Lord (30:2); she trusts Egypt and its horses rather than the Lord (30:2, 16); she carries her riches there (30:6); she rejects her prophets and seers and desires them to prophesy \"smooth things\" and lies (30:10); and she despises God's word (30:12). Note the Lord's command to Isaiah to record this prophecy in a book so that future generations, including our own, will learn that Judah was \"a rebellious people\" (30:8-9).<\/p> <blockquote> Woe to the rebellious children, saith the Lord, that <i>take counsel,<\/i> but <u>not of me<\/u>;     <br>and that <i>poured out a libation, but <u>not of my spirit<\/u>,<\/i> that they may add sin to sin: (30:1)     <br>That <i>walk to go down<\/i> into <u>Egypt<\/u><i>,<\/i> and have not asked at my mouth;     <br>to <i>strengthen<\/i> themselves in the <u>strength of Pharaoh<\/u><i>,<\/i>     <br>and to <i>trust in<\/i> the<i> <\/i><u>shadow of Egypt<\/u>! (30:2)     <br>Therefore shall the <i>strength of Pharaoh<\/i> be your <u>shame<\/u><i>,<\/i>     <br>and the <i>trust in the shadow of Egypt<\/i> your <u>confusion<\/u><i>.<\/i> (30:3)     <br>For his <i>princes<\/i> were at <u>Zoan<\/u><i>,<\/i>     <br>and his <i>ambassadors<\/i> came to <u>Hanes<\/u><i>.<\/i> (30:4)     <br><i>They were all ashamed<\/i> of a people that could <u>not profit them<\/u><i>,<\/i>     <br><u>nor be an help nor profit<\/u><i>,<\/i> but a <i>shame, and also a reproach.<\/i> (30:5)     <br>The burden of the beasts of the south: into the land of trouble and anguish,     <br>from whence come the young and old lion,     <br>the viper and fiery flying serpent,     <br>they will carry their <i>riches<\/i> upon the <u>shoulders of young asses<\/u><i>,<\/i>     <br>and their <i>treasures<\/i> upon the <u>bunches of camels<\/u><i>,<\/i> to a people that shall not profit them. (30:6)     <br>For the Egyptians shall help in vain, and to no purpose:     <br>therefore have I cried concerning this, Their strength is to sit still. (30:7)     <br>Now go, <i>write<\/i> it before them in a <u>table<\/u><i>,<\/i>     <br>and <i>note<\/i> it in a <u>book<\/u><i>,<\/i>     <br>that it may be for the time to come for ever and ever: (30:8)     <br>That this is a <i>rebellious <\/i><u>people<\/u><i>,<\/i> <i>lying <\/i><u>children<\/u><i>,<\/i>     <br><u>children<\/u><i> that will not hear the law of the Lord:<\/i> (30:9)     <br>Which say to the <i>seers,<\/i> <u>See not<\/u>;     <br>and to the <i>prophets,<\/i> <u>Prophesy not<\/u> unto us right things,     <br><i>speak<\/i> unto us <u>smooth things<\/u><i>,<\/i>     <br><i>prophesy<\/i> <u>deceits<\/u>: (30:10)     <br><i>Get<\/i> you out <u>of the way<\/u><i>,<\/i>     <br><i>turn aside<\/i> <u>out of the path<\/u><i>,<\/i>     <br><i>cause the Holy One of Israel<\/i> <u>to cease from before us<\/u><i>.<\/i> (30:11)     <br>Wherefore thus saith the Holy One of Israel,     <br>Because ye <i>despise<\/i> <u>this word<\/u><i>,<\/i>     <br>and <i>trust<\/i> in <i>oppression<\/i> and <u>perverseness<\/u><i>,<\/i>     <br>and <i>stay<\/i> <u>thereon<\/u>: (30:12)     <br>Therefore this iniquity shall be to you as a <i>breach<\/i> ready to fall,     <br><i>swelling out<\/i> in a high wall,     <br>whose <i>breaking<\/i> cometh suddenly at an instant. (30:13)     <br>And <i>he<\/i> <i>shall break it<\/i> as the <u>breaking of the potters'<\/u> vessel that is broken in pieces;     <br><i>he<\/i> <i>shall not spare:<\/i> so that there shall not be found in the <u>bursting of it a sherd<\/u>     <br>to <i>take<\/i> <i>fire<\/i> <u>from the hearth<\/u><i>,<\/i>     <br>or to <i>take<\/i> <i>water<\/i> withal <u>out of the pit<\/u><i>.<\/i> (30:14)     <br>For thus saith the Lord God, the Holy One of Israel;     <br>In <i>returning<\/i> <i>and<\/i> <i>rest<\/i> shall ye <u>be saved<\/u>;     <br>in <i>quietness<\/i> <i>and in<\/i> <i>confidence<\/i> shall <u>be your strength<\/u>:     <br>and <i>ye<\/i> <u>would not<\/u><i>.<\/i> (30:15)     <br>But <i>ye<\/i> <i>said,<\/i> <u>No<\/u>;     <br>for <i>we<\/i> <u>will flee<\/u> upon horses;     <br>therefore <u>shall<\/u> <i>ye<\/i> <u>flee<\/u>:     <br>and, <i>We<\/i> will <u>ride upon the swift<\/u>;     <br>therefore shall <i>they<\/i> that <u>pursue you be swift<\/u><i>.<\/i> (30:16)     <br><i>One thousand shall flee<\/i> at the <u>rebuke of one<\/u>;     <br>at the <u>rebuke of five<\/u> shall <i>ye flee:<\/i>     <br>till ye be left as a <i>beacon<\/i> <u>upon the top of a mountain<\/u>,     <br>and as an <i>ensign<\/i> <u>on an hill<\/u><i>.<\/i> (30:17)<\/blockquote> ",
