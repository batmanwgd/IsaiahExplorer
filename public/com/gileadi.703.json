The antithetical parallelism of Jehovah &ldquo;alone&rdquo; treading out a vatful with no one of &ldquo;the nations&rdquo; with him, infers that he alone atones&mdash;or is capable of atoning&mdash;for the transgressions of all: &ldquo;We all like sheep had gone astray, each of us headed his own way; Jehovah brought together upon him the iniquity of us all&rdquo; ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzE4XQ==\">Isaiah 53:6<\/a>). He, therefore, is uniquely eligible to consign them to being &ldquo;trodden underfoot&rdquo; by the king of Assyria\/Babylon&mdash;his<em>anger<\/em> and<em>wrath<\/em> ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzg1NiI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 10:5-6<\/a>).<\/p> ",
