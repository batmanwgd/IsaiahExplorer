It does not mean that the character of the priest would have any influence on that of the people, or that because the one was corrupt the other would be; but it means that all would be involved in the same calamity, and there would be no favored class that would escape. The prophet, therefore, enumerate the various ranks of the people, and shows that all classes would be involved in the impending calamity. <\/p> <p> <em>As with the taker of usury <\/em>&mdash;He who lends his money at interest. It was contrary to the Mosaic law for one Israelite to take interest of another <a class=\"ref\">Leviticus 25:36; Deuteronomy 23:19; Nehemiah 5:7, Nehemiah 5:10<\/a>; but it is not probable that this law was very carefully observed, and especially in the corrupt times that preceded the Babylonian captivity. <\/p> ",
