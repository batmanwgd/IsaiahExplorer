It comes as the climax of the chastisement of the daughters of Zion, as the companion picture to <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzE0XQ==\">Isaiah 3:6<\/a>. As men sought eagerly, yet in vain, a protector, so women should seek for a husband. Those who had been wooed and courted, and had been proudly fastidious, should supplicate in eager rivalry (the seven women to one man implies a land depopulated by war, and so making polygamy natural) for the protection of marriage, and that not on the usual conditions of having food and clothing found for them (<a class=\"ref\">Exodus 21:10<\/a>), but as working for their own livelihood. <\/p> \n <p>To take away our reproach.\u2014Better, as an imperative, take thou away. The reproach is that of being childless. From the Jewish standpoint that was not only the great sorrow, but the great shame, of womanhood, implying, as men thought, a sin of which it was the chastisement (<a class=\"ref\">Genesis 30:23; 1 Samuel 1:6; Luke 1:25<\/a>). <\/p> ",
