Arrows were, of course, made sharp, and usually pointed with iron, for the purpose of penetrating the shields or coats of mail which were used to guard against them. <\/p> <p> <em>And all their bows bent <\/em>&mdash;All ready for battle. <\/p> <p>Their horses&rsquo; hoofs shall be counted like flint&mdash;It is supposed that the ancients did not usually shoe their horses. Hence, a hard, solid hoof would add greatly to the value of a horse. The prophet here means, that their horses would be prepared for any fatigue, or any expedition; see a full description of horses and chariots in Bochart&rsquo;s &ldquo;Hieroz.&rdquo; P. i. lib. ii. ch. viii. ix. <\/p> <p> <em>And their wheels like a whirlwind <\/em>&mdash;That is, the wheels of their chariots shall be swift as the wind, and they shall raise a cloud of dust like a whirlwind. This comparison was very common, as it is now; see &ldquo;Bochart.&rdquo; See, also, a magnificent description of a war-horse in <a class=\"ref\">Job 39:19-25<\/a>. <\/p> ",
