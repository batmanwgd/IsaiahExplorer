The first step in that process is to acknowledge one&rsquo;s transgressions, offenses, sins, and iniquities (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzgwXQ==\">Isaiah 6:10<\/a>). But when backtracking in one&rsquo;s relationship with Jehovah leads to hypocritical worship and the loss of spiritual light, predatory activities tend to supplant keeping Jehovah&rsquo;s law and word that are the terms of his covenant. And when things reach that point the road back to Jehovah is long, hard, and painful (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODg5MSI6OH0=\">Isaiah 64:5-12<\/a>). <\/p> ",
