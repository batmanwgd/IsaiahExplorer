The God whom the priests served had been blasphemed, and the very temple was threatened, and it was proper that the priests should go with the habiliments of mourning.<\/p><p><em>Unto Isaiah<\/em>&mdash;It was customary on occasions of danger to consult prophets, as those who had direct communication with God, and seek counsel from them. Thus Balak sent messengers to Balaam to consult him in a time of perplexity (<a class=\"ref\">Numbers 22:5<\/a> ff); thus Jehoshaphat and the king of Israel consulted Micaiah in time of danger from Syria <a class=\"ref\">1 Kings 22:1-13<\/a> ; thus Ahaziah, when sick, sent to consult Elijah <a class=\"ref\">2 Kings 1:1-9<\/a> ; and thus Josiah sent an embassage to Huldah the prophetess to inquire in regard to the book which was found in the temple of the Lord <a class=\"ref\">2 Kings 22:14<\/a>)<\/p>",
