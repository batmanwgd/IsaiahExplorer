Which very probably happened to Belshazzar, when his people had neither opportunity nor heart to bestow an honourable interment upon him, and the conquerors would not suffer them to do it. Like\u2014Like a rotten twig of a tree, which he that prunes the trees, casts away. Raiment\u2014Which, being mangled, and besmeared with mire, and blood, was cast away with contempt. Go down\u2014Who being slain, are cast into some pit. He saith, to the stones of the pit, because when dead bodies are cast in thither, men use to throw an heap of stones upon them. Trodden\u2014Neglected, like such a carcase. And this might literally happen to Belshazzar's dead body.",
