Either he has been defeated by the Babylonian gods, or he has been defeated by our sin. While both issues are addressed in chapters 41\u201347, the primary focus is on demonstrating that the gods have not defeated God in the slightest degree. With the announcement of judgment on Babylon, that argument has come to its climax. But will the exiles believe the promises that have been given to them, or will they give up their faith along the way so that when the prophecies of deliverance are fulfilled, there will be none left to act on them?<\/p>     <p>\u2003Clearly, Isaiah, looking at his own experience (cf. 48:8), sees that as a real possibility. So this chapter is a stirring call to faith. Words for hearing occur ten times in this chapter as the prophet reminds the people that it is because they have not listened in the past that they are in their present condition; he then admonishes them to listen to the promises now that they are in exile.<\/p>     ",
