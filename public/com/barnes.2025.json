    "html": "<p><em>Shall I bring to the birth?<\/em> &mdash;The sense of this verse is plain. It is, that God would certainly accomplish what he had here predicted, and for which he had made ample arrangements and preparations. He would not commence the work, and then abandon it. The figure which is used here is obvious; but one which does not render very ample illustration proper. Jarchi has well expressed it: &lsquo;Num ego adducerem uxorem meam ad sellam partus, sc. ad partitudinem, et non aperirem uterum ejus, ut foetum suum in lucem produceret? Quasi diceret; an ego incipiam rem nec possim eam perficere?&rsquo;<\/p><p><em>Shall I cause to bring forth?<\/em> &mdash;Lowth and Noyes render this, &lsquo;Shall I, who begat, restrain the birth?&rsquo; This accurately expresses the idea. The meaning of the whole is, that God designed the great and sudden increase of his church; that the plan was long laid; and that, having done this, he would not abandon it, but would certainly effect his designs.<\/p> ",
