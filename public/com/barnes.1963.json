    "html": " <p>I have trodden the wine-press alone&mdash;I, Yahweh, have indeed trod the wine-press of my wrath, and I have done it alone (compare the notes at <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODMwOSI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 34:5-6<\/a>). The idea here is, that he had completely destroyed his foes in Idumea, and had done it by a great slaughter. <\/p> <p> <em>For I will tread <\/em>&mdash;Or rather, I trod them. It refers to what he had done; or what was then past. <\/p> <p> <em>And their blood shall be sprinkled <\/em>&mdash;Or rather, their blood was sprinkled. The word used here (\u05e0\u05e6\u05d7 ne\u0304tsach) does not commonly mean blood; but splendor, glory, purity, truth, perpetuity, eternity. Gesenius derives the word, as used here, from an Arabic word meaning to sprinkle, to scatter; and hence, the juice or liquor of the grape as it is sprinkled or spirted from grapes when trodden. There is no doubt here that it refers to blood&mdash;though with the idea of its being spirted out by treading down a foe. <\/p> <p> <em>And I will stain all my raiment <\/em>&mdash;I have stained all my raiment&mdash;referring to the fact that the slaughter was extensive and entire. On the extent of the slaughter, see the notes at <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgzMTAiOjJ9LHsiMTgzMTMiOjJ9XQ==\">Isaiah 34:6-7, Isaiah 34:9-10<\/a>. <\/p> ",
