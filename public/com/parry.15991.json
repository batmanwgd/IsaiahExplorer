Many are called to come unto Christ and receive his power and blessings, but few are chosen to receive all he offers (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 95:5; 121:34<\/a>).

The new name might be <i>Christian<\/i> rather than <i>Israelite.<\/i> Or, in our dispensation, the name could be The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. To that name, as Israel increases in holiness and harmony, will be added another name, Zion (1:26- 27).<\/p> ",
