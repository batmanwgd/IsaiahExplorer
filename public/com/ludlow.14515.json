    "html": " <p>In one of his more famous passages, Isaiah condemns the wicked Israelite women for their vanity and excess. With a series of composite parallelisms, he verbally paints a vivid picture of richly dressed women of the night. He lists their many physical adornments and embellishments, stressing the overabundance of material goods valued by these spiritually blind women. They are preoccupied with necklaces, earrings, bracelets, hats, headbands, curlers, coats, and scarves of fine materials&mdash;expensive fashions that the world still adores.<\/p> <p>With climactic parallelism, Isaiah then describes the Israelite women&rsquo;s fate: their &ldquo;sweet smell&rdquo; become &ldquo;stink,&rdquo; their fancy clothes turn into rags, their &ldquo;well set hair&rdquo; changes to &ldquo;baldness,&rdquo; their fine clothing (&ldquo;stomachers&rdquo;) becomes &ldquo;sackcloth,&rdquo; and their beauty turns into scars (v. 24). The irony of this downfall climaxes in the last verses of the chapter as the once proud and haughty daughters of Zion sit upon the ground as slaves in desolation and poverty.<\/p> ",
