    "html": "<p> In <em> strophe<\/em> 3 he now describes how Jehovah promised him help, how this promise put new life into him, and how it was fulfilled, and turned his sufferings into salvation. <\/p><p><em> \u201cWhat shall I say, that He promised me, and He hath carried it out: <\/em><\/p><p><em> I should walk quietly all my years, on the trouble of my soul?! <\/em><\/p><p><em> 'O Lord, by such things men revive, and the life of my spirit is always therein: <\/em><\/p><p><em> And so wilt Thou restore me, and make me to live!' <\/em><\/p><p><em> Behold, bitterness became salvation to me, bitterness; <\/em><\/p><p><em> And Thou, Thou hast delivered my soul in love out of the pit of destruction <\/em><\/p><p><em> For Thou hast cast all my sins behind Thy back.\u201d <\/em><\/p><p> The question, \u201cWhat shall I say?\u201d is to be understood as in <a class=\"ref\">2 Samuel 7:20<\/a>, viz., What shall I say, to thank Him for having promised me, and carried out His promise? The <em> Vav<\/em> in \u05d5\u05d0\u05de\u05e8 introduces the statement of his reason (Ges. \u00a7155, 1,<em> c<\/em> ). On \u05d4\u05d3\u05bc\u05d3\u05bc\u05d4 (= \u05d4\u05ea\u05d3\u05bc\u05d3\u05bc\u05d4 ), from \u05d3\u05bc\u05d3\u05d4 (= \u05d3\u05bc\u05d0\u05d3\u05d0 ), see at <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 42:5<\/a>. The future here, in  , gives the purpose of God concerning him. He was to walk (referring to the walk of life, not the walk to the temple) gently (without any disturbance) all his years upon the trouble of his soul, i.e., all the years that followed upon it, the years that were added to his life. This is the true explanation of \u05e2\u05dc , as in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4Mzk2LDE4MjcwLDMxOTRd\">Isaiah 38:5; Isaiah 32:10; Leviticus 15:25<\/a>; not \u201cin spite of\u201d (Ewald), or \u201cwith,\u201d as in <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 31:24; Jeremiah 6:14<\/a>, where it forms an adverb. A better rendering than this would be \u201cfor,\u201d or \u201con account of,\u201d i.e., in humble salutary remembrance of the way in which God by His free grace averted the danger of death. What follows in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDA3XQ==\">Isaiah 38:16<\/a> can only be regarded in connection with the petition in  , as Hezekiah's reply to the promise of God, which had been communicated to him by the prophet. Consequently the neuters \u05e2\u05dc\u05d9\u05d4\u05dd and \u05d1\u05bc\u05d4\u05df( dna (cf., <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODg5MCwxMzQxMV0seyIyMTI5OSI6Mn1d\">Isaiah 64:4; Job 22:21; Ezekiel 33:18-19<\/a>) refer to the gracious words and gracious acts of God. These are the true support of life ( \u05e2\u05dc as in <a class=\"ref\">Deuteronomy 8:3<\/a>) for every man, and in these does the life of his spirit consist, i.e., his inmost and highest source of life, and that \u201con all sides\u201d ( \u05dc\u05db\u05dc , which it would be more correct to point \u05dc\u05db\u05bc\u05dc , as in <a class=\"ref\">1 Chronicles 7:5<\/a>; cf., <em> bakko\u0304l <\/em> , in every respect, <a class=\"ref\">2 Samuel 23:5<\/a>). With this explanation, the conjecture of Ewald and Knobel, that the reading should be \u05e8\u05d5\u05bc\u05d7\u05d5 , falls to the ground. From the general truth of which he had made a personal application, that the word of God is the source of all life, he drew this conclusion, which he here repeats with a retrospective glance, \u201cSo wilt Thou then make me whole (see the <em> kal<\/em> in <a class=\"ref\">Job 39:4<\/a>), and keep me alive\u201d (for \u05d5\u05ea\u05d7\u05d9\u05e0\u05d9 ; with the hope passing over into a prayer). The praise for the fulfilment of the promise commences with the word <em> hinne\u0304h <\/em> (behold). His severe illness had been sent in anticipation of a happy deliverance (on the radical signification of <em> mar <\/em> , which is here doubled, to give it a superlative force, see <em> Comm. on Job<\/em> , at <a class=\"ref\">Job 16:2-5<\/a>). The Lord meant it for good; the suffering was indeed a chastisement, but it was a chastisement of love. Casting all his sins behind Him, as men do with things which they do not wish to know, or have no desire to be reminded of (compare e.g., <a class=\"ref\">Nehemiah 9:26<\/a>), He \u201cloved him out,\u201d i.e., drew him lovingly out, of the pit of destruction (<em> c ha\u0302shaq <\/em> , love as a firm inward bond; <em> b e l\u0131\u0304 <\/em> , which is generally used as a particle, stands here in its primary substantive signification, from <em> ba\u0302la\u0302h <\/em> , to consume).<\/p>",
