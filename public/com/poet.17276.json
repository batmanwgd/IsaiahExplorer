(NJV)<\/p> <\/blockquote><p>After purging the imperfections of her inhabitants, the Lord will restore Jerusalem as a righteous city with trustworthy leaders. And as promised in verse 27, he will save Zion with justice and the repentant converts with retribution (or righteousness, KJV). It will be a marvelous time when the Lord and his people (Zion, or the pure in heart) will be established in judgment and righteousness upon the earth. It will be a time of peace and joy for many, though some will instead suffer the consequences described by Isaiah in the last verses of chapter 1.<\/p>",
