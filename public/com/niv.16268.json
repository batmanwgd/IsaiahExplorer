Particularly in Isaiah 50\u201352 this ability to restore his people, and indeed all people, to himself is referred to as \u201cthe arm\u201d of the Lord, an image of his incomparable power (50:2; 51:5, 9; 52:10). So we, the readers, are brought to a fever pitch of anticipation, particularly by the final call in 52:11\u201312 to leave the unclean and go out from bondage, both led by and followed by the Lord. Clearly, the \u201carm of the L<small>ORD<\/small>\u201d is about to be revealed.<\/p>     <p>\u2003We have had some hints about this arm in 42:1\u20136; 49:1\u20136; and 50:4\u20139, where God in each case promises to deliver not only his own people but the entire world by means of his obedient Servant. However, there have been increasingly disturbing overtones in these passages. They have not sounded like paeans of victory. To be sure, ultimate victory is promised, but it does not seem to be through smashing conquest. Rather, it is through an obedient revelation of God in the midst of rejection and abuse.<\/p>     <p>\u2003Those overtones are now amply confirmed in 52:13\u201353:12. The arm of the Lord looks nothing like our stereotypical conquering hero. Especially after the exultant tone of 52:7\u201312, the somber notes of the present passage come as a shock. But that means that this section is in this place on purpose. To suggest it is here by accident or because of some obscure word association with the preceding or the following strains credulity beyond the breaking point. Someone, whether author or editor, was trying to make a point by placing this poem between the material of chapter 52 and that of chapter 54. That point is clearly to demonstrate an instrumental relationship between 52:13\u2013 53:12 and what both precedes it and follows it. Who is the mighty arm of the Lord (49:1\u201352:12) who makes possible the glorious invitations found in chapters 54 and 55? By what means is the alienation of sin overcome? The arm of the Lord is the ideal Servant\u2014Israel as he was meant to be.<\/p>     <p>\u2003This poem is divided into five stanzas of three verses each. It moves from an introduction (52:13\u201315) to the Servant\u2019s rejection (53:1\u20133) to his carrying of \u201cour\u201d sins and transgressions (53:4\u20136) to the results of that carrying (53:7\u20139) to a revelation of the atoning nature of the carrying (53:10\u201312). This careful structuring demonstrates both the care with which the prophet approaches this particular statement and the importance he attaches to it.<\/p>     ",
