Remember the beginning from the olden time, that I am God, and none else: Deity, and absolutely none like me: proclaiming the issue from the beginning, and from ancient times what has not yet taken place, saying, My counsel shall stand, and all my good pleasure I carry out: calling a bird of prey from the east, the man of my counsel from a distant land: not only have I spoken, I also bring it; I have purposed it, I also execute it.\u201d<\/i> The object to which \u201cthis\u201d points back is the nothingness of idols and idolatry.

They are to pass before their minds the earlier history, and indeed \u201cfrom the olden time.\u201d \u201c<i> Remember:<\/i> \u201d<i> (<span class=\"translit\"> zikhru\u0304<\/span>) is connected with the accusative of the object of remembrance, and<span class=\"normal hebrew\"> \ufb3b\u05d9<\/span> points to its result. An earnest and thoughtful study of history would show them that Jehovah alone was<i> (<span class=\"translit\"> El<\/span>), the absolutely Mighty One, and<i> (<span class=\"translit\"> 'Elo\u0304h\u0131\u0304m<\/span>), the Being who united in Himself all divine majesty by which reverence was evoked. The participles in<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NTk3XQ==\">Isaiah 46:10<\/a> ,<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NTk4XQ==\">Isaiah 46:11<\/a> are attached to the \u201cI\u201d of<span class=\"normal hebrew\"> \ufb3b\u05de\u05d5\u05e0\u05d9<\/span> . It is Jehovah, the Incomparable, who has now, as at other times from the very commencement of the new turn in history, predicted the issue of which it would lead, and<i> (<span class=\"translit\"> miqqedem<\/span>), i.e., long before, predicted things that have not yet occurred, and which therefore lit outside the sphere of human combination - another passage like<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDc4XQ==\">Isaiah 41:26<\/a> ;<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NTgzXQ==\">Isaiah 45:21<\/a> , etc., in which what is predicted in these prophecies lays claim to the character of a prediction of long standing, and not of one merely uttered a few years before.

The east is Persis (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDU0XQ==\">Isaiah 41:2<\/a>); and the distant land, the northern part of Media (as in<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3OTEyXQ==\">Isaiah 13:5<\/a>).

This name for the eagle is traceable, like (<span class=\"translit\"> avid<\/span>), to a root (<span class=\"translit\"> va\u0302<\/span>), to move with the swiftness of the wind. This was shown by Passow, compare Kuhn's Zeitschrift, i. 29, where we also find at 10, 126 another but less probable derivation from a root i, to go (compare (<span class=\"translit\"> eva<\/span>), a course).)<\/p> \n\n\n\n<p>just as in<a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 49:22<\/a> and<a class=\"ref\">Ezekiel 17:3<\/a> Nebuchadnezzar is called a (<span class=\"translit\"> nesher<\/span>).

Instead of<span class=\"normal hebrew\"> \u05e2\u05e6\u05ea\u05d5<\/span><span class=\"normal hebrew\"> \u05d0\u05d9\u05e9\u05c1<\/span> , the keri reads more clearly, though quite unnecessarily, (<span class=\"normal hebrew\"> \u05e2\u05e6\u05ea\u05d9<\/span><span class=\"normal hebrew\"> \u05d0\u05d9\u05e9\u05c1<\/span> (see e.g.,<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NTYwXQ==\">Isaiah 44:26<\/a>). The correlate<span class=\"normal hebrew\"> \u05d0\u05e3<\/span> (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NTk4XQ==\">Isaiah 46:11<\/a>), which is only attached to the second verb the second time, affirms that Jehovah does not only the one, but the other also. His word is made by Him into a deed, His idea into a reality.<span class=\"normal hebrew\"> \u05d9\u05e6\u05e8<\/span> is a word used particularly by Isaiah, to denote the ideal preformation of the future in the mind of God (cf.,<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MDY0XQ==\">Isaiah 22:11<\/a> ;<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4Mzc5XQ==\">Isaiah 37:26<\/a>). The feminine suffixes refer in a neuter sense to the theme of the prophecy - the overthrow of idolatrous Babel, upon which Cyrus comes down like an eagle, in the strength of Jehovah. So far we have the nota bene for those who are inclined to apostasy. They are to lay to heart the nothingness of the heathen gods, and, on the other hand, the self-manifestation of Jehovah from the olden time, that is to say, of the One God who is now foretelling and carrying out the destruction of the imperial city through the eagle from the east.<br><\/p> ",
