    "html": "<p> (28) In the year that king Ahaz died was this burden.\u2014The prophecies against Babylon and Assyria are naturally followed by a series of like predictions, dealing with other nations which played their part in the great drama of the time. The date of that which comes next in order is obviously specified, either by Isaiah himself or by the compiler of his prophecies, that it might be seen that it was not a prophecy after the event. The death-year of Ahaz was B.C. 727. It was natural that the prophet\u2019s thoughts should be much exercised then, as in the year of Uzziah\u2019s death (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzcxXQ==\">Isaiah 6:1<\/a>), on the uncertainties of the coming future, and the \u201cburden\u201d was the answer to his searchings of heart. It was probably delivered before the king\u2019s death. (See Note on<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzcxXQ==\">Isaiah 6:1<\/a> .)<\/p> ",
