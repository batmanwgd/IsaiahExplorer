And here <i>the sieve of vanity <\/i>is such a one as doth not separate the chaff in order to save the corn, but makes an entire riddance, as when chaff is scattered before the wind.\u201d Bishop Lowth translates the clause, <i>To toss the nations with the van of perdition, <\/i>judging that  <span class=\"hebrew_text\">\u05e0\u05e4\u05d4<\/span>rather signifies a <i>van <\/i>than a sieve, and observing from Kimchi, \u201cThe use of the van is to cleanse the corn from the chaff and straw: but the van with which God will winnow the nations, will be the van of emptiness or perdition; for nothing useful shall remain behind, but all shall come to nothing, and perish. In like manner <i>a bridle <\/i>is designed to guide the horse in the right way; but the bridle which God will put in the jaws of the people, shall not direct them aright, but shall make them err, and lead them into destruction.\u201d<\/p>",
