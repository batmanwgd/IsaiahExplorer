The Persians were expert bowmen, as appears from <a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 49:35<\/a>, and from Strabo\u2019s testimony. <i>With chariots of men and horsemen <\/i>\u2014As some of them fought on foot, so others from chariots and horses. <i>And Kir <\/i>\u2014That is, the Medes, so called, from an eminent city and region of that name in Media, <a class=\"ref\">2 Kings 16:9; Amos 1:5<\/a>; <i>uncovered the shield <\/i>\u2014Prepared their defensive and offensive weapons, and themselves, for the battle; for in times of peace arms were wrapped up and covered, to preserve them clean and fit for use. <i>Thy choicest valleys shall be full of chariots <\/i>\u2014Valleys were the most proper places for the use of chariots; <i>and the horsemen at the gate <\/i>\u2014To assist and defend the footmen, while they made the assault, and to prevent those who endeavoured to escape. <\/p>",
