    "html": "<p>Just as a temple was built to Israel&rsquo;s God in ancient Egypt by &eacute;migr&eacute; Israelites, so one is built &ldquo;in the midst&rdquo; of end-time Egypt, its &ldquo;altar&rdquo; denoting both atonement for transgression and consecrated offerings. A &ldquo;monument&rdquo; at Egypt&rsquo;s border suggests a memorial erected by Jehovah&rsquo;s people who dwelt there. Their serving as a &ldquo;sign&rdquo; and &ldquo;testimony&rdquo; reflects these persons enduring loyalty in spite of their falling victim to injustices at the hands of oppressors. Just as Jehovah sent Moses in answer to his people&rsquo;s cries in ancient Egypt (<a class=\"ref\">Exodus 3:1-9<\/a>), so he sends them a &ldquo;savior&rdquo;&mdash;his end-time servant.<\/p> ",
