    "html": "<p><i> I will declare thy righteousness.<\/i> The Prophet affirms that the Lord will no longer endure what he formerly endured, and that henceforth he must follow a different method. He calls it ironically \u201ctheir righteousness;\u201c for he means by it all the wickedness and all the errors by which they were stained and corrupted; as if he had said, \u201cI will show what is the nature of your righteousness.\u201d So long as God \u201cholds his peace,\u201d they who are most unrighteous and most unholy appear to be \u201crighteous\u201d persons; but when the Lord ascends his judgment-seat, men are brought out of their lurking\u00adplaces, and their baseness is dragged forth to public view. And so the Prophet means that the greatest wickedness passes in the world for \u201crighteousness,\u201d so long as God holds his peace, but that it shall at length be scattered, when he ascends his judgment\u00adseat; for men, after having much and long flattered themselves, shall at length feel that he is their judge.<\/p> \n<p><i> And they shall not profit thee.<\/i> This relates to the effect, by which men almost always judge; for they do not inquire whether a thing be righteous or unrighteous, but think that whatever is profitable to them ought to be approved. The Prophet therefore threatens that all the works from which they hoped to derive some profit shall be destructive to them.<\/p> ",
