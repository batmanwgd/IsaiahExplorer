    "html": " <p>Chapters 24-27 comprise what scholars call the Isaiah Apocalypse&mdash;a prophecy dealing with the end of the world. In all respects, however, these chapters, together with their parallel counterpart, form a continuum of Isaiah&rsquo;s development of prophetic concepts in Part V of Isaiah&rsquo;s Seven-Part Structure (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODYxNiI6MTI2fQ==\">Isaiah 24-27; 48-54 <\/a>). Five Songs of Salvation (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgxMDkiOjR9LHsiMTgxMjAiOjV9LFsxODEyOF0seyIxODEzMiI6Nn0seyIxODE1NCI6NX1d\">Isaiah 24:13-16; 25:1-5, 9; 26:1-6; 27:2-6 <\/a>) interject predictions of doom for the world. Nuancing Isaiah&rsquo;s vision of Greater Babylon, particularly its cosmic destruction (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzkxNiI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 13:9-10 <\/a>), chapter 24 portrays a tragic desolation of the earth and its inhabitants. <\/p> ",
