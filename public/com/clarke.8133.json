They that indulged in feasting and drinking shall perish with hunger and thirst; and Hades shall indulge his appetite as much as they had done, and devour them all. The image is strong and expressive in the highest degree. <a class=\"ref\">Habakkuk 2:5<\/a>, uses the same image with great force:\u2014the ambitious and avaricious conqueror. <\/p>\n\n <p>\"Enlargeth his appetite like Hades; <\/p>\n\n <p>And he is like Death, and will never be satisfied,\" <\/p>\n\n <p>But, in Isaiah, Hades is introduced to much greater advantage, in person; and placed before our eyes in the form of a ravenous monster, opening wide his immeasurable jaws, and swallowing them all together: \"Therefore Shoel hath dilated her soul, she hath opened her mouth beyond limit.\" Destruction expects more than a common meal, when God visits Jerusalem for her iniquities. This seems to refer to the ruin brought on the Jews by the Romans. Our blessed Lord repeats this parable, and applies it to this very transaction, <a class=\"ref\">Matthew 21:33<\/a>. <\/p>",
