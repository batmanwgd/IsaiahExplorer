    "html": "<p>Not all people, of course, are wicked, and those who are not will be saved from the destroying fire&mdash;both the spiritual (hell) and the physical (see <a class=\"ref\">1 Nephi 22:15&ndash;17<\/a>). The names of the children of the Lord who have kept their covenants are enrolled in a special book known as &ldquo;the book of the Lord&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 34:16<\/a>), &ldquo;the book of the law of God&rdquo; (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 85:5<\/a>; see also <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MzEzLDE4MzE1XQ==\">vv. 9, 11<\/a>), or &ldquo;the book of life&rdquo; (<a class=\"ref\">Revelation 20:12<\/a>). Records of our works are kept on earth by the Lord&rsquo;s clerks, but the book of life is the record kept in heaven. Both records should agree (see <a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 128:6&ndash;9<\/a>). Of those whose names are recorded in the heavenly book, &ldquo;no one of these shall fail&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 34:16<\/a>). The promise that &ldquo;none shall want [lack] their mate&rdquo; (<a class=\"ref\">JST, Isaiah 34:16<\/a>) is particularly interesting to Latter-day Saints since we know that only through the ordinance of celestial marriage can we have our mate eternally.<\/p><p class=\"cite\">LDS Church Educational System Old Testament Student Manual, 1 Kings&ndash;Malachi, Religion 302, Chapter 15, Item 28<\/p>",
