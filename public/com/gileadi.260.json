Jehovah desires to provide for those fleeing from the bared <em>sword <\/em> and drawn <em>bow <\/em>&mdash;from the king of Assyria\/Babylon&rsquo;s invasion of their lands&mdash;through the charity of others more fortunate than themselves whom he tests thereby. Besides Jehovah&rsquo;s elect, many honorable people among the earth&rsquo;s inhabitants, who &ldquo;look to the forest home as protection&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MDYxXQ==\">Isaiah 22:8<\/a>), too, may yet survive (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODk0MSI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 66:18-19<\/a>). <\/p> ",
