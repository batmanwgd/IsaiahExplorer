    "html": "<p> The prophecy now takes a step backward in the domain of the future, and describes the manner in which the children of Zion get back to their home. <em> \u201cThus saith the Lord Jehovah, Behold, I lift up my hand to nations, and set up my standard to peoples: and they bring thy sons in their bosom; and thy daughters, upon shoulders are they carried.\u201d<\/em> The setting up of a standard (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzY2LDE3ODk3LDE4MDAxXQ==\">Isaiah 5:26; Isaiah 11:12; Isaiah 18:3<\/a>, cf., <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODY1XQ==\">Isaiah 62:10<\/a>) is a favourite figure with Isaiah, as well as swaying the hand.
