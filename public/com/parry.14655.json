As in Isaiah's time (see 3:1- 12), today wicked people from all walks of life speak evil things against the Lord and oppress their neighbors and others; even youngsters \"behave&hellip;proudly\" and speak out against the elderly (3:5). Many of the leaders are not without guilt, for they cause their people \"to err\" (3:12).<\/i><\/p> <p><i>We, the Lord's people of today, are not always innocent of the transgressions listed in Isaiah's words concerning the \"daughters of Zion\" (3:13-4:1), for we also set our hearts on material goods: designer clothes, luxuries, and wealth.<\/i><\/p> ",
