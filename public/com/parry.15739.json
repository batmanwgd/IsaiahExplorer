They symbolize the covenant people.<\/p> <p><i>beautiful garments.<\/i> Israel is to replace her slave garments with beautiful garments, perhaps the garments of royalty or the holy garments of the temple. One of the ways in which Zion puts on her beautiful garments is through the law of consecration (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 82:14-20<\/a>). <\/p> <p><i>uncircumcised\/unclean.<\/i> These words refer to the disobedient, sinners, or disbelieving Gentiles. Such will not be found in Zion.<\/p> ",
