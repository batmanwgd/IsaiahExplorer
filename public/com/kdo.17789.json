    "html": "<p> The coming Davidic king is peace for Israel, but for Philistia death. <em> \u201cAnd the poorest of the poor will feed, and needy ones lie down in peace; and I kill thy root through hunger, and he slays thy remnant.\u201d<\/em> \u201cThe poorest of the poor:\u201d <em> b e co\u0304re\u0304 dallim <\/em> is an intensified expression for <em> b e ne\u0304 dallim <\/em> , the latter signifying such as belong to the family of the poor, the former (cf., <a class=\"ref\">Job 18:13<\/a>, <em> mors dirissima<\/em> ) such as hold the foremost rank in such a family - a description of Israel, which, although at present deeply, very deeply, repressed and threatened on every side, would then enjoy its land in quietness and peace (<a class=\"ref\">Zephaniah 3:12-13<\/a>). In this sense \u05d5\u05e8\u05e2\u05d5\u05bc is used absolutely; and there is no necessity for Hupfeld's conjecture (<em> Ps<\/em> . ii. 258), that we should read \u05d1\u05db\u05e8\u05d9 (in my pastures). Israel rises again, but Philistia perishes even to a root and remnant; and the latter again falls a victim on the one hand to the judgment of God (famine), and on the other to the punishment inflicted by the house of David. The change of persons in  is no synallage; but the subject to <em> yaharo\u0304g <\/em> (slays) is the basilisk, the father of the flying dragon. The first strophe of the <em> massah <\/em> terminates here. It consists of eight lines, each of the two Masoretic <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3OTU4LDE3OTU5XQ==\">Isaiah 14:29, Isaiah 14:30<\/a> containing four clauses.<\/p>",
