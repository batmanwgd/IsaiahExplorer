These were ranged in order upon the walls of the armory, (see<a class=\"ref\">Song of Solomon 4:4<\/a> ;), upon pins worked into the walls on purpose, as above mentioned. Eliakim is considered as a principal stake of this sort, immovably fastened in the wall for the support of all vessels destined for common or sacred uses; that is, as the principal support of the whole civil and ecclesiastical polity. And the consequence of his continued power will be the promotion and flourishing condition of his family and dependents, from the highest to the lowest.<\/p> \n\n<p><em>Vessels of flagons \"Meaner vessels\"\u2014<\/em><span class=\"greek-hebrew\"> \u05e0\u05d1\u05dc\u05d9\u05dd<\/span><span class=\"translit\"> nebalim<\/span> seems to mean earthen vessels of common use, brittle, and of little value, (see<a class=\"ref\">Lamentations 4:2; Jeremiah 48:12<\/a> ;), in opposition to<span class=\"greek-hebrew\"> \u05d0\u05d2\u05e0\u05d5\u05ea<\/span><span class=\"translit\"> aganoth<\/span> , goblets of gold and silver used in the sacrifices.<a class=\"ref\">Exodus 24:6<\/a> .<\/p> ",
