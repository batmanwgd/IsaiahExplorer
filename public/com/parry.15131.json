Thus the great feast identified in this section will take place in the New Jerusalem.<\/p> <p><i>feast of fat things, a feast of wines.<\/i> By teaching the gospel to the earth's inhabitants, our missionaries invite people to come to this feast, also called \"the supper of the Lord\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 58:11<\/a>), the \"supper of the house of the Lord\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 58:9<\/a>), and the \"marriage supper of the Lamb\" (<a class=\"ref\">Rev. 19:9<\/a>). \"All nations\" are invited\u2014\"first, the rich and the learned, the wise and the noble\"\u2014but when these reject the invitation to the feast, the Lord's representatives will invite the poor and the humble. Only those who have received the ordinances of the temple and who are truly the humble followers of Christ will be able to partake of the feast. This feast will take place at or near the time of the Second Coming (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 58:9-11; Rev. 19:7-8<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\">Matt. 22:2-14; Luke 14:16-24<\/a>). <\/p> <p><i>fat things full of marrow. <\/i>The feast, like the sacramental emblems, reminds us of Christ's atonement, for <i>fat things<\/i> and wines recall sacrificial offerings (<a class=\"ref\">Lev. 3:3-16<\/a>) these things also imply abundance and bounty. The phrase <i>wines on the lees well refined<\/i> speaks of \"wine that remains upon its settlings until it is well matured. It is then poured off and strained to provide the best wine possible,\" since only the very best will be served at the Lord's feast.<\/p> ",
