    "html": "<p>Jehovah&rsquo;s people who are here addressed are chronically delusional to the point of slumbering in a deep sleep. Having procrastinated the day of their salvation by buying into dreamlike deceptions and fantasies, they grow &ldquo;bewildered&rdquo; and &ldquo;cry for help&rdquo; when Jehovah&rsquo;s judgments come upon them. As a people&rsquo;s leaders generally reflect the people themselves, so all are spiritually &ldquo;drunk&rdquo; and &ldquo;stagger&rdquo; instead of walking straight. The prophets and seers&mdash;the people&rsquo;s &ldquo;eyes&rdquo; and &ldquo;heads&rdquo;&mdash;can&rsquo;t awaken them to spiritual realities because they themselves are intoxicated and asleep (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 28:7; 56:9-12<\/a>).<\/p>",
