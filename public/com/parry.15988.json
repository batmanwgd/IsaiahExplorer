If Israel is going to turn to pagan gods, the Lord is saying, I will <i>destine<\/i> you to destruction by <i>sword. <\/i>And if Israel is going to bow down to pagan gods, the Lord says, I will yet cause you to <i>bow down<\/i> to be killed.<\/p> <p> <i>bow down.<\/i> Those who do not choose the Lord will be destroyed, perhaps by bowing or kneeling for execution.<\/p> <p><i>when I called.<\/i> When the Lord called the people to repentance, they ignored him and chose a different way (50:2; 65:1-2). Such divine calls generally come through the prophets, through the whisperings of the Spirit, or through our consciences (or the light of Christ).<\/p> <p><i>did evil before mine eyes.<\/i> The Lord is underscoring the fact that all their evil doings, though they may have been done in secret, were done before him. Nothing can be hid from the Lord; he sees and knows all we do, both good and evil.<\/p> <p><i>did choose that wherein I delighted not.<\/i> This statement is an understatement. The Lord is speaking to a people who worship idols, who will not hearken to him, who \"did evil before mine eyes.\" Not only did he not delight in their works but he truly hated them. Yet this phrase reminds us not to be lukewarm in our obedience to the Lord; we should seek to delight him by our choices.<\/p> ",
