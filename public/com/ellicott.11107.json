    "html": " <p>,(22) And the key of the house of David will I lay upon his shoulder . . .\u2014The key of the king\u2019s treasure-chambers and of the gates of the palace was the natural symbol of the chamberlain\u2019s or vizier\u2019s office, and, as in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODM2XQ==\">Isaiah 9:6<\/a>, it was solemnly laid upon the shoulder of the new official, perhaps as representing the burden of the responsibilities of the duties of his office. In the \u201ckeys of the kingdom of heaven,\u201d in <a class=\"ref\">Matthew 16:19<\/a>, and again in <a class=\"ref\">Revelation 3:7<\/a>, as also in the custom of admitting a Rabbi to his office by giving him a key, we have a reproduction of the same emblem. <\/p>\n <p>So he shall open, and none shall shut . . .\u2014The words paint vividly the supremacy of the office to which Eliakim was to be called. He alone was to decide who was to be admitted into the king\u2019s chamber, and for whom the king\u2019s treasury was to be opened. In <a class=\"ref\">Revelation 3:7<\/a>, the symbolism is reproduced in its higher application to the King of kings. <\/p>",
