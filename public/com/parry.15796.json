    "html": " <p>The first passage of chapter 55 emphasizes the free gift of salvation, which is offered to all (55:1-3). This later passage (55:6-9) teaches us what we must do to receive the proffered gift:<\/p> <p>Seek the Lord (55:6).<\/p> <p>Call upon him (55:6).<\/p> <p>Forsake our wicked way of living (55:7).<\/p> <p>Forsake the thoughts and reasoning that lead to the wicked way of life (55:7).<\/p> <p>Having turned <i>from<\/i> sin, now turn <i>to<\/i> the Lord (55:7).<\/p> <p>In response, the Lord will experience a <i>feeling<\/i> of mercy and then take the <i>action<\/i> of granting us pardon (55:7). He will treat us with such loving-kindness because, in his perfection, his thoughts and ways are far above ours, as far as the \"heavens are higher than the earth\" (55:8-9).<\/p> <blockquote><i>Seek<\/i> ye <i>the<\/i> <i>Lord<\/i> while <u>he may be found<\/u>,     <br><i>call ye upon him<\/i> <u>while he is near<\/u>: (55:6)     <br>Let the <i>wicked<\/i> forsake his <u>way<\/u>,     <br>and the <i>unrighteous man<\/i> his <u>thoughts<\/u>:     <br>and let him return <i>unto the Lord,<\/i> and he will <u>have mercy<\/u> upon him;     <br>and <i>to our God,<\/i> for he will <u>abundantly pardon<\/u>. (55:7)     <br>For <i>my<\/i> <i>thoughts<\/i><u> are not your thoughts<\/u><i>,<\/i>     <br><u>neither are your ways<\/u><i> my ways,<\/i> saith the Lord. (55:8)     <br>For as the <i>heavens<\/i> are <u>higher than the earth<\/u>,     <br>so are <i>my ways<\/i> <u>higher than your ways<\/u>,     <br>and <i>my thoughts<\/i> than <u>your thoughts<\/u>.
