From harvesting raw materials to finishing the end product, its citizens are engrossed in physical not spiritual realities&mdash;whereas long ago Jehovah had said, &ldquo;You shall not bow down to their gods or serve them, nor do after their works. But you will utterly overthrow them and entirely break down their images. And you will serve Jehovah your God, and he will bless your bread and water. And I will take away sickness from among you&rdquo; (<a class=\"ref\">Exodus 23:24-25<\/a>). <\/p> ",
