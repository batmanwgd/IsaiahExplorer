Of these Assyria was then the most prominent within the horizon of the prophet\u2019s view; but Moab appears in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTI5XQ==\">Isaiah 25:10<\/a>, and the language, with that exception, seems deliberately generalised, as if to paint the general discomfiture in every age (and, above all, in the great age of the future Deliverer) of the enemies of Jehovah and His people. The Hebrew word for \u201cearth\u201d admits (as elsewhere) of the rendering \u201cland\u201d; but here the wider meaning seems to predominate, as in its union with the \u201cworld,\u201d in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTAwXQ==\">Isaiah 24:4<\/a>. <\/p>",
