Bochart observes, from Aristotle, Hist. Animal. lib. 4 that in this kind of animals alone the voice of the female is deeper than that of the male; therefore the lowing of the heifer, rather than of the bullock, is chosen by the prophet, as the more proper image to express the mourning of Moab. But I must add that the expression here is very short and obscure; and the opinions of interpreters are various in regard to the meaning. Compare <a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 48:34<\/a>.<\/p> \n\n<p><em>Shall they go it up \"They shall ascend\"\u2014<\/em> For<span class=\"greek-hebrew\"> \u05d9\u05e2\u05dc\u05d4<\/span><span class=\"translit\"> yaaleh<\/span> , the Septuagint and a MS. read in the plural,<span class=\"greek-hebrew\"> \u05d9\u05e2\u05dc\u05d5<\/span><span class=\"translit\"> yaalu<\/span> .
