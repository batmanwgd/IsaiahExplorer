Those of whom the prophet speaks are the rulers of the great world-empires, who, as in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3OTM4LDIxMjcwXQ==\">Isaiah 14:9; Ezekiel 32:21<\/a> , have passed into the gloomy world of Hades, out of which there was, for them at least, no escape. Their very names should perish from the memories of men. The LXX., adopting another etymology of the word Rephaim, gives the singular rendering, \u201cPhysicians shall not raise them up to life.\u201d<\/p> ",
