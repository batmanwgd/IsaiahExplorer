    "html": " <p>A scribal error very likely accounts for the figure &ldquo;sixty-five years.&rdquo; Historically, Isaiah&rsquo;s prophecy was fulfilled within just a few years. Assyria conquered Aram and Israel during Ahaz&rsquo; reign, so perhaps &ldquo;six or five&rdquo; is closer to Isaiah&rsquo;s prediction. The words &ldquo;capital&rdquo; and &ldquo;head&rdquo; (<em>ro&rsquo;s<\/em>) are identical in Hebrew. A play on words&mdash;&ldquo;You will not believe it, because you are not loyal&rdquo; (<em>&rsquo;im lo&rsquo; ta&rsquo;aminu ki lo&rsquo; te&rsquo;amenu <\/em>)&mdash;reflects Ahaz&rsquo; disloyalty to Jehovah. Jehovah&rsquo;s unconditional covenant with David nonetheless ensures that the northern kings&rsquo; infringing on Ahaz&rsquo; rights will suffer covenant curses. <\/p> ",
