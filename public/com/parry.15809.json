Under the law of Moses, eunuchs were denied full fellowship with the Israelites (<a class=\"ref\">Lev. 21:17-23; Deut. 23:1-2<\/a>) and had no inheritance in Israel because they had no offspring. The Lord promises that they will receive full blessings in the gospel if they will receive and keep his laws. Among these blessings is the Abrahamic covenant, which includes a promise of endless seed.<\/p> <p><i>dry tree.<\/i> A <i>dry<\/i> <i>tree<\/i> is one that cannot bear fruit.
