In <a class=\"ref\">Mosiah 16:1-2<\/a>, Abinadi indicates that this prophecy will be fulfilled at the time of the Second Coming, \"when all shall see the salvation of the Lord.\" President Joseph Fielding Smith taught that those who so bow are not necessarily candidates for celestial glory but also include those who will inherit a terrestrial and telestial glory (<a class=\"ref\">Rom. 14:10-12; Mosiah 27:31<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 76:110-11; 88:104<\/a>). <\/p> ",
