Yet<i>as a teil-tree, and as an oak,<\/i> &c.\u2014Yet there shall be another remnant, not such a one as that which came out of Babylon, but a holy seed, who shall afterward look upon him whom they have pierced, and mourn over him. <i>Whose substance is in them when they cast their leaves,<\/i> &c.\u2014Who, when their leaves are cast in winter, have a substance within themselves, a vital principle, which preserves life in the root of the tree, and in due time sends it forth into all the branches. <i>So the holy seed shall be the substance,<\/i> or, rather, <i>the support thereof<\/i>\u2014Of the people, who, were it not for the sake of these, should be finally rooted out and destroyed.<\/p> ",
