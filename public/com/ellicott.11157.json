With this there probably mingled another, though kindred, thought. The man whose face is thus covered cannot see the light, and the \u201ccovering\u201d represents the veil (<a class=\"ref\">2 Corinthians 3:15<\/a>) which hinders men from knowing God. The final victory of God includes a triumph over ignorance and sorrow, as well as over sin and death. <\/p> ",
