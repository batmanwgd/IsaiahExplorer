In this verse he seems to make a transition into the thanksgiving, which is undoubtedly contained in the following verses, and so the sense is, He hath sent a gracious message to me, by his prophet, concerning the prolongation of my life, and himself hath made good his word. Thus the words are understood by the Chaldee paraphrast, the LXX., and by the Syriac and Arabic interpreters. To this purpose also Bishop Lowth reads the clause. <i>He hath given me a promise, and he hath performed it. I shall go softly all my years <\/i>\u2014I will conduct myself with humble thankfulness to God for conferring so great a favour upon so unworthy a person, as long as I live. I shall never forget my unworthiness and his loving kindness; <i>in the bitterness of my soul <\/i>\u2014That is, or rather, <i>upon, <\/i> or <i>after it: <\/i> or, as the Chaldee paraphrast reads it, <i>because of my deliverance from bitterness of soul. <\/i> <\/p> ",
