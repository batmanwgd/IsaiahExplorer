This the prophet speaks in the persons of the carnal and unbelieving Jews. There was a great deal of true beauty in him, the beauty of holiness, and the beauty of goodness, enough to render him <i>the desire of all nations;<\/i>, but the far greater part of those among whom he lived and conversed saw none of this beauty; for it was spiritually discerned. Observe, reader, carnal minds see no excellence in the Lord Jesus; nothing that should induce them to desire an acquaintance with, or interest in him. Nay, he is not only not desired, but he is <i>despised and rejected \u2014<\/i>, As one unworthy of the company and conversation of all men; despised as a <i>mean<\/i>, man, rejected as a <i>bad<\/i>, man, a deceiver of the people, an impostor, a blasphemer, an associate of Satan. He was <i>the stone which the builders refused;<\/i>, they would not have him to reign over them. <i>A man of sorrows \u2014<\/i>, Whose whole life was filled with, and, in a manner, made up of, a succession of sorrows and sufferings; <i>and acquainted with grief <\/i>\u2014Who had constant experience of, and familiar converse with, grievous afflictions. <i>And we hid,<\/i>,&c.\u2014We scorned to look upon him; or we looked another way, and his sufferings were nothing to us; though <i>never sorrow was like unto his sorrows. <\/i> <\/p>",
