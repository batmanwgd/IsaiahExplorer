    "html": "<p> (2) Who raised up . . .\u2014More accurately, Who hath raised up from the East the man whom Righteousness calls (or, whom He calls in righteousness) to tread in His steps. (Comp. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NTY0XQ==\">Isaiah 45:2<\/a>.) The man so raised up to rule over the \u201cislands\u201d and the \u201cpeoples\u201d is none other than Koresh (Cyrus), the future restorer of Israel. The thought of Cyrus as working out the righteousness of God is dominant in these chapters ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDg3XQ==\">Isaiah 42:6<\/a>; <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NTc1XQ==\">Isaiah 45:13<\/a>). In the rapidity of his conquest, the prophet bids men see the proof that he is doing God\u2019s work. So Jeremiah speaks of Nebuchadnezzar as the servant of Jehovah ( <a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 27:6<\/a>). One may notice, if only to reject, the exposition of the Targum, followed by some commentators, which refers the verse to the call of Abraham and the victory of Genesis 14.<\/p> \n<p>He gave them.\u2014Better, He giveth them, the future seen as present. The LXX. and some modern critics follow a reading which gives, he maketh them as dust, their sword as stubble.<\/p> ",
