    "html": "<p> In this return of the exiles from every quarter of the globe to their fatherland, and for this mighty work of God on behalf of His church, which has been scattered in all directions, the whole creation is to praise Him. <em> \u201cSing, O heavens; and shout, O earth; and break out into singing, O mountains! for Jehovah hath comforted His people, and He hath compassion upon His afflicted ones.\u201d<\/em> The phrase \u05e8\u05e0\u05bc\u05d4 \u05e4\u05bc\u05e6\u05d7 , like \u05d5\u05e8\u05e0\u05bc\u05df \u05e4\u05bc\u05e6\u05d7 (which occurs in <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 98:4<\/a> as well as in Isaiah), is peculiarly Isaiah's (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3OTM2XQ==\">Isaiah 14:7<\/a>, and several times in chapters 40-66). \u201cThe afflicted ones\u201d (<em> \u201ba\u0306niyy\u0131\u0304m <\/em> ) is the usual Old Testament name for the <em> ecclesia militans <\/em> . The future alternates with the perfect: the act of consolation takes place once for all, but the compassion lasts for ever. Here again the glorious liberty of the children of God appears as the focus from which the whole world is glorified. The joy of the Israel of God becomes the joy of heaven and earth. With the summons to this joy the first half of the prophecy closes; for the word \u05ea\u05d0\u05de\u05e8 , which follows, shows clearly enough that the prophecy has merely reached a resting-point here, since this word is unsuitable for commencing a fresh prophecy.<\/p>",
