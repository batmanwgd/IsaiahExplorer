And before the verb in the second line a MS. adds <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05db\u05df <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">ken<\/span>, so; which the Septuagint, Syriac, and Chaldee seem also to have had in their copies. In the third line of this verse the same MS. has in like manner <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d5\u05db\u05de\u05e9\u05d5\u05e9 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">vechimsos<\/span>, and two MSS. and the Babylonish Talmud <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05db\u05de\u05e9\u05d5\u05e9 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">kimsos<\/span>, adding the <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05db <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">caph<\/span> ; and in the fourth line, the Babylonish Talmud likewise adds <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05db\u05df <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">ken<\/span>, so, before the verb.<\/p>\n\n<p>Sir John Chardin, in his note on this place, tells us, \"that it is the custom in the east for youths, that were never married, always to marry virgins; and widowers, however young, to marry widows.\" - Harmer, Observ. 2 p. 482.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>So shall thy sons marry thee -<\/em>For <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d1\u05e0\u05d9\u05da <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">banayich<\/span>, thy sons, Bishop Lowth reads, restorer or builder, as he does not consider the word as the plural of <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d1\u05df <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">ben<\/span>, a son, but the participle <span class=\"translit\">benoni<\/span>  of the verb <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d1\u05e0\u05d4 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">banah<\/span>, he built.
