    "html": "<p><em>Therefore<\/em> &mdash;This verse indicates the punishment that would come upon them for their pride.<\/p><p><em>The Lord shall set up<\/em> &mdash;Hebrew, &lsquo;Shall exalt.&rsquo; That is, they shall overcome and subdue him.<\/p><p><em>The adversaries of Rezin<\/em> &mdash;King of Syria,<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3Nzg0XQ==\">Isaiah 7:1<\/a> . It should be observed here, that twenty-one manuscripts, instead of adversaries, read princes of Rezin. The sense seems to require this; as in the following verse, it is said that the Syrians will be excited against them.<\/p><p><em>Against him<\/em> &mdash;Against Ephraim.<\/p><p><em>And join his enemies together<\/em> &mdash;Hebrew, &lsquo;Mingle them together.&rsquo; They shall be excited into wild and agitated commotion, and shall pour down together on the land and devour it. In what way this would be done is specified in<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODQyXQ==\">Isaiah 9:12<\/a> .<\/p> ",
