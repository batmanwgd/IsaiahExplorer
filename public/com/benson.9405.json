All opinion that contradicts the clearest evidence of our reason, which plainly leads us to the acknowledgment of one only Supreme Being, infinitely good as well as powerful. With reference to this absurd opinion, held probably by the person to whom this prophecy is addressed, God, by his prophet, in the most significant terms, asserts his omnipotence and absolute supremacy. <i>I am<\/i> JEHOVAH, <i>and none else; forming light, and creating darkness; making peace, and creating evil; I<\/i> JEHOVAH<i>am the author of all these things.\u201d<\/i> Declaring that there is no power, either of light or darkness, of good or evil, of happiness or misery, independent of the one supreme God, infinite in power and in goodness.\u2014Bishop Lowth.<\/p> ",
