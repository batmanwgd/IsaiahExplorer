    "html": "<p> Thus does Jehovah avenge His church upon Edom. <em> \u201cFor Jehovah hath a day of vengeance, a year of recompense, to contend for Zion. And the brooks of Edom are turned into pitch, and its dust into brimstone, and its land becomes burning pitch. Day and night it is not quenched; the smoke of Edom goes up for ever: it lies waste from generation to generation; no one passes through it for ever and ever.\u201d<\/em> The one expression, \u201cto contend for Zion,\u201d is like a flash of lightning, throwing light upon the obscurity of prophecy, both backwards and forwards. A day and a year of judgment upon Edom (compare <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODQ2LDE4ODcxXQ==\">Isaiah 61:2; Isaiah 63:4<\/a>) would do justice to Zion against its accusers and persecutors (<em> r\u0131\u0304bh <\/em> , <em> vindicare <\/em> , as in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4Njk2XQ==\">Isaiah 51:22<\/a>). The everlasting punishment which would fall upon it is depicted in figures and colours, suggested by the proximity of Edom to the Dead Sea, and the volcanic character of this mountainous country. The unquenchable fire (for which compare <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4OTQ3XQ==\">Isaiah 66:24<\/a>), and the eternally ascending smoke (cf., <a class=\"ref\">Revelation 19:3<\/a>), prove that the end of all things is referred to. The prophet meant primarily, no doubt, that the punishment announced would fall upon the land of Edom, and within its geographical boundaries; but this particular punishment represented the punishment of all nations, and all men who were Edomitish in their feelings and conduct towards the congregation of Jehovah.<\/p>",
