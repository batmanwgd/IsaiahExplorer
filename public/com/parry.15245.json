When this prophecy is fulfilled, the Lord will not \"be removed into a corner\"; he will no longer need to withdraw himself from his people because they will no longer be idolatrous or rebellious. Rather, their<i> <\/i>eyes shall see their teacher when he comes in glory to Israel as a whole and to her people individually.<\/p> ",
