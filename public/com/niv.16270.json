But now we move beyond the initial astonishment to outright rejection. Isaiah makes it explicit that this Servant is \u201cthe arm of the L<small>ORD<\/small>\u201d that had been promised (53:1). But that report is clearly disbelieved. Why? Three reasons are given. (1) He comes onto the scene in a quiet and unassuming way (53:2). (2) He has no extraordinary beauty or attractiveness to draw people to him; his \u201cappearance\u201d was quite ordinary. (3) Finally, he is rejected because he takes on himself the pain and \u201csuffering\u201d of the world (53:3).<\/p>     <p>\u2003This suffering should not be restricted to physical suffering in the light of what else is said in the poem, but neither should it be construed to exclude such suffering, which is often as much the result of sin as murder or warfare is. But we find pain and suffering disturbing, both because we do not know what to say in sympathy and because it reminds us of our own vulnerability. So we try to ignore it (\u201chide [our] faces\u201d) and not to think about it (\u201cesteemed him not\u201d). The Servant has come to take away the sins of the world, but no one pays any attention to him.<\/p>     ",
