The rejoicing may have been the result of Ahaz's death, but more likely was directed to other oppressors. J. R. Dummelow suggested that the broken rod applied more directly to the Assyrian king, Tiglath-pileser (747-734 b.c.), who had been an ally of Ahaz. (TOVBC, 426.) However, Victor Ludlow stated that this premature rejoicing was \"either in the death of [Assyrian King] Shalmaneser V (727-722) or the freedom Philistia maintained after Sargon's conquest of Samaria and Israel (722-721).\" (IPSP, 190.) In any event, the rejoicing would be short-lived because further oppression was prophesied.<\/p>",
