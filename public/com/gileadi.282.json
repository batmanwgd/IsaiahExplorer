Entertainments cease and the indolent lifestyle of pleasure lovers becomes a thing of the past. The curse the prophet had pronounced as a warning to Jehovah&rsquo;s people turns into reality: &ldquo;Woe to those who go after liquor as soon as they arise in the morning, who linger at night parties, inflamed by wine! There are harps and lyres, drums, flutes, and wine at their banquets, but they regard not what Jehovah does, nor perceive his hands at work&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc3NTEiOjJ9XQ==\">Isaiah 5:11-12<\/a>).<\/p>",
