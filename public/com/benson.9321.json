Or, it shall, as it were, be sharpened and made ready in heaven, to bathe itself on earth.<i> It shall come down upon<\/i><i> Idumea<\/i> \u2014 Upon the Edomites, who, though they were nearly related to the Israelites, yet were their implacable enemies. But these are named for all the enemies of God\u2019s church, of whom they were an eminent type.<i> The people of my curse<\/i> \u2014 Whom I have devoted to utter destruction, as the word properly signifies.<i> The sword of the Lord is filled with blood \u2014<\/i> Shall drink its fill of blood. The metaphor is taken from a great glutton, who is almost insatiable,<i> With the blood of lambs,<\/i> &c. \u2014 By lambs, and goats, and rams, he means people of all ranks and conditions, high and low, rich and poor. Dr. Waterland renders the verse, \u201cWhen my sword in heaven is bathed, behold it shall sink deep into Idumea, into the people whom I have devoted to judgment.\u201d<i> For the Lord hath a sacrifice<\/i> \u2014 So the prophet terms this bloody work, because it was done by God\u2019s command, and for the honour of his justice and righteous government, and therefore was a service acceptable to him;<i> in Bozrah<\/i> \u2014 A chief city of Edom, (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODY4XQ==\">Isaiah 63:1<\/a> ,) and a type of those cities which should be most hostile to God\u2019s people.<\/p> ",
