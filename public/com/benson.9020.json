Vitringa is of opinion that this verse \u201crefers to the first disciples of Jesus Christ, who, seeing and deploring the destruction of the Jews, should rest safely under the protection of God; while, according to the next clause, the Gentiles should be brought into the communion of the church, and rejoice in those benefits, prerogatives, and privileges, whereof the carnal, rich, and luxurious Jews were deprived.\u201d See <a class=\"ref\">John 10:16<\/a>. <\/p> ",
