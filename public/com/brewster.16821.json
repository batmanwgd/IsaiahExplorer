(See <a class=\"ref\">Matthew 12:39<\/a>; <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzc1OCI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 5:18-19<\/a>.) Foremost, it was the Lord who offered to provide a sign. Additionally, there have been occasions when, for His purposes, the Lord has willingly provided such signs. (See <a class=\"ref\">Judges 6:36-40<\/a>.) In latter-day revelation the Savior said: \"Yea, signs come by faith, not by the will of men, nor as they please, but <i>by the will of God.<\/i>\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 63:10<\/a>; italics added.)<\/p>",
