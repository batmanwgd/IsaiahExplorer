Have their sins led God to abandon them, and to harden their hearts as He hardened Pharaoh\u2019s? (Comp. <a class=\"ref\">Romans 9:17-22<\/a>.) Are they given over as to a reprobate mind? Against that thought he finds refuge, where only men can find it, in prayer, and in pleading God\u2019s promise and the \u201celection of grace,\u201d to which He at least remains faithful, though men are faithless. Conscious that they have no power without Him to return to Him, they can ask Him to return to them. <\/p> ",
