They are assured that they will not be excluded from close fellowship with the church (\u201cin my house and within my walls\u201d), and also promised, as a superabundant compensation for the want of posterity, long life in the memory of future ages, by whom their long tried attachment to Jehovah and His people in circumstances of great temptation will not be forgotten. <br> <\/p> ",
