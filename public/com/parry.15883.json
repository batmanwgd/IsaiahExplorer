Moroni gave a valuable context to this prophecy when he quoted it to Joseph Smith on 22 September 1823. He said that the Church would prosper and grow despite persecution, \"increasing in knowledge till they shall be sanctified and receive an inheritance where the glory of God will rest upon them; and when this takes place, and all things are prepared, the ten tribes of Israel will be revealed in the north country, whither they have been for a long season; and when this is fulfilled will be brought to pass that saying of the prophet&hellip;[quotes 59:20].\" <\/p> <p>Not only will Christ come to Zion but he will then go forth from Zion. Paul wrote: \"Blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in. And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob: for this is my covenant unto them, when I shall take away their sins\" (<a class=\"ref\">Rom. 11:25-27<\/a>). Elder Orson Pratt declared, \"The Zion of the last days&hellip;is the Church and kingdom of God; and out of that Church or kingdom or Zion is to come a Deliverer, who will turn away ungodliness from Jacob after the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.\" <\/p> <p><i>them that turn from transgression in Jacob. <\/i>The Lord will \"come to\"<b> <\/b>the repentant among those who receive the Abrahamic covenant (66:5). This seems to refer to the Second Coming.<\/p> ",
