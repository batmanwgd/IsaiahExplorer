Following the combination mentioned above, we find that the allies now prepared for a second united expedition against Jerusalem. In the meantime, Jerusalem was in the condition described in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzY2MiI6M30=\">Isaiah 1:7-9<\/a>, viz., like a besieged city, in the midst of enemies plundering and burning on every side. Elath had fallen, as Rezin's timely return clearly showed; and in the prospect of his approaching junction with the allied army, it was quite natural, from a human point of view, that the court and people of Jerusalem should tremble like aspen leaves. \u05d5\u05d9\u05e0\u05e2 is a contracted <em> fut<\/em> . <em> kal<\/em> , ending with an <em> a<\/em> sound on account of the guttural, as in <a class=\"ref\">Ruth 4:1<\/a> (Ges. \u00a772, Anm. 4); and \u05e0\u05d5\u05e2 , which is generally the form of the <em> infin. abs<\/em> .
