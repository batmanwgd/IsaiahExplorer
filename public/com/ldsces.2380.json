    "html": " <p>The prophet Isaiah introduced the vision of the restoration of the gospel in the latter days by explaining that the truths and the keys of former days were to be restored. He also observed the restoration of new keys in the dispensation of the fulness of times (see <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDkwXQ==\">v. 9<\/a>). Using the metaphor of childbirth he described the restoration of the earthly kingdom following a long period of apostasy, during which the heavens had been sealed (see <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDk1XQ==\">v. 14<\/a>; compare <a class=\"ref\">Revelation 12:1&ndash;2, 13, 17<\/a>). The Church will be restored in the last days, before the destruction that will make the mountains as plains and dry up the waters, and before the return of the scattered tribes of Israel, when they will come on paths they have not known, and the light of the gospel will dispel the darkness they have so long endured (see <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODQ5NiI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 42:15&ndash;16<\/a>). Isaiah reiterated the Lord&rsquo;s promise that the restored gospel would not be taken again from the earth and that the Lord will not forsake His own. (see <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDk3XQ==\">v. 16<\/a>; compare <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc2ODgiOjJ9LHsiMTc4OTYiOjZ9LHsiMTgyMDgiOjJ9LHsiMTgyMTIiOjJ9LHsiMjE4MDMiOjJ9LHsiMjIzMzciOjV9XQ==\">Isaiah 2:2&ndash;3; 11:11&ndash;16; 29:14&ndash;15, 18&ndash;19; Daniel 2:44&ndash;45; Joel 2:25&ndash;29<\/a>.) <\/p> <p class=\"cite\"> LDS Church Educational System Old Testament Student Manual, 1 Kings&ndash;Malachi, Religion 302, Chapter 16, Item 19 <\/p> ",
