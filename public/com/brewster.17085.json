In His postmortal ministry, He visited the \"other sheep\" in the Americas as promised (<a class=\"ref\">John 10:16; 3 Nephi 15:21<\/a>) and still \"other sheep\" who were \"not of [that] land, neither of the land of Jerusalem\" (<a class=\"ref\">3 Nephi 16:1<\/a>). His visit in 1820 to the young Prophet Joseph Smith commenced in earnest the work of the gathering, which shall continue in intensity until His glorious second coming. (See BICQ, 107-14.)<\/p>",
