For the time is coming when this land shall be laid desolate; and, instead of vines and other fruits, it shall yield nothing but briers and thorns. <i>Yea, upon all the houses of joy <\/i>\u2014Upon that ground where now your houses stand, in which you take your fill of mirth and pleasure. <i>Because the palaces <\/i>\u2014Hebrew, <span class=\"hebrew_text\">,\u05d0\u05e8\u05de\u05d5\u05df <\/span>,, <i>the palace, <\/i>,the king\u2019s house, and other magnificent buildings in the city, <i>shall be forsaken <\/i>,\u2014 <\/p>,\n <p>Shall be destitute of inhabitants. <i>The multitude of the city shall be left <\/i>\u2014Shall be forsaken of God and given up into their enemies\u2019 hands. <i>The forts, <\/i>,&c <i>., shall be for dens for ever <\/i>\u2014For a long time; <i>a joy of wild asses <\/i>\u2014Desolate places, in which wild asses delight to be. \u201cThis description,\u201d says Bishop Lowth, \u201cof impending distresses belongs to other times than that of Sennacherib\u2019s invasion, from which they were so soon delivered. It must, at least, extend to the ruin of the country and city by the Chaldeans. And the promise of blessings which follows was not fulfilled under the Mosaic dispensation; they belong to the kingdom of Messiah.\u201d <\/p>,",
