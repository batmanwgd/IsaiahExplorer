    "html": " <i>made the world as a wilderness.<\/i> The Lord's creative effort made the world into a place that was called \"good\" (<a class=\"ref\">Gen. 1:10-31<\/a>), but Lucifer's work had an opposite effect, for he <i>made the world as a wilderness.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>destroyed the cities.<\/i> Lucifer is the destroyer; he destroys both cities and souls.<\/p> <p><i>opened not the house of his prisoners.<\/i> The New International Version reads that Lucifer \"would not let his captives go home,\" which is a possible reference to the fact that Lucifer does not want his spiritual captives, or those bound by sin, to be released. Lucifer's goal, of course, stands in direct opposition to Jesus Christ's righteous and perfect desire, which is to release from sin all those who come unto him.<\/p> ",
