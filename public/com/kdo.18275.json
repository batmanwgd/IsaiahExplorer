    "html": "<p> In the anticipation of such a future, those who inwardly participate in the present sufferings of Zion are to rejoice beforehand in the change of all their suffering into glory. <em> \u201cRejoice ye with Jerusalem, and exult over her, all ye that love her; be ye delightfully glad with her, all ye that mourn over her, that he may suck and be satisfied with the breast of her consolations, that ye may sip and delight yourselves in the abundance of her glory.\u201d<\/em> Those who love Jerusalem (the abode of the church, and the church itself), who mourn over her (<em> hith'abbe\u0304l <\/em> , inwardly mourn, <a class=\"ref\">1 Samuel 15:35<\/a>, prove and show themselves to be mourners and go into mourning, <em> b. Mo\u00ebd katan<\/em> 20<em> b<\/em> , the word generally used in prose, whereas \u05d0\u05d1\u05dc , to be thrown into mourning, to mourn, only occurs in the higher style; compare \u05e6\u05d9\u05bc\u05d5\u05df \u05d0\u05d1\u05dc\u05d9 , <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODc4NF0seyIxODg0NiI6Mn0sWzE4ODQyXV0=\">Isaiah 57:18; Isaiah 61:2-3; Isaiah 60:20<\/a>), these are even now to rejoice in spirit with Jerusalem and exult on her account (<em> ba\u0302h <\/em> ), and share her ecstatic delight with her (<em> 'itta\u0302h <\/em> ), in order that when that in which they now rejoice in spirit shall be fulfilled, they may suck and be satisfied, etc. Jerusalem is regarded as a mother, and the rich actual consolation, which she receives (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4Njc3XQ==\">Isaiah 51:3<\/a>), as the milk that enters her breasts (<em> sho\u0304d <\/em> as in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODM4XQ==\">Isaiah 60:16<\/a>), and from which she now supplies her children with plentiful nourishment. \u05d6\u05d9\u05d6 , which is parallel to \u05e9\u05c1\u05d3 (not \u05d6\u05d9\u05d5 , a reading which none of the ancients adopted), signifies a moving, shaking abundance, which oscillates to and fro like a great mass of water, from \u05d6\u05d0\u05d6\u05d0 , to move by fits and starts, for <em> pellere movere <\/em> is the radical meaning common in such combinations of letters as \u05d6\u05d0 , \u05d6\u05e2 , \u05e8\u05d0 , <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 42:5<\/a>, to which Bernstein and Knobel have correctly traced the word; whereas the meaning <em> emicans fluxus <\/em> (Schr\u00f6der), or <em> radians copia <\/em> (Kocher), to pour out in the form of rays, has nothing to sustain it in the usage of the language.<\/p>",
