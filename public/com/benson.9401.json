Xenophon tells us, that Cyrus used to compare kings in general, and himself in particular, to a shepherd. \u2014 <i>Cyrop\u00e6d., <\/i> lib. 8. <i>And shall perform all my pleasure <\/i>\u2014All that I command him to do, especially to give leave and order for the rebuilding of the city and temple of Jerusalem, as it here follows. This prophecy, which thus speaks of Cyrus by name, as foreknown and appointed by the divine counsel for the performance of the great work designed by providence, is one of the most remarkable contained in Scripture, of the same kind with that <a class=\"ref\">1 Kings 13:1-2 <\/a>. <\/p> ",
