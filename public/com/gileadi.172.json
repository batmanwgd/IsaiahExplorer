Like the Songs of Salvation Moses and the Israelites sang after their exodus out of Egypt (<a class=\"ref\">Exodus 15:1-21<\/a>), two Songs of Salvation&mdash;one individual (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzkwMiI6M30=\">vv 1-3<\/a>), the other collective (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzkwNSI6M30=\">vv 4-6<\/a>)&mdash;follow the exodus of Jehovah&rsquo;s people to Zion. At such times, spontaneous praise erupts from the hearts of those whom Jehovah saves. Though they may feel his <em>anger<\/em> for a season because of their transgressions&mdash;as he allows the king of Assyria\/Babylon to subject them&mdash;when they repent Jehovah turns his <em>anger<\/em> away.<\/p>",
