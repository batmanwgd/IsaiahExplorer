    "html": "<p> (9) In that day shall his strong cities be as a forsaken bough.\u2014Better, his fortified cities shall be like a forsaken tract of forest and hill-top. These were naturally the usual sites of fortresses (<a class=\"ref\">2 Chronicles 27:4<\/a>), and the gist of the prediction is that they shall be left uninhabited and in ruins. The LXX., it may be noticed, either followed a different reading or else give a curious paraphrase, \u201cthy cities shall be forsaken, like as the Amorites and Hivites forsook them before the face of the children of Israel.\u201d The whole verse reminds us of the \u201cgreat forsaking\u201d of<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzgyXQ==\">Isaiah 6:12<\/a> .<\/p> ",
