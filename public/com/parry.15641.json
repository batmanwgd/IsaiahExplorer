    "html": " <p>This chapter of Isaiah is the first one quoted in the Book of Mormon. Nephi gives his purpose in quoting it: \"I speak unto all the house of Israel&hellip;. that I might more fully persuade them to believe in the Lord their Redeemer I did read unto them that which was written by the prophet Isaiah\" (<a class=\"ref\">1 Ne. 19:19,  23<\/a>). <\/p> <p>In <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isa. 48<\/a> the Lord speaks to members of the Church, those who have come \"out of the waters of baptism\" (48:1). He is angry at those Church members who \"swear by the name of the Lord\" but \"swear not in truth, nor in righteousness\" (48:1). They are \"obstinate\" (48:4); they are prone to give credit to their \"idol\" or \"graven image\" for the works that God has done (48:5); and they are transgressors \"from the womb\" (48:8). But because of his goodness (\"for my name's sake\"; 48:9), the Lord will \"defer\" his anger, and not \"cut thee&hellip;off\" (48:9). Israel has been \"refined\" and \"chosen&hellip;in the furnace of affliction\" (48:10). The Lord will punish her enemies (48:14), and he will continue to send prophets to teach and bless those who will listen (\"I have called him to declare\"; 48:15). Of this passage and its greater context, commentary in the Jerusalem Bible says:<\/p> <p> \"The hardening of Israel is a familiar theme of the prophets and the historical books. Israel has 'stiffened his neck' (<a class=\"ref\">Ex. 32:9; Deut. 9:13<\/a>[-24 <a class=\"ref\">2 Kgs. 17:14; Jer. 7:26<\/a>[-28 has made himself blind and deaf (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzc3OSI6Mn0=\">Isa. 6:9-10<\/a>&hellip;; 2:19-20; 43:8) by refusing to serve God, by breaking the yoke of his Law (<a class=\"ref\">Jer. 2:20; 5:5<\/a>) his punishment is to bend his neck to the yoke of a foreign nation (<a class=\"ref\">Deut. 28:48<\/a>; see <a class=\"ref\">Jer. 27:8,  11<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\"> 28; 30:8<\/a>; <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODMzXQ==\">Isa. 9:3<\/a>; <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODc4XQ==\"> 10:27<\/a>). But Yahweh, true to himself, has not rejected his people (vv. 9-11), and the light of his salvation will pierce the eyes of the blind who had rebelled (42:7, 16, 18; 43:8&hellip;).\" <\/p> <blockquote> [<i>Hearken<\/i> and]     <br><i>hear<\/i>&hellip;this,     <br>O <i>house of Jacob,<\/i>     <br>[who] are called by the name of <i>Israel,<\/i>     <br>and are <i>come forth out<\/i> of the <u>waters of Judah<\/u>,     <br>[or <i>out<\/i> of the <u>waters of baptism<\/u>,]     <br>[who] <i>swear<\/i> by the name of the <u>Lord<\/u>,     <br>and <i>make mention<\/i> of the <u>God of Israel<\/u>,     <br>[yet they swear] <i>not in truth,<\/i>     <br><i>nor in righteousness.
