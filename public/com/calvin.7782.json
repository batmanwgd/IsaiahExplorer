    "html": " <p> <i>Attend to me, my people. <\/i> There are good reasons why the Lord so frequently demands that he shall be heard. We know by experience how slow we are to hear him, especially in adversity; and even when we would have great need of consolation, we reject it by our impatience, and faint. Each of us, therefore, the sorer are the afflictions which press upon him, ought to endeavor more earnestly to enlarge his heart, and in this way to arouse himself, and to shake off his slothfulness, that he may receive consolation. What is here demanded is <i>attention, <\/i> to sustain our hearts by patience, till the season of grace be fully come. <\/p> \n <p> <i>For the law shall go forth from me. <\/i> The meaning is, that the Lord will again reign, and will arouse his Church to call on his name. Though the word <i>Law <\/i> is equivalent to the edict which God shall order to be proclaimed, when he shall be pleased to gather his Church, yet at the same time he describes his manner of reigning; namely, by his \u201cLaw\u201d and byhis doctrine. Hence we see that wherever doctrine is rejected, God\u2019s government is not found, that is, is not recognised by men. By <i>judgment <\/i> he means the order and administration of government, by which he shall restore his kingdom. <\/p> \n <p> <i>For a light of the peoples, <\/i> He says that this will be \u201cfor a light of the peoples,\u201d because, when God begins to reign, miserable men are rescued from darkness and enlightened by the doctrine of the word. <\/p> \n <p> <i>I will reveal. <\/i> This vero <span class=\"greek-hebrew\"> \u05d0\u05e8\u05d2\u05d9\u05e2 <\/span> <i>(argiang) <\/i> is variously expounded by commentators, because <span class=\"greek-hebrew\"> \u05e8\u05d2\u05e2 <\/span> (<i>ragang <\/i>) has various significations. Sometimes it signifies to \u201ccut\u201d and \u201copen,\u201d and sometimes \u201cto be at rest.\u201d Some therefore explain it, \u201cI will cause to rest,\u201d that is, \u201cI will establish;\u201d and that meaning is not inappropriate. Most of the Jewish writers explain it differently, but I shall not relate their crooked and harsh interpretations. I rather approve of this translation, \u201cI will manifest judgment,\u201d or, \u201cI will cause judgment to break forth,\u201d or, which means the same thing, \u201cI will reveal;\u201d because I think that it agrees better with the former clause. Repetitions, we know, are very customary among the Hebrew writers. Although, therefore, he employs different words, still the meaning is the same. Having formerly said that \u201cthe law shall go forth from him,\u201d he now says that \u201che will reveal judgment.\u201d <\/p> ",
