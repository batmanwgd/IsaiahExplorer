Although Jehovah&rsquo;s judgments may appear to last forever, causing many of his people to grow weary (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NTI4LDE4NjUxXQ==\">Isaiah 43:22; 49:14 <\/a>), all is worth the outcome (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTI4LDE4ODkwXQ==\">Isaiah 25:9; 64:4 <\/a>). Jehovah keeps his part of the terms of his covenant by showing favor or compassion toward those who endure to the end (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MjM2LDE4NjUwXQ==\">Isaiah 30:18; 49:13 <\/a>). He becomes their <em>arm <\/em> of <em>salvation <\/em> when he intervenes wondrously to deliver them (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4Njc5LDE4ODcyXQ==\">Isaiah 51:5; 63:5 <\/a>). <\/p> ",
