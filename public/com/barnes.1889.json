But if we go indulging still in sin; if we are false and hollow and hypocritical in our worship; or if, while we keep up the regular forms of devotion, we are nevertheless guilty of oppression, cruelty, and dishonesty, we have no right to expect that he will hear us (see the notes at <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 1:15<\/a> ).<\/p><p><em>If thou take away... the yoke<\/em>&mdash;(See the notes at <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 58:6<\/a>).<\/p><p><em>The putting forth of the finger<\/em>&mdash;That is, if you cease to contemn and despise others; if you cease to point at them the finger of scorn.
