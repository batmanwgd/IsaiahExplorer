The fruits of hatching the works of Satan and weaving \"spiders' webs\" (59:6) are emptiness and futility, not peace and well-being.<\/p> <p><i>no judgment in their goings.<\/i> There is no equity or justice in their way of life. The wicked do not follow the path of justice toward God (<a class=\"ref\">Prov. 10:9<\/a>) or to hear their fellowmen, nor do they feel that God has dealt justly with them (<a class=\"ref\">Job 27:8-10<\/a>). <\/p> <p><i>crooked paths.<\/i> A twisted, perverted, unrighteous way of life is contrasted with the strait and narrow path. These are the same paths as in 59:7, which lead to waste and destruction.<\/p> ",
