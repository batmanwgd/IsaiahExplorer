    "html": " <i>day of the Lord.<\/i> This phrase often refers to the events connected with Jesus' second coming (<a class=\"ref\">2 Ne. 12:12-13; 23:6<\/a>, <a class=\"ref\"> 9<\/a>). The day of the Lord is mentioned five times in this section to emphasize its importance. Throughout Isaiah, the phrases <i>day of the Lord, in that day, day of visitation, day of his fierce anger,<\/i> and <i>day of the Lord's vengeance<\/i> are found more than fifty-five times, underscoring how frequently Isaiah's writings emphasize the last days and the Second Coming. According to modern-day revelation, our era is called \"today\" until Christ comes: \"Behold, now it is called today until the coming of the Son of Man&hellip;. For after today cometh the burning&hellip;tomorrow all the proud and they that do wickedly shall be as stubble\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 64:23-<\/a> 24).<\/p> <p><i>Lord of hosts.<\/i> See commentary on 1:9.<\/p> <p><i>soon cometh. <\/i>This phrase parallels the expression \"I come quickly,\" found several times in the Doctrine and Covenants (see, for example, <a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 33:18; 34:12<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\"> 49:28<\/a>). The expressions warn us to be prepared always for the coming of the Lord.<\/p> <p><i>upon all nations.<\/i> The Lord's judgment will be universal.<\/p> ",
