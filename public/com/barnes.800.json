We may remark here, how vain were the refuges to which they would resort&mdash;as if they were safe from &ldquo;God,&rdquo; when they had fled to the places in which they sought safety from &ldquo;man.&rdquo; The image here is, however, one that is very sublime. The earth shaking; the consternation and alarm of the people; their renouncing confidence in all to which they had trusted; their rapid flight; and their appearing on the high projecting cliffs, are all sublime and terrible images. They denote the severity of God&rsquo;s justice, and the image is a faint representation of the consternation of people when Christ shall come to judge the earth;<a class=\"ref\">Revelation 6:15-17<\/a> .<\/p> ",
