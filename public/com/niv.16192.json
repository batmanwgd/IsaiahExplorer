    "html": "               <p>T<small>HIS SECTION IS<\/small> composed of two parts: The first (30:1\u20135) states the foolishness of trusting Egypt; the second (30:6\u20137) illustrates this message. Verse 1 is reminiscent of 1:2 as it speaks of \u201cobstinate [or rebellious] children.\u201d God has carefully reared them, but they refuse to follow his ways (see Ezek. 16). They do not consult their Father for his counsel and advice but hastily make their own \u201cplans\u201d (Isa. 30:1) to serve what they think are their own best interests. Because they are \u201cwayward in spirit\u201d (29:24), they refuse to be led by God\u2019s Spirit (cf. 63:10\u201311). As a result, they do the very thing they are forbidden to do: go back to Egypt (cf. Deut. 17:16).<\/p>     <p>\u2003Admittedly, allying themselves with Egypt makes a good deal of sense from a human point of view. No other nation offers any hope of \u201cprotection\u201d to Judah. On the surface, Egypt is large enough and powerful enough to be like a large palm tree, whose fronds offer \u201cshade\u201d (30:2) from Assyria\u2019s blazing sun. But God sees things differently. He sees that there is nothing behind the beautiful facade. There may be impressive \u201cofficials in Zoan\u201d (30:4), the town in the northeastern Nile Delta where the Hebrews were once enslaved (Ps. 78:12, 43), and there may be persuasive \u201cenvoys\u201d in \u201cHanes\u201d (perhaps Heracleopolis, north of Memphis), but there is nothing substantial behind the facade. The great palm tree is rotten in the center. Egypt cannot give any true help. Everyone who puts their trust in Egypt will be disgraced (\u201cput to shame,\u201d 30:5).<\/p>     <p>\u2003This idea of Egypt\u2019s helplessness is illustrated in a two-verse (30:6\u20137) \u201coracle\u201d or \u201cburden\u201d (Heb. ma\u015b\u015ba\u2019,). Isaiah pictures a caravan struggling through a terrible desert, filled with hardships and dangers. This sounds like the Sinai Desert. Perhaps the Assyrian presence on the Philistine plain has already made the direct approach down the coast to Egypt too risky. This caravan is carrying \u201criches\u201d and \u201ctreasures\u201d to Egypt. The mention of \u201cenvoys\u201d suggests that this is a diplomatic mission and that the caravan is carrying a large payment for the Egyptian \u201chelp.\u201d<\/p>     <p>\u2003But in fact, says Isaiah, all the struggle and hardship as well as the great expense are in vain. Egypt really can offer no help; they are \u201cunprofitable.\u201d In a final touch of sarcasm, Isaiah creates an oxymoron to describe Egypt. She is \u201cRahab the Do-Nothing.\u201d Rahab is another name for the chaos monster (see comments on \u201cLeviathan,\u201d 27:1), that terrifying dragon who is always threatening to destroy the order on which human life depends. But <em>this<\/em> Rahab is far from terrifying. In fact, all she does is sit in one place, not threatening anyone. She is a toothless old monster, too lazy to move.<\/p>     ",
