(23:15)     <br>Take an harp, go about the city,     <br>thou harlot that hast been forgotten;     <br>make sweet melody, sing many songs,     <br>that thou mayest be remembered. (23:16)     <br>And it shall come to pass after the end of seventy years, that the Lord will visit Tyre, and     <br>she shall turn to her hire, and shall commit fornication with all the kingdoms of the world upon the face of the earth. (23:17)     <br>And <i>her merchandise<\/i> and her hire shall be holiness <u>to the Lord<\/u>: it shall not be [hoarded] nor laid up; for <i>her merchandise<\/i> shall be for them that dwell <u>before the Lord<\/u>, to eat sufficiently, and for [choice] clothing.
