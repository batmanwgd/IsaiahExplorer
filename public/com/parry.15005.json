The administrative qualities of the government officials (princes), legislative\/ judicial leaders (counselors), and other public servants had degenerated to the point that their leadership was no more than foolishness (brutish), which brought Egypt to disaster.<\/p> <p><i>how say ye unto Pharaoh, I am the son of the wise\/the son of ancient kings. <\/i>\"The wisdom of Egypt, which was renowned among the ancients&hellip;, was the hereditary possession of the priestly caste, and from the same class were descended the kings. Pharaoh's counsellors could therefore boast that they were descended from wise men and from the ancient kings.\" Neither their heritage nor their boasting could prevent Egypt's wise men from becoming fools.<\/p> ",
