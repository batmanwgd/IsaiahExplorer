One who is justified is declared righteous (just) and pronounced innocent before God. This presupposes that the individual remains on the road of righteousness, doing all that is required for celestial salvation. (<a class=\"ref\">2 Nephi 31:19-20<\/a>.) We are incapable of becoming justified through our own efforts alone. We must rely on the grace of Christ. (<a class=\"ref\">2 Nephi 25:23; Alma 22:14<\/a>.)<\/p>",
