The prophets often compare warring nations to lions that mangle and destroy (<a class=\"ref\">Num. 23:24; 1 Chr. 12:8<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\">Micah 5:8; 3 Ne. 20:16<\/a>). <\/p> <p><i>his hand is stretched out still.<\/i> This phrase is repeated three times for emphasis (9:17, 21; 10:4). See commentary on 5:25.<\/p> <p><i>people turneth not unto him that smiteth them.<\/i> To <i>turn<\/i> is to repent. Even though God's judgments come upon Israel, her people still refuse to turn to the Lord who chastises them.<\/p> <p><i>neither do they seek the Lord.<\/i> In the words of a modern revelation, \"They <i>seek not the Lord<\/i> to establish his righteousness, but every man walketh in his own way, and after the image of his own god, whose image is in the likeness of the world\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 1:16<\/a>; emphasis added).<\/p> <p><i>Lord of hosts.<\/i> See commentary on 1:9.<\/p> ",
