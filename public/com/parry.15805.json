The Lord invites all to join with his people in proper observance of the Sabbath. Those who do so will be given great blessings, even the blessings of the temple.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>We too may seek and receive these blessings. Even though we may have already joined ourselves to the covenant of the Lord through baptism, we can grow in his blessings and his grace by observing the Sabbath with full purpose of heart.<\/i><\/p> ",
