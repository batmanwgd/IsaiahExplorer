(Comp. <a class=\"ref\">Zechariah 8:4<\/a>.) He who dies at the age of a hundred will be thought of as dying young; even the sinner, dying before his time as the penalty of his guilt, shall live out the measure of a century. The noticeable fact is that sin is thought of as not altogether extinct\u2014as still appearing, though under altered conditions, even in the restored Jerusalem.<\/p> ",
