    "html": "<p><em>Behold, for peace<\/em>&mdash;That is, instead of the health, happiness, and prosperity which I had enjoyed, and which I hope still to enjoy.<\/p><p><em>I had great bitterness<\/em>&mdash;Hebrew, &lsquo;Bitterness to me, bitterness;&rsquo; an emphatic expression, denoting intense sorrow.<\/p><p><em>But thou hast in love to my soul<\/em>&mdash;Margin, &lsquo;Loved my soul from the pit.&rsquo; The word which occurs here (\u05d7\u05e9\u05c1\u05e7\u05ea cha\u0302shaqta\u0302) denotes properly to join or fasten together; then to be attached to anyone; to be united tenderly; to embrace. Here it means that God had loved him, and had thus delivered his soul from death.<\/p><p><em>Delivered it from the pit of corruption<\/em>&mdash;The word rendered &ldquo;corruption&rdquo; (\u05d1\u05dc\u05d9 bel\u0131\u0302y), denotes consumption, destruction, perdition. It may be applied to the grave, or to the deep and dark abode of departed spirits; and the phrase here is evidently synonymous with sheol or hades. The grave, or the place for the dead, is often represented as a pit&mdash;deep and dark&mdash;to which the living descend ( <a class=\"ref\">Job 17:16; Job 33:18, Job 33:24-25, Job 33:30; Psalm 28:1; Psalm 30:3; Psalm 55:23; Psalm 69:15; Psalm 88:4<\/a>; compare <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3OTQ0XQ==\">Isaiah 14:15<\/a> , note, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3OTQ4XQ==\">Isaiah 14:19<\/a> , note).<\/p><p><em>For thou hast cast all my sins behind thy back<\/em>&mdash;Thou hast forgiven them; hast ceased to punish me on account of them. This shows that Hezekiah, in accordance with the sentiment everywhere felt and expressed in the Bible, regarded his suffering as the fruit of sin.<\/p> ",
