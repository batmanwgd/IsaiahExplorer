    "html": "<p><em>The city of confusion<\/em>&mdash;That Jerusalem is here intended there can be no doubt. The name &lsquo;city of confusion.&rsquo; is probably given to it by anticipation of what it would be; that is, as it appeared in prophetic vision to Isaiah (see the note at <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NjU2XQ==\">Isaiah 1:1<\/a> ). He gave to it a name that would describe its state when these calamities should have come upon it. The word rendered &lsquo;confusion&rsquo; (\u05ea\u05d4\u05d5 to\u0302hu\u0302) does not denote disorder or anarchy, but is a word expressive of emptiness, vanity, destitution of form, waste. It occurs <a class=\"ref\">Genesis 1:2<\/a> : &lsquo;And the earth was without form.&rsquo; In <a class=\"ref\">Job 26:7<\/a> , it is rendered &lsquo;the empty place;&rsquo; in <a class=\"ref\">1 Samuel 12:21; Isaiah 45:18-19<\/a> , &lsquo;in vain;&rsquo; and usually &lsquo;emptiness,&rsquo; &lsquo;vanity&rsquo;, &lsquo;confusion&rsquo; (see <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTA2LDE4NDM4LDE4NDgxXQ==\">Isaiah 24:10; Isaiah 40:17; Isaiah 41:29<\/a> ). In <a class=\"ref\">Job 12:24; Psalm 107:40<\/a> , it denotes a wilderness. Here it means that the city would be desolate, empty, and depopulated.<\/p><p><em>Is broken down<\/em>&mdash;Its walls and dwellings are in ruins.<\/p><p><em>Every house is shut up<\/em>&mdash;That is, either because every man, fearful of danger, would fasten his doors so that enemies could not enter; or more probably, the entrance to every house would be so obstructed by ruins as to render it impossible to enter it.<\/p>",
