This is a notable example of how to rightly divide<em>\"the Word of truth\"<\/em> , when we observe that the Messiah, in quoting this prophecy concerning Himself in <a class=\"ref\">Luke 4:18, Luke 4:19<\/a> , \"closed the book\", and did not go on to quote further in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 61:20<\/a> , because the former part of the prophecy referred to the then present time, and not to the future Dispensation of judgment. The Heb, accent separates these two clauses, indicated by \"[But]\", above. Note that the vengeance is assigned to a \"day\", in contrast with \"year\".<\/p> \n\n<p><em>God. <\/em> Hebrew. <i>Elohim. <\/i> App-4.<\/p> \n\n<p><em>mourn. <\/em> See note on <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzM0XQ==\">Isaiah 3:26<\/a> , and compare <a class=\"ref\">Matthew 5:4<\/a>.<\/p> ",
