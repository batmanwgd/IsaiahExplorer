And although the literal sense in which the \u201cwrath\u201d is here said to last but for \u201ca moment\u201d be, that God in due time brought back the captives to their native country, yet we draw from it a general doctrine, that the afflictions of the Church are always momentary, when we raise our eyes to its eternal happiness. We ought to remember what Paul has taught us, (<a class=\"ref\">2 Corinthians 4:17 <\/a>) that all the afflictions of believers are light and easy to be endured, and are justly considered to be momentary, while they look at the \u201ceternal weight of glory;\u201d for if we do not attend to this comparison, every day will seem to us like a year. There would be no propriety in comparing the seventy years of the captivity of the Jews to \u201ca moment,\u201d if it were not contrasted with the uninterrupted progress of the grace of God. <\/p> ",
