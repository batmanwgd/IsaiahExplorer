One of the basic beliefs of Latter-day Saints is: \"We believe \u2026 that the earth will be renewed and receive its paradisiacal glory.\" (<a class=\"ref\">A of F 1:10<\/a>.) Before the fall of Adam and Eve, this earth was a terrestrial sphere in a Garden-of-Eden state of existence. This same condition will return and prevail throughout the thousand-year period of time known as the Millennium. This will include \"bringing the mass of the earth back to the conditionit was in before the continents and islands were separated, when the earth was 'divided.'\" (See BICQ, 216-18.)<\/p>",
