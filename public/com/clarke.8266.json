Dibon was the name of a tower where also was an idolatrous temple; thither they went to weep and pray before their idols, that they might interpose and save them from their calamities. So R. D. Kimchi. Me is gone to Bajith and to Dibon: but Bishop Lowth reads Beth Dibon; this is the name of one place; and the two words are to be joined together, without the <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d5 <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, vau<\/span>, intervening. So the Chaldee and Syriac. This reading is not supported by any MS. or Version: but some MSS., instead of <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05e2\u05e8 <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, ar<\/span>, have <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05e2\u05d9\u05e8 <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, ir<\/span>, a city, others have <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05e2\u05d3 <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, ad<\/span>, unto, and some editions have <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05e2\u05dc <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, al<\/span>, upon.
