The Vulgate and our translators, have rendered them very fairly, as they are written and pointed in the text: <i>Fabri enim sunt ex hominibus<\/i>,. \"And the workmen they are of men.\" Out of which the commentators have not been able to extract any thing worthy of the prophet. I have given another explanation of the place; agreeable enough to the context, if it can be deduced from the words themselves. I presume that <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d0\u05d3\u05dd <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, adam<\/span>, <i>rubuit<\/i>, may signify <i>erubuit<\/i>, to be red through shame, as well as from any other cause; though I cannot produce any example of it in that particular sense; and the word in the text I would point <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05de\u05d0\u05d3\u05dd <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, meoddam<\/span>,; or if any one should object to the irregularity of the number, I would read <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05de\u05d0\u05d3\u05de\u05d9\u05dd <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, meoddamim<\/span>,. But I rather think that the irregularity of the construction has been the cause of the obscurity, and has given occasion to the mistaken punctuation. The singular is sometimes put for the plural. See <a class=\"ref\">Psalm 68:31<\/a>; and the participle for the future tense, see <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDMyXQ==\">Isaiah 40:11<\/a>.\u2014L. <\/p>",
