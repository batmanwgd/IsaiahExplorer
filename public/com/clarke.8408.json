The vineyard wishes for a wall and a fence of thorns - human strength and protection, (as the Jews were too apt to apply to their powerful neighbors for assistance, and to trust to the shadow of Egypt): Jehovah replies, that this would not avail her, nor defend her against his wrath. He counsels her, therefore, to betake herself to his protection. On which she entreats him to make peace with her.<\/p> \n\n<p>From the above note it appears that the bishop reads,<span class=\"greek-hebrew\"> \u05d7\u05d5\u05de\u05d4<\/span><span class=\"translit\"> chomah<\/span> , wall, for<span class=\"greek-hebrew\"> \u05d7\u05de\u05d4<\/span><span class=\"translit\"> chemah<\/span> , anger or fury, in accordance with the Syriac and Septuagint. The letter<span class=\"greek-hebrew\"> \u05d5<\/span><span class=\"translit\"> vau<\/span> makes the only difference, which letter is frequently absent from many words where its place is supplied by the point.<span class=\"translit\"> cholem<\/span> : it might have been so here formerly; and in process of time both<span class=\"translit\"> vau<\/span> and<span class=\"translit\"> cholem<\/span> might have been lost. The Syriac supports the learned bishop's criticism, as the word<span class=\"translit\"> shora<\/span> is there used; which word in the plural is found,<a class=\"ref\">Hebrews 11:30<\/a> ; : \"By faith the walls of Jericho. \"The bishop thinks the Septuagint is on his side: to me, it seems neither for nor against the criticism. The words in the Vatican copy are<span class=\"greek-hebrew\"> \u03b5\u03b3\u03c9 \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2 \u03bf\u03c7\u03c5\u03c1\u03b1<\/span> , I am a fortified city; which the Arabic follows: but instead of<span class=\"greek-hebrew\"> \u03bf\u03c7\u03c5\u03c1\u03b1<\/span> , the Codex Alexandrinus has<span class=\"greek-hebrew\"> \u03b9\u03c3\u03c7\u03c5\u03c1\u03b1<\/span> , I am a Strong city.<\/p> \n\n<p>The word<span class=\"greek-hebrew\"> \u05d7\u05d5\u05de\u05d4<\/span><span class=\"translit\"> chomah<\/span> , wall, is not found in any MS. in the collections of Kennicott and De Rossi, nor in any of my own MSS.<\/p> \n\n<p>However, one of Dr. Kennicott's MSS. has<span class=\"greek-hebrew\"> \u05d7\u05d9\u05de\u05d4<\/span><span class=\"translit\"> cheimah<\/span> ; but probably that which now appears to be a<span class=\"greek-hebrew\"> \u05d9<\/span><span class=\"translit\"> yod<\/span> was formerly a<span class=\"greek-hebrew\"> \u05d5<\/span><span class=\"translit\"> vau<\/span> , and now partially obliterated.<\/p> \n\n<p>This song receives much light from being collated with that in chap. 5.; and perhaps the bishop's criticism will find its best support from such a collation. In<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzQ1XQ==\">Isaiah 5:5<\/a> ; of that chapter, God threatens to take away the wall of his vineyard: this was done; and here the vineyard complains, I have no wall, and wishes for any kind of defense rather than be thus naked. This is the only natural support of the above criticism.<\/p> \n\n<p>\"About Tripoli there are abundance of vineyards and gardens, inclosed, for the most part, with hedges, which chiefly consist of the rhamnus, paliurus, oxyacantha, \"etc. Rawolf, p. 21, 22. A fence of thorns is esteemed equal to a wall for strength, being commonly represented as impenetrable.
