Guided by <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDUzXQ==\">Isaiah 41:1<\/a>; <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzY1OSI6Nn0=\">Isaiah 1:4-9<\/a>, we recognise here, as there, the utterance of the ideal Servant of Jehovah. That view, it needs scarcely be said, is the one suggested to all Christian minds by our Lord\u2019s application of the passage to His own work in <a class=\"ref\">Luke 4:16-22<\/a>. The opening words repeat what had been said by Jehovah of the Servant in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDgyXQ==\">Isaiah 42:1<\/a>. The \u201canointing,\u201d as it stands, might be that of king (<a class=\"ref\">1 Samuel 9:16; 1 Samuel 10:1<\/a>), or priest (<a class=\"ref\">Exodus 29:2; Leviticus 7:36<\/a>), or prophet (<a class=\"ref\">1 Kings 19:16<\/a>). As interpreted by its fulfilment, it may be held to include all three. <\/p>\n <p>To preach good tidings . . .\u2014Comp. Note on <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDMwXQ==\">Isaiah 40:9<\/a>. To this passage, more than any other, even than <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDMwXQ==\">Isaiah 40:9<\/a>, we may trace the use of the word \u201cgospel\u201d (\u201cevangel,\u201d \u201cgood tidings\u201d) in our Lord\u2019s teaching and that of the Apostles. Claiming the promise as fulfilled in Himself, He became the great evangelist, and all who followed Him were called to the same office. <\/p>\n <p>To bind up the broken-hearted . . .\u2014The primary thought is that of a healing bandage applied to the heart\u2019s wounds. (Comp.), The Servant of Jehovah is the great physician as well as the evangelist. <\/p>\n <p>To proclaim liberty.\u2014Phrase and thought are taken from the law of the Year of Jubilee (<a class=\"ref\">Leviticus 25:10; Ezekiel 46:17; Jeremiah 34:8<\/a>). <\/p>\n <p>The opening of the prison.\u2014The LXX., adopted in <a class=\"ref\">Luke 4:18<\/a>, gives \u201crecovery of sight to the blind;\u201d and as the verb is never used for the opening of a room or door, and is used in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MzI2XQ==\">Isaiah 35:5<\/a>; <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDg4XQ==\">Isaiah 42:7<\/a>, for the opening of the eyes, that is probably its meaning here. <\/p>",
