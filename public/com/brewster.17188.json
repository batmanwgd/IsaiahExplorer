(JST Genesis 17:8-20.) Accordingly, those who were uncircumcised were said to be \"unclean,\" or \"without the sign of the covenant.\" Isaiah used this imagery to indicate that only the <i>covenant people<\/i> will be allowed to partake of the blessings of Zion. It should be noted that since the days of the mortal ministry of Him who made the covenant with Abraham even Jehovah or Jesus Christ circumcision has not been required. (See <a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 74<\/a>; DCE, 315-16.)<\/p>",
