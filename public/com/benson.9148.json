In other words, at that time, when God shall execute these severe judgments upon the Ephraimites, some, being fully convinced by experience that they had been deceived by their false prophets, and that their worship of idols had turned out as the true prophets foretold, shall turn themselves, by sincere repentance, to the God of their fathers, and, renouncing the errors of former times, and all their sins, shall worship and serve him in true faith and obedience.<\/p>",
