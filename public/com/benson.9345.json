But his glory was much more eminently revealed when Christ, <i>the Lord of glory, <\/i>was manifested in the flesh, and gave much clearer and fuller discoveries of God\u2019s glorious wisdom, holiness, goodness, and other divine perfections, than ever before had been imparted to mankind, or to his church. <i>And all flesh shall see it together <\/i>\u2014 All nations, Jews as well as Gentiles. <i>For the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it <\/i>\u2014 Though it may seem incredible, yet God is able to accomplish it.<\/p>",
