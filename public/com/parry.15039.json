    "html": " <p>The prophecy is a dialogue between Isaiah and an unnamed man of Seir. It goes as follows:<\/p> <blockquote><i>Man of Seir:<\/i> \"Watchman, how much of the night remains? Watchman, how much of the night remains?\"<\/blockquote> <blockquote> <i>Isaiah, the watchman:<\/i> \"The morning is coming, but then the night will come again. If you wish to inquire again, return to your home and come again to me later.\"<\/blockquote> <p>In the greater context of Isaiah's prophecies of judgment against the nations, the prophecy appears to be about a man who, weary from living in the apostate world (Seir = Edom = world), asks Isaiah, \"Watchman, how much of the night [sin, darkness, apostasy] remains? Watchman, how much of the night remains?\" Isaiah responds with, \"The morning [truth, light, the gospel] is coming, but the night [sin, darkness, apostasy] will return once more. If you wish to inquire again, return to your home and come again to me.\" Those who read Isaiah must remember that the prophecy is concerned with Dumah, although there may be a number of appropriate applications.<\/p> <blockquote>The burden of Dumah. He calleth to me out of Seir,     <br><i>Watchman,<\/i> <u>what of the night<\/u><i>?<\/i>     <br><i>Watchman,<\/i> <u>what of the night<\/u><i>?<\/i> (21:11)     <br>The watchman said,     <br>The <i>morning<\/i> cometh,     <br>and also the <i>night:<\/i>     <br>if <i>ye<\/i> will <i>inquire,<\/i>     <br><i>inquire<\/i> <i>ye:<\/i>     <br>return,     <br>come. (21:12)<\/blockquote> ",
