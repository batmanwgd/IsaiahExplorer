    "html": "<p> And His regal conduct is regulated by this His thoroughly spiritual nature.<em> \u201dAnd fear of Jehovah is fragrance to Him; and He judges not according to outward sight, neither does He pass sentence according to outward hearing.\u201d<\/em> We must not render it: His smelling is the smelling of the fear of God, i.e., the penetration of it with a keen judicial insight (as Hengstenberg and Umbreit understand it); for <em> he\u0304r\u0131\u0304ach <\/em> with the preposition <em> Beth<\/em> has not merely the signification to smell (as when followed by an accusative, <a class=\"ref\">Job 39:25<\/a>), but to smell with satisfaction (like \u05d1\u05bc \u05e8\u05d0\u05d4 , to see with satisfaction), <a class=\"ref\">Exodus 30:38; Leviticus 26:31; Amos 5:21<\/a>. The fear of God is that which He smells with satisfaction; it is <em> re\u0304ach n\u0131\u0304choach <\/em> to Him. Meier's objection, that fear of God is not a thing that can be smelt, and therefore that <em> he\u0304r\u0131\u0304ach <\/em> must signify to breathe, is a trivial one. Just as the outward man has five senses for the material world, the inner man has also a sensorium for the spiritual world, which discerns different things in different ways. Thus the second David scents the fear of God, and only the fear of God, as a pleasant fragrance; for the fear of God is a sacrifice of adoration continually ascending to God. His favour or displeasure does not depend upon brilliant or repulsive external qualities; He does not judge according to outward appearances, but according to the relation of the heart to His God.<\/p>",
