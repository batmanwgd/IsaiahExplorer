The waves crash and roar with frightening power, and it seems as though they are the ultimate reality with which we must come to terms. But in fact, that is not the case. As Psalm 2 says, it is the One who sits in the heavens who is the ultimate reality. Before his breath, the nations are no more substantial than bits of \u201cchaff\u201d or a rolling \u201ctumbleweed\u201d (Isa. 17:13; see also 11:4). They have their day, but suddenly night falls, and in the morning nothing is left of what seemed so enduring (17:14).<\/p>     <p>\u2003In other words, Isaiah is attempting to get his people to focus beyond apparent realities and onto the One who is reality in himself. The nations may plan to \u201cplunder\u201d and \u201cloot\u201d God\u2019s people, but whatever they may think, they do not control their own destinies (cf. 14:24\u201327).<\/p>     ",
