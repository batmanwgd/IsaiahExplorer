    "html": "<p>A negative response to Jehovah&rsquo;s warning leads to his people&rsquo;s destruction in his Day of Judgment. Their refusal to repent results in Jehovah&rsquo;s empowering their enemies against them. Like the term <em>fire<\/em> (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NjYyXQ==\">v 7<\/a>), the term <em>sword<\/em> has a dual meaning. In its present context, it identifies the king of Assyria\/Babylon, who personifies Jehovah&rsquo;s <em>fire<\/em> and <em>sword<\/em>. As Jehovah&rsquo;s instrument for destroying the wicked, he cleanses the earth before Jehovah comes to reign: &ldquo;With <em>fire<\/em> and with his <em>sword<\/em> will Jehovah execute judgment on all flesh, and those slain by Jehovah shall be many&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4OTM5XQ==\">Isaiah 66:16<\/a>; emphasis added).<\/p><p><em>By his <strong>mouth<\/strong> Jehovah has spoken it.<\/em> Israel&rsquo;s God makes his warning an official declaration&mdash;what their divine Judge decrees will indeed come to pass. As chapter 1 shows, however, Jehovah&rsquo;s people as a whole don&rsquo;t heed his warning. Many are beyond responding positively to a call to repent. Because Jehovah&rsquo;s servant who prepares the way before Jehovah&rsquo;s coming to reign on the earth serves as his <em>mouth<\/em> or mouthpiece, it is he who delivers Jehovah&rsquo;s final warning. Still, most ignore their peril and few survive the archtyrant&rsquo;s destruction of the world (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc4NTYiOjN9LHsiMTg1MDUiOjJ9LHsiMTg2MzMiOjJ9LFsxODkxMF1d\">Isaiah 10:5-7; 42:24-25; 48:18-19; 65:12<\/a>).<\/p>",
