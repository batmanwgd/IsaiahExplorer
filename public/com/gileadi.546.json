Her narcissism extends to her displacing God in the world just as her exemplar the king of Assyria\/Babylon does (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 14:13-14<\/a>). By thinking &ldquo;I exist, and other than me there is nothing,&rdquo; she blatantly seeks to appropriate Jehovah&rsquo;s divinity (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg1MTYiOjJ9LHsiMTg1NjciOjJ9LFsxODU4MCwxODU4NCwxODU5NiwxODU5Nl1d\">Isaiah 43:10-11; 45:5-6, 18, Isaiah 43:10-11; 45:5-6, 18, 22; 46:9; 46:9<\/a>). In the end, her anti-God attitude leads to a full measure of covenant curses coming upon her and her ilk &ldquo;in one day&rdquo;&mdash;Jehovah&rsquo;s Day of Judgment (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 2:12; 5:30; 7:17; 10:3; 13:6, 9; 34:8; 61:2; 63:4<\/a>).<\/p>",
