The word <i>return<\/i> (Hebrew <i>shub<\/i>) has two connected meanings: \"to return\" and \"to repent.\" The remnant of Israel who survive the destructions shall return \"unto the mighty God\" (10:21) through repentance and shall go back to their land of promise. The Old Testament formula for an apostate people's return to God is found in <a class=\"ref\">2 Chr. 30:6-9<\/a>, which speaks of their return to the promised land, to God through repentance, and to true temple worship.<\/p> ",
