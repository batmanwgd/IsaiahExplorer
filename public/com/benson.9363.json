The false gods are called upon to come forth and appear in person, and to give evident demonstration of their foreknowledge and power, by foretelling future events, and exerting their power in doing good or evil.\u201d <i>Let them <\/i>\u2014 Either the idols, or the idolaters in the name and by the help of their idols; <i>show us what shall happen <\/i>\u2014 All future events, which he divides into two sorts in the following clause, the former and the latter. <i>Let them show the former things <\/i>\u2014 Let the idols, or you their worshippers, prove that they ever uttered any true oracles or prophecies relating to former times, and, that the event hath exactly answered the prediction, and this will give credit to any predictions they shall deliver relating to things yet future. Or, by <i>the former things, <\/i>may be meant such things as should shortly come to pass, which might be better discerned than those things which were yet at a greater distance. So understood, he proposes the easiest part first. Let us try whether they can foretel those things which are even at the door, and, if so, we will try them further. Let them tell us what things shall happen, and in what order; which first and which last. <i>That we may consider them <\/i>\u2014 Hebrew,  <span class=\"hebrew_text\">\u05d5\u05e0\u05e9\u05c1\u05d9\u05de\u05d4 \u05dc\u05d1\u05e0\u05d5<\/span>, <i>and we will set our heart to it. <\/i>We will allow the argument its due weight, and either fairly answer it, or give up our cause against idols; <i>and know <\/i>\u2014 That we may know; <i>the latter end of them <\/i>\u2014 The consequence of them, as   <span class=\"hebrew_text\">\u05d0\u05d7\u05e8\u05d9\u05ea\u05df<\/span>may be rendered, whether the events answer to their predictions. <i>Or declare us things for to come <\/i>\u2014 Namely, after a long time. <i>That we<\/i> <i>may know that ye are gods <\/i>\u2014 That we may have, if not a certain proof, yet a probable argument of your deity. <i>Yea, do good or do evil <\/i>\u2014 Protect your worshippers, whom I intend to destroy, or destroy my people, whom I intend to save; <i>that we may be dismayed, <\/i>&c. \u2014 That I and my people may be astonished, and forced to acknowledge your godhead. <i>Behold, ye are of nothing <\/i>\u2014 You lately were nothing, without any being at all; <i>and your work of naught <\/i>\u2014 Your operations are like your beings; there is no reality in your beings, nor efficacy in your actions. <i>An abomination is he that chooseth you <\/i>\u2014 He that chooseth you for his gods is most abominable for his folly, as well as his wickedness.<\/p>",
