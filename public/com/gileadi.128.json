    "html": "<p>As biblical history shows, even when his people in general apostatize and Jehovah hides his face or presence from them, certain &ldquo;disciples&rdquo; remain loyal, as did the disciples or &ldquo;sons of the prophets&rdquo; anciently (<a class=\"ref\">2 Kings 2:3-7; 4:38; 6:1<\/a>). At such times, Jehovah withdraws the testimony of his truth and the law of his covenant from among his people and preserves them among those willing to live by them. The singular pronouns &ldquo;<em>I<\/em> will wait&rdquo; and &ldquo;<em>I<\/em> will expect&rdquo; highlight the idea that only loyal individuals endure through his people&rsquo;s dark phase and thus experience his deliverance (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTI4LDE4MjM2LDE4MjgyXQ==\">Isaiah 25:9; 30:18; 33:2<\/a>).<\/p> ",
