    "html": "<p align=\"center\" class=\"subtitle\"> XXXVIII.<\/p> \n<p>(1) In those days.\u2014On any supposition, the narrative of Hezekiah\u2019s illness throws us back to a time fifteen years before his death, and therefore to an earlier date than the destruction of the Assyrian army, which it here follows. So in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4Mzk3XQ==\">Isaiah 38:6<\/a> , the deliverance of the city is spoken of as still future. Assuming the rectified chronology given above, we are carried to a time ten or eleven years before the invasion, which was probably in part caused by the ambitious schemes indicated in Isaiah 39. It follows from either view that we have no ground for assuming, as some commentators have done, (1) that the illness was an attack of the plague that destroyed the Assyrian army, or (2) that the treasures which Hezekiah showed to the Babylonian ambassadors were in part the spoil of that army.<\/p> \n<p>Set thine house in order.\u2014Literally, Give orders to thy house, euphemistic for \u201cmake thy will.\u201d The words are a striking illustration, like Jonah\u2019s announcement that Nineveh should be destroyed in three days ( <a class=\"ref\">Jonah 3:4<\/a>), of the conditional character of prophecy. It would seem as if Isaiah had been consulted half as prophet and half as physician as to the nature of the disease. It seemed to him fatal; it was necessary to prepare for death. The words may possibly imply a certain sense of disappointment at the result of Hezekiah\u2019s reign. In the midst of the king\u2019s magnificence and prosperity there was that in the inner house of the soul, as well as in that of the outer life, which required ordering.<\/p> ",
