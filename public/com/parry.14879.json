The Hebrew root (<i>masa'<\/i>) literally means \"lifting\" or \"a lifting up,\" perhaps indicating that the prophecy or judgment is lifted up by the voice of the prophet against the people. Isaiah's prophetic calling included uttering a prophecy of doom against many peoples or nations, including Moab (15:1), Damascus (17:1), Egypt (19:1), the desert of the sea (21:1), Dumah (21:11), Arabia (21:13), the valley of vision (22:1), Tyre (23:1), and the beasts of the south (30:6). Similarly, the <i>burden<\/i> of the word of the Lord also came to Nahum (1:1), Habakkuk (1:1), Zechariah (12:1), and Malachi (1:1).<\/p> <p>The same Hebrew root is also used in connection with the lifting of the ensign (5:26; 11:12; 13:2) upon a high mountain. Hence, the Lord will \"lift up\" judgment against the wicked and will \"lift up\" an ensign to the righteous.<\/p> <p><i>Babylon.<\/i> A symbol of the world and wickedness: \"Go ye out from among the nations, even from Babylon, from the midst of wickedness, which is spiritual Babylon\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 133:14<\/a>). <\/p> <p> <i> Isaiah&hellip;did see.<\/i> The revelations came to Isaiah as visions wherein he saw the future (1:1).<\/p> ",
