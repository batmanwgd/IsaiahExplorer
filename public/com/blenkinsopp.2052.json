    "html": "<p>This prediction of an imminent Assyrian <em>Blitzkrieg<\/em> is well situated after the description of the earthquake as the first of two phases of punishment; the same sequence occurs in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODQ4LDE3ODU1XQ==\">9:18&ndash;10:4<\/a> and in the vision reports of Amos (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxNzgzMV0seyIxNzczNSI6Nn1d\">9:1&ndash;4<\/a>). It also serves as the immediate preface to the core narrative, a circumstance that helps to explain the similar editorial additions with which it and the core narrative conclude (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzcwXQ==\">5:30b<\/a> cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODMwXQ==\">8:22<\/a>). As such, it aligns with <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxNzgwMV0seyIxNzY1NiI6MzF9LFsxNzgxM10seyIxNzgwOSI6MjJ9XQ==\">7:18&ndash;19 and 8:5&ndash;8<\/a> in anticipating nothing but trouble from Ahaz&rsquo;s having recourse to Assyria for assistance. A more reflective and hopeful note will be sounded later in a poem about the Assyrians as an instrument in the hand of Yahveh (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxNzg1Nl0seyIxODAwNiI6MjV9XQ==\">10:5&ndash;19<\/a>). Later still, certainly in the post-disaster period, the antithesis between punishing events in the past and the expectation of a different future is highlighted by the raising of an ensign with a quite different purpose, to prepare for the return of dispersed Judeans to the homeland (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODk3XQ==\">11:12<\/a>). Comparison with the topographically specific account of the approach of a hostile army in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxNzg3OF0seyIxODI2MSI6MjB9XQ==\">10:27b&ndash;32<\/a> suggests that <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxNzc2Nl0seyIxODE5NSI6MjR9XQ==\">5:26&ndash;29<\/a> may have been written somewhat earlier. In keeping with his overall reading of <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxNzc0MV0seyIxNzkwMiI6Nn1d\">Isa 1&ndash;12<\/a>, Kaiser (1972, 110&ndash;13) attributes the passage to a &ldquo;theologian of history&rdquo; writing in the fifth century b.c.e. and refers the description of the approaching army to the Babylonians&rsquo; advancing on Jerusalem.<\/p><p>Commentators have been accustomed to finding mythological motifs in biblical descriptions of invading armies, generally approaching from the north (the so-called <em>V&ouml;lkerkampf<\/em> motif, cf. <a class=\"ref\">Jer 4:5&ndash;8, 13; Joel 2:4&ndash;9<\/a>), but in contrast to the agglutinated v <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzcwXQ==\">30<\/a>, the poem <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxNzc2Nl0seyIxODE5NSI6MjR9XQ==\">26&ndash;29<\/a> does not even indulge much in metaphor beyond the familiar image of the lion. True, the Assyrians are not named, but from the perspective of southern Palestine at that time Assyria, 350 miles or so distant, would seem like the ends of the earth. None of the elements of this description is unfamiliar. Like regimental colors, the &ldquo;ensign&rdquo; (<em>n\u0113s<\/em>) is for rallying the troops for the march or for battle (e.g. <a class=\"ref\">Jer 4:6, 21; 50:2<\/a>). In the developing Isaian literary tradition it will transmute into a rallying point for the return of dispersed Israelites (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODk1LDE3ODk3LDE4NjU5LDE4ODY1XQ==\">11:10, 12; 49:22; 62:10<\/a>). In the post-destruction period the same will happen to the vivid figure of Yahveh &ldquo;sicking&rdquo; the Assyrians on Israel by whistling (cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxNzgwMV0seyIxODAwNiI6MjV9XQ==\">7:18&ndash;19<\/a>); instead, Yahveh will whistle to call the dispersed back to the homeland (<a class=\"ref\">Zech 10:8<\/a>). Military equipment is known in some detail from the Assyrian practice of covering walls with plaques illustrating successful campaigns and the often gruesome fate of their victims. At this point only the elements that contributed most to Assyrian success in war are alluded to, i.e., archers, cavalry, and chariots.<\/p><p>As biblical records and Assyrian records and iconography attest, lions lived in close proximity to human settlements on both sides of the Euphrates during the Iron Age; in fact, lions are attested in Palestine up to the Middle Ages and in Iraq into the early years of the twentieth century. The real and dangerous proximity of these splendid animals combined with their symbolic potential will explain why they occur so frequently in the literature, including the book of Isaiah which has five terms for the lion, two of which occur in our passage. Since the lion with its fearsome roar is a prominent theme in <a class=\"ref\">Amos 1:2; 3:4, 8; 5:19<\/a>, this is another link between Amos and the Isaian tradition.<\/p><p>The final verse makes a smooth transition from the snarling and growling of lions at feeding time to the similar sound of the sea breaking on the shore (cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3OTk2XQ==\">17:12<\/a>). That the verse is editorial is evident from the &ldquo;on that day&rdquo; (<em>bayy&ocirc;m hah&ucirc;\u02be<\/em>) formula indicating what we might call a future-oriented cameo of frequent occurrence throughout the book (in chs.<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzY1NiI6MzF9\"> 1&ndash;12 see 2:20; 3:18; 4:2; 7:18, 20, 21, 23; 10:20; 11:10, 11<\/a>). It may have been added in the post-destruction period (as Clements 1980a, 70), but there is no compelling reason to exclude earlier editorial activity at this point. No attempt at deciphering this obscure verse, which has much in common with <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODMwXQ==\">8:22<\/a>, has been entirely successful. As sometimes happens in <em>bayy&ocirc;m hah&ucirc;\u02be<\/em> passages, it may express the common theme of eschatological reversal: those who are growling at and feeding on Israel now will be growled over &ldquo;from another quarter&rdquo; then (<em>v\u0115yinhom \u02bfalaw<\/em>) and will moreover be surrounded by darkness and misery.<\/p><p> Blenkinsopp, J.
