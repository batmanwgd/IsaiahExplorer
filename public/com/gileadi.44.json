They include also man and his institutions as listed in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzAyXQ==\">verses 13-16<\/a>. Isaiah makes a connection between pride and false gods (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzcwMyI6Mn0=\">vv 17-18<\/a>) to show that people have become their own gods. Instead of acknowledging their Creator as the source of their prosperity, they assume it is their own doing. By supplanting the false gods, Jehovah cuts through the spiritual blindness his people&rsquo;s idolatry has caused and reinstates a standard of values based on eternal realities&mdash;on things as they really are. <\/p> ",
