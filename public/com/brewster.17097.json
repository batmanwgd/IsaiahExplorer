    "html": "<p><b>(<a class=\"ref\">1 Nephi 21:10<\/a>).<\/b>\"<i>They shall not hunger nor thirst; neither shall the heat nor sun smite them.<\/i>\" At first glance, this may appear to be a promise of swift travel made to those returning to possess their lands of inheritance. However, placing this statement in the context of John's revelation, a new meaning is revealed. John saw in vision a future time when some \"arrayed in white robes\" would be serving God \"day and night in his temple.\" Then follows a repetition of <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NjQ3XQ==\">Isaiah 49:10<\/a>, with this added verse: \"For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters.\" (<a class=\"ref\">Revelation 7:13-17<\/a>.) The sun won't smite (burn) them because they will be spending their time in the temple. (See <a class=\"ref\">Psalm 121:6<\/a>.)<\/p>",
