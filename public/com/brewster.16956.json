An elaboration of this prophecy was revealed to the Prophet Joseph Smith. The Lord declared: \"And also cometh the testimony of the voice of thunderings, and the voice of lightnings, and the voice of tempests, and the voice of the waves of the sea heaving themselves beyond their bounds. And all things shall be in commotion; and surely, men's hearts shall fail them; for fear shall come upon all people.\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 88:90-91<\/a>.)<\/p>     <p>In addition to the great rains and hailstorms which have been forecast for the last days, inspired servants of God have spoken of fire and brimstone being rained from the heavens. (See BICQ, 33-34.)<\/p>",
