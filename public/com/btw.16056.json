In fact, this is the last verse of Isaiah 3 in the Hebrew Bible, the German Bible, and in the JST. This explains the sudden mood change from verse one to verse two. Verse one is about \"the day\" of Judah's destruction, and verse two is about the millennial day.  <\/p>  <p>  In my scriptures, I have bracketed this verse and drawn an arrow placing it at the end of 2 Nephi 13, where it makes a lot more sense.  <\/p>  <p>  <b>2 Nephi 14:1. \"Seven women shall take hold of one man\"<\/b> The footnotes in the LDS edition of the King James Bible clarify that seven women will seek one man \"because of the scarcity of men due to wars\" (Isaiah 4:1, footnotes).  <\/p>  <p>  <b>2 Nephi 14:1. \"Take away our reproach\"<\/b> What is the reproach? Footnote <i>d<\/i> to Isaiah 4:1 explains \"the stigma of being unmarried and childless.\" The situation is so desperate, that the women also offered to provide for themselves by saying, \"We will eat our own bread, and wear our own apparel,\" duties that would normally fall upon the men as providers.  <\/p>  ",
