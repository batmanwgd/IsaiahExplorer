    "html": "<p> (9) Therefore I will bewail with the weeping of Jazer . . .\u2014The prophet, in his sympathy with the sufferings of Moab (see <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3OTY2XQ==\">Isaiah 15:5<\/a>), declares that he will weep with tears as genuine as those of Jazer itself over the desolation of its vineyards.<\/p> \n<p>The shouting for thy summer fruits . . .\u2014Better, as in the margin, on thy summer-fruits, and on thy harvest a shout is fallen, i.e., not the song of the vintage gatherers and the reapers, but the cry of the enemy as they trample on the fields and vineyards. The force of the contrast is emphasised, as in <a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 48:33<\/a> (\u201ca cheer which is no cheer,\u201d Cheyne), by the use of the same word (hedad) as that which in the next verse is employed for the song of those that tread the grapes. (Comp. <a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 25:30<\/a>.) Possibly the word for \u201charvest\u201d is used generically as including the vintage.<\/p> ",
