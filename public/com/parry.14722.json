The smoke may also be connected with the eternal fires found in heaven: \"God Almighty Himself dwells in eternal fire; flesh and blood cannot go there, for all corruption is devoured by the fire. 'Our God is a consuming fire.'\" At times smoke represents the glory of God (<a class=\"ref\">Ex. 19:18; Rev. 15:8<\/a>). <\/p> ",
