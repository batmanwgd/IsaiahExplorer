With the priesthood, the Lord's people will minister the ordinances of the gospel to the world. As the Lord promised in Exodus, \"If ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant,&hellip;ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation\" (<a class=\"ref\">Ex. 19:5-6<\/a>). <\/p> <p><i>eat the riches of the Gentiles\/in their glory shall ye boast.<\/i> The priests of ancient Israel received on behalf of the Lord offerings from the people. In the same way, latter-day Zion will receive tribute (glory or wealth) for God from the nations (60:5- 11).<\/p> ",
