With the proud oppressors of his people at home, that abused their  power, to pervert justice, whom he would reckon with for their tyranny,   <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 10:1-4<\/a>.  II. With a threatening invader of his people from abroad, Sennacherib  king of Assyria, concerning whom observe,  1. The commission given him to invade Judah,   <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTc4NTY=\">Isaiah 10:5<\/a>.  2. His pride and insolence in the execution of that commission,   <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 10:7-11<\/a>.  3. A rebuke given to his haughtiness, and a threatening of his fall and  ruin, when he had served the purposes for which God raised him up,   <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTc4NjM=\">Isaiah 10:12<\/a>.  4. A promise of grace to the people of God, to enable them to bear up  under the affliction, and to get good by it,   <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 10:20-23<\/a>.  5. Great encouragement given to them not to fear this threatening  storm, but to hope that, though for the present all the country was put  into a great consternation by it, yet it would end well, in the  destruction of this formidable enemy,   <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 10:24-34<\/a>.  And this is intended to quiet the minds of good people in reference to  all the threatening efforts of the wrath of the church's enemies. If  God be for us, who can be against us? None to do us any harm.<\/p>",
