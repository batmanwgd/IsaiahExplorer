    "html": " <p>Jacob promises great blessings of joy and salvation in 2 Nephi 8 and 9 as he cites three different Isaiah chapters. Continuing his discourse after quoting Isaiah 50 in 2 Nephi 7, Jacob quotes Isaiah 51 and the first two verses of chapter 52. There are four main sections in 2 Nephi 8: a reminder to Israel of her heritage and the Lord&rsquo;s work (vv. 1&ndash;8); a promise that the righteous will enjoy the blessings of Zion (vv. 9&ndash;16); a warning and promise to the Jews in the last days (vv. 17&ndash;23); and a brief vision of Zion and Jerusalem restored to their full priesthood power (vv. 24&ndash;25). After quoting these Isaiah passages, Jacob builds upon them and delivers his profound sermon on the Atonement (2 Nephi 9). Toward the end of the sermon, Jacob quotes Isaiah 55:1&ndash;2 (2 Nephi 9:50&ndash;51), which becomes his invitation for all to come and partake of the blessings of the Redeemer&rsquo;s salvation.<\/p> ",
