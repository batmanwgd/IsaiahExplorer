    "html": "<p>Jacob promises great blessings of joy and salvation in <a class=\"ref\">2 Nephi 8 and 9<\/a> as he cites three different Isaiah chapters. Continuing his discourse after quoting <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 50<\/a> in <a class=\"ref\">2 Nephi 7<\/a>, Jacob quotes <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 51<\/a> and the first two verses of <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODY5OCI6MTV9\">chapter 52<\/a>. There are four main sections in <a class=\"ref\">2 Nephi 8<\/a>: a reminder to Israel of her heritage and the Lord&rsquo;s work (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzY1NiI6OH0=\">vv. 1&ndash;8<\/a>); a promise that the righteous will enjoy the blessings of Zion (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzY2NCI6OH0=\">vv. 9&ndash;16<\/a>); a warning and promise to the Jews in the last days (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzY3MiI6N30=\">vv. 17&ndash;23<\/a>); and a brief vision of Zion and Jerusalem restored to their full priesthood power (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzY3OSI6Mn0=\">vv. 24&ndash;25<\/a>). After quoting these Isaiah passages, Jacob builds upon them and delivers his profound sermon on the Atonement (<a class=\"ref\">2 Nephi 9<\/a>). Toward the end of the sermon, Jacob quotes <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODc0MiI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 55:1&ndash;2<\/a> (<a class=\"ref\">2 Nephi 9:50&ndash;51<\/a>), which becomes his invitation for all to come and partake of the blessings of the Redeemer&rsquo;s salvation.<\/p>",
