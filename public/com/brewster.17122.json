    "html": "<p><b><a class=\"ref\">2 Nephi 7:1-3<\/a><\/b><\/p>     <p>Monte Nyman suggests that Nephi's commentary on the quoted passages includes \"three verses from 'the prophet,' obviously Isaiah. We do not have these verses in the present Bible text, but they fit very well into the context of <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 49<\/a> and 50.\" (GAWI, 191.) These verses (<a class=\"ref\">1 Nephi 22:15-17<\/a>) can be placed between <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NjYzXQ==\">Isaiah 49:26<\/a> and 50:1. The addition of these verses adds a valuable dimension of understanding to the biblical text.<\/p>     <p>The question posed to Israel about her divorced status is a metaphorical reference to the law of divorce given in <a class=\"ref\">Deuteronomy 24:1-4<\/a>. Under this law, if a wife was found unfaithful (unclean) her husband could dissolve the marriage by giving her a \"bill of divorcement.\" Even though Israel had been unfaithful to her husband the Lord He had never given her such a document; she was never officially divorced. The Lord further states that neither has Israel been sold into bondage to relieve a debt, for He has no creditors. (At that time, one in debt could sell his children into servitude to pay the debt. See <a class=\"ref\">Exodus 21:7; Nehemiah 5:1-5<\/a>.)<\/p>     <p>The Lord reminds the people of His power to redeem them. Nothing can stay His will and stated objectives.<\/p>     <p>Verses 2-3 and the last portion of verse 11 of the Isaiahtext is repeated, with slight modifications, in <a class=\"ref\">Doctrine and Covenants 133:65-70<\/a>. <\/p>     <table>         <tbody>             <tr>                 <td><b><a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 50<\/a><br><br><br>1 <u>T<\/u>hus saith the Lord<u>,<\/u> Where is the bill of your mother's divorcement<u>,<\/u> whom <i>I have<\/i> put away<u>?<\/u> or which of my creditors <u>is it<\/u> to whom <i>I have<\/i> sold you?
