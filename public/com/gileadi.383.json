    "html": "<p>When a Sodom-and-Gomorrah type of destruction materializes, the wicked who dwell with Jehovah&rsquo;s people &ldquo;in Zion&rdquo; give way to fear and trembling. Spiritually and physically unprepared for calamity, they realize with trepidation that their end is near. Their disloyalty to Jehovah prevents them from believing that &ldquo;whatever weapon is devised against you, it shall not succeed&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzQxXQ==\">Isaiah 54:17<\/a>), or that &ldquo;whoever wars against you shall be reduced to nothing&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDY0XQ==\">Isaiah 41:12<\/a>). Physical <em>fire<\/em>&mdash;at the hands of the king of Assyria\/Babylon&mdash;and &ldquo;eternal burning&rdquo; in the hereafter await them.<\/p>",
