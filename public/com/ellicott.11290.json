In that better day men would learn to see men as they are, and not as they pretend to be. \u201cBy their fruits ye shall know them\u201d was to be one of the blessings of the reign of the true king (<a class=\"ref\">Matthew 7:20<\/a>).<\/p>\n <p>To utter error against the Lord.\u2014The \u201cerror\u201d is either that of \u201cheresy,\u201d or of hollow profession, or of open scoffing.
