And Herodotus more particularly: \u2018In the wall all round, there are a hundred gates all of brass; and so, in like manner, are the sides and the lintels.\u2019 The gates, likewise, within the city, opening to the river, from the several streets, were of brass; as were those also of the temple of Belus.\u201d <i>And I will give thee the treasures of darkness <\/i>\u2014Treasures that have been stored up, and long kept in dark and secret places, as well in Babylon (<a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 50:37 <\/a>; and <a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 51:13 <\/a>) as in other countries which Cyrus conquered, and from which, as Pliny and others relate, he took infinite treasures. \u201cSardes and Babylon,\u201d as we learn from Xenophon, \u201cwhen taken by Cyrus, were the wealthiest cities in the world. Cr\u0153sus, celebrated beyond all the kings of that age for his riches, gave up his treasures to Cyrus, with an exact account, in writing, of the whole, containing the particulars with which each wagon was loaded, when they were carried away: and they were delivered to Cyrus at the palace of Babylon. The gold and silver estimated by weight, according to the account given by Pliny, amount to 126,224,000 pounds sterling.\u201d\u2014Bishop Lowth. <i>That thou <\/i> <i>mayest know that I am the God of Israel <\/i>\u2014That I, Jehovah, who have so highly favoured thee, and have mentioned thy name so long beforehand, as the peculiar instrument of my providence, am the true God, and that Israel is my people. If this prophecy was shown to Cyrus, as Josephus says it was, <i>Antiq., <\/i>,lib. 2. cap. 2, (see note on <a class=\"ref\">Ezra 1:1 <\/a>,,) it is very reasonable to suppose, when he found his own name mentioned in it, and his achievements described so long before, he must thereby be brought to know and acknowledge the God of Israel to be the only living and true God. <\/p>,",
