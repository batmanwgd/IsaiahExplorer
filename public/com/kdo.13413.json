    "html": "<p>The prophet then proceeds to describe how the servant of Jehovah will manifest Himself in the world outside Israel by the promulgation of this right. <i>\u201cHe will not cry, nor lift up, nor cause to be heard in the street, His voice.\u201d<\/i> \u201cHis voice\u201d is the object of \u201clift up,\u201d as well as \u201ccause to be heard.\u201d With our existing division of the verse, it must at least be supplied in thought. Although he is certain of His divine call, and brings to the nations the highest and best, His manner of appearing is nevertheless quiet, gentle, and humble; the very opposite of those lying teachers, who endeavoured to exalt themselves by noisy demonstrations. He does not seek His own, and therefore denies Himself; He brings what commends itself, and therefore requires no forced trumpeting.<br><\/p>",
