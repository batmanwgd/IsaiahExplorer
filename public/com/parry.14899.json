    "html": " <i>Babylon, the glory of kingdoms.<\/i> Babylon, with its riches, glorious gardens, magnificent temples, fortressed walls, and high towers, was famous in the ancient world. It was the most glorious of the world's kingdoms. As noted elsewhere, Babylon is a symbol of the world in the last days.<\/p> <p><i>beauty of the Chaldees' excellency.<\/i> <i>Chaldean <\/i>is often \"used as a synonym for Babylonian\" (13:19; 47:1, 5; 48:14, 20). \"The <i>Chaldeans <\/i>were a group of tribes in the lower delta of the twin rivers below the most southerly Babylonian cities\" who \"had gained a leading position within Babylonia by the time of Isaiah; Merodach- baladan and Nebuchadrezzar were both Chaldeans. It was under Nebuchadrezzar (605-562 b.c.) that Babylonia reached its zenith of power, pomp and splendour, but his empire fell only a generation after his death.\" <\/p> <p> <i>shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah.<\/i> <i>Sodom<\/i> (Hebrew \"bituminous<i> <\/i>area\") and <i>Gomorrah<\/i> (Hebrew \"ruined heap\"), two biblical cities that were destroyed when God rained fire and brimstone upon them (<a class=\"ref\">Gen. 19:24-25<\/a>), are typical of any wicked city that will be destroyed by God's judgments (<a class=\"ref\">Matt. 10:15; Rom. 9:29<\/a>). According to Jude, Sodom and Gomorrah are \"set forth for an example\" of God's divine judgment on all those who are evil (<a class=\"ref\">Jude 1:7<\/a>). In the centuries following Isaiah's prophecy, Babylon was sacked and destroyed by a number of invading armies and became a heap of ruins. Similarly, the world's great cities will be destroyed at Christ's coming.<\/p> ",
