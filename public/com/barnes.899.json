    "html": "<p>The remainder of this chapter is a description of great desolation produced by the invasion of the Assyrians. &ldquo;Where there were a thousand vines.&rdquo; Where there was a valuable vineyard. In every place, that is, that was well cultivated and valuable.<\/p><p><em>At a thousand silverlings<\/em> &mdash;The word rendered &rsquo;silvertings&rsquo; here&mdash;\u05db\u05e1\u05e3 keseph&mdash;denotes, properly, silver, of any amount. But it is also used to denote the silver coin which was in use among the Jews, the shekel. Perhaps this was the only silver coin which, in early times, they possessed, and hence, the word shekel is omitted, and so many pieces of silver are mentioned. Thus, in<a class=\"ref\">Genesis 20:16<\/a> , Abimelech says, that he had given Abraham, a thousand of silver&rsquo;&mdash;that is, a thousand shekels. The shekel was worth about two shillings of our money. It is probable that a vineyard would be valued, in proportion to the number of vines that could be raised on the smallest space; and the meaning is here, that the land that was most fertile, and that produced the most, would be desolate, and would produce only briers and thorns. The land in Judea admits of a high state of cultivation, and requires it, in order to make it productive. When neglected, it becomes as remarkably sterile. At present, it generally bears the marks of great barrenness and sterility. It is under the oppression of Turkish power and exactions; and the consequence is, that, to a traveler, it has the appearance of great barrenness. But, in the high state to which the Jews brought it, it was eminently fertile, and is capable still of becoming so, if it should be placed under a government that would encourage agriculture and bestow freedom. This is the account which all travelers give of it now.<\/p> ",
