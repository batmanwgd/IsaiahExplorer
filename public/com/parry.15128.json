    "html": " <i>thou hast been a strength to the poor.<\/i> The Hebrew word for <i>strength<\/i> may be translated as \"stronghold\" (23:4), aptly describing how \"God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble\" (<a class=\"ref\">Ps. 46:1<\/a>). The poor and needy described here are not simply financially bereft; they include the poor in spirit and the meek who are willing to submit to God's will and who will inherit the earth and the kingdom of heaven (<a class=\"ref\">3 Ne. 12:5; D&amp;C 56:18-19<\/a>). The Lord's strength makes these poor and needy into \"strong people,\" standing in contrast to the strength of the rich and their \"strong city\" (<a class=\"ref\">Prov. 10:15<\/a>), which will be brought down by the Lord (25:5).<\/p> <p><i>thou hast been&hellip;a refuge from the storm.<\/i> Jehovah is our refuge from the storm, our protection from both physical and spiritual danger. He is also our \"sanctuary\" (8:14) and our \"tabernacle for a shadow in the daytime from the heat, and for a place of refuge\" (4:6).<\/p> <p><i>a shadow from the heat.<\/i> The Lord protects us from the blast, or judgments, against the wicked.<\/p> <p><i>blast of the terrible ones&hellip;storm. <\/i>The <i>blast<\/i> may refer to the Lord's judgments upon the wicked, or <i>terrible ones;<\/i> it may also refer to the battle that will be waged between Israel and the nations of the world, when the nations of the world will come close to overtaking Jerusalem. Their fury will pound against the walls of the city until the Lord comes to defend his people.<\/p> ",
