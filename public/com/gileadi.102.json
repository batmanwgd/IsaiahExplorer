    "html": "<p>There follows a classic opening-of-the mouth rite, such as also appears in Egyptian temple ordinances. The seraph&rsquo;s taking an ember from the Altar of Atonement and declaring Isaiah clean implies that atonement has been made, or will be made, for his sins and transgressions. The burning ember signifies that Isaiah&mdash;by virtue of that atonement, and through his own repentance process&mdash;has attained a purified and sanctified state and is now deemed holy. The opening-of-the-mouth rite implies the proper functioning of all the senses, physical and spiritual, as becomes evident when Isaiah is healed.<\/p> ",
