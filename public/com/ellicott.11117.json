Josephus (Ant. viii. 3. 1) fixes the date of its foundation at 240 years before Solomon.<\/p>\n <p>Her own feet shall carry her.\u2014The English version (tenable grammatically) points to the wanderings of exile. Another rendering, her feet are wont to carry her . . . is also legitimate, and fits in better with the context, which paints the past glory of Tyre in contrast with her coming calamities. So taken, the words point to her numerous colonies, of which Carthage was the chief.<\/p>",
