The &ldquo;Holy One of Israel,&rdquo; who serves as a paradigm of holiness to his people ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzU2LDE3NzczLDE3NzgzLDE3OTEwLDE4MjE3LDE4MzI5LDE4NjMyLDE4ODY3XQ==\">Isaiah 5:16; 6:3, 13; 13:3; 29:23; 35:8; 48:17; 62:12<\/a>), stands in stark contrast to the Assyrian tyrant, the unholy paradigm and<em>voice<\/em> of the wicked. By violating the rights of Jehovah&rsquo;s covenant people, the king of Assyria unwittingly brings upon himself the curses of the covenant Jehovah made with them.<\/p> ",
