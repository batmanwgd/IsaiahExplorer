It is transitory and not of an eternal nature. It consists of the learning of those who 'hearken not unto the counsel of God, for they set it aside, supposing they know of themselves, wherefore, their wisdom is foolishness and it profiteth them not' (<a class=\"ref\">2 Ne. 9:28<\/a>).\" (DCE, 643.) The apostle Paul described such wisdom well when he said that those who pursue this course are \"ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.\" (<a class=\"ref\">2 Timothy 3:7<\/a>.)<\/p>",
