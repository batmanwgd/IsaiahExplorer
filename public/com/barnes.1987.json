    "html": "<p><em>But now, O Lord, thou art our Father<\/em>&mdash;(See the notes at <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODgzXQ==\">Isaiah 63:16<\/a>).<\/p><p><em>We are the clay<\/em>&mdash;The idea seems to be, that their condition then had been produced by him as clay is moulded by the potter, and that they were to be returned and restored entirely by him&mdash;as they had no more power to do it than the clay had to shape itself. The sense is, that they were wholly in his hand and at his disposal (see the notes at <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MjEwLDE4NTcxXQ==\">Isaiah 29:16; Isaiah 45:9<\/a>).<\/p><p><em>And thou our potter<\/em>&mdash;Thou hast power to mould us as the potter does the clay.<\/p><p><em>And we all are the work of thy hand<\/em>&mdash;That is, as the vessel made by the potter is his work. We have been formed by thee, and we are dependent on thee to make us what thou wilt have us to be. This whole verse is an acknowledgment of the sovereignty of God. It expresses the feeling which all have when under conviction of sin; and when they are sensible that they are exposed to the divine displeasure for their transgressions. Then they feel that if they are to be saved, it must be by the mere sovereignty of God; and then they implore his interposition to &lsquo;mould and guide them at his will.&rsquo;<\/p> ",
