    "html": "<p> (4) For thou hast broken the yoke of his burden . . .\u2014The text comes in the Hebrew with all the emphasis of position. The yoke of his burden . . . thou hast broken. The phrase suggests a bondage like that of Egypt, where the \u201ctask-masters\u201d (the same word as that here rendered \u201coppressors\u201d) drove the people to their labours with their rods.<\/p> \n<p>As in the day of Midian.\u2014The historical allusion was probably suggested by the division of spoil that had been in the prophet\u2019s thoughts. Of all victories in the history of Israel, that of Gideon over the Midianites had been most conspicuous for this feature ( <a class=\"ref\">Judges 8:24-27<\/a>). In <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 83:9-11<\/a> (which the mention of Assur shows to have been nearly contemporary with Isaiah) we find a reference to the same battle. Men remembered \u201cthe day of Midian\u201d centuries after its date, as we remember Poitiers and Agincourt.<\/p> ",
