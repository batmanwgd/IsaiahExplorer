(<a class=\"ref\">Zechariah 13:6; 3 Nephi 11:14<\/a>.) This could also have reference to the ancient custom of tattooing sacred images or symbols on one's palms as a constant reminder of that to which one was devoted. In Isaiah's imagery, the Lord could not use His hands without being reminded of Israel.<\/p>",
