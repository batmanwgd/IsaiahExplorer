Nevertheless, the Book of Mormon prophet Abinadi provides an answer to Isaiah's query, \"Who shall declare his generation?\"<\/p>     <p>\"Behold I say unto you, that whosoever has heard the words of the prophets, yea, all the holy prophets who have prophesied concerning the coming of the Lord I say unto you, that all those who have hearkened unto their words, and believed that the Lord would redeem his people, and have looked forward to that day for a remission of their sins, I say unto you, that these are his seed, or they are the heirs of the kingdom of God. . . .<\/p>     <p>\"Yea, and are not the prophets, every one that has opened his mouth to prophesy, that has not fallen into transgression, I mean all the holy prophets ever since the world began? I say unto you that they are his seed.\" (<a class=\"ref\">Mosiah 15:10-13<\/a>.)<\/p>",
