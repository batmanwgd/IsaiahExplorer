    "html": "<p><em> \u201cWoe unto them that join house to house, who lay field to field, till there is no more room, and ye alone are dwelling in the midst of the land.\u201d<\/em> The participle is continued in the finite verb, as in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzYzLDE3ODUyXQ==\">Isaiah 5:23; Isaiah 10:1<\/a>; the regular syntactic construction is cases of this kind (Ges. \u00a7134, Anm. 2). The preterites after \u201ctill\u201d (there are to such preterites, for <em> 'ephes <\/em> is an intensified \u05d0\u05d9\u05df enclosing the verbal idea) correspond to future perfects: \u201cThey, the insatiable, would not rest till, after every smaller piece of landed property had been swallowed by them, the whole land had come into their possession, and no one beside themselves was settled in the land\u201d (<a class=\"ref\">Job 22:8<\/a>). Such covetousness was all the more reprehensible, because the law of Israel and provided so very stringently and carefully, that as far as possible there should be an equal distribution of the soil, and that hereditary family property should be inalienable. All landed property that had been alienated reverted to the family every fiftieth year, or year of jubilee; so that alienation simply had reference to the usufruct of the land till that time. It was only in the case of houses in towns that the right of redemption was restricted to one year, at least according to a later statute. How badly the law of the year of jubilee had been observed, may be gathered from Jer 34, where we learn that the law as to the manumission of Hebrew slaves in the sabbatical year had fallen entirely into neglect. Isaiah's contemporary, Micah, makes just the same complaint as Isaiah himself (vid., <a class=\"ref\">Micah 2:2<\/a>).<\/p>",
