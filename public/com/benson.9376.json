Perhaps the prophet may chiefly intend the priests and other teachers of the Jews, who, as they were appointed to instruct the people in the right way of worshipping and serving God, so they had peculiar advantages for knowing that way themselves, having the oracles of God in their hands, and much leisure for reading and considering them. Or he may be understood as speaking sarcastically, and terming them<i> perfect,<\/i> or,<i> perfectly instructed,<\/i> because they pretended to greater knowledge and piety than others, to a more perfect acquaintance with, and conformity to, the divine will, proudly calling themselves<i> rabbis<\/i> and<i> masters,<\/i> and despising the people as cursed and not knowing the law,<a class=\"ref\">John 7:49<\/a> ; and deriding Christ for calling them<i> blind,<\/i><a class=\"ref\">John 9:40<\/a> .<i> And blind as the Lord\u2019s servant?<\/i> \u2014 Which title, as it was given to the Jewish people in the first clause of the verse, may be here given to the priests, because they were called and obliged to be the Lord\u2019s servants, in a special manner.<i> Seeing many things, but thou observest not<\/i> \u2014 Thou dost not seriously consider the plain word and wonderful works of God.<\/p> ",
