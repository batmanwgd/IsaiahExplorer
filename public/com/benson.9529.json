    "html": "<p><a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 58:8<\/a>.<i>Then shall thy light <\/i>\u2014 Matter or cause of rejoicing, <i>break forth as the morning <\/i>\u2014 Arise as certainly and speedily as in the morning the light arises out of darkness. It shall not only <i>appear, <\/i>but <i>break, <\/i>or dart itself <i>forth, <\/i>notwithstanding all obstructions, as the sun breaks and pierces through a cloud. So ready is God to help his people when they are truly humbled! Thus quickly and clearly does salvation break forth upon them! <i>And thy health shall spring forth speedily <\/i>\u2014 The recovery of thy former prosperous condition. Another metaphor to express the same thing. <i>And <\/i><i>thy righteousness shall go before thee <\/i>\u2014 To prepare thy way to safety and happiness; ensuring to thee, O my church, the peculiar direction and care of thy God, and the favour and approbation of wise and good men; see <a class=\"ref\">Romans 14:17-18<\/a>. Or manifold blessings shall be bestowed upon thee, upon all occasions, as the reward of thy righteousness. <i>The glory of the Lord shall be thy rereward <\/i>\u2014 The glorious presence, power, and providence of God shall protect and secure thee. Thus the angel of his presence secured the Israelites when they came up out of Egypt. Or, the meaning may be, A glorious state shall succeed this thy present calamitous condition.<\/p>",
