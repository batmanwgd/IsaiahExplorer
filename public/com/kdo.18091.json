    "html": "<p> The second half is uttered in the prospect, that the judgment which Cyrus brings upon the nations will prepare the way for the overthrow of heathenism, and the universal acknowledgment of the God of Israel. The heathen submit, as the first strophe or group of vv. (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODU3NiI6NH0=\">Isaiah 45:14-17<\/a>) affirms, to the congregation and its God; the idolatrous are converted, whilst Israel is for ever redeemed. With the prospect of the release of the exiles, there is associated in the prophet's perspective the prospect of an expansion of the restored church, through the entrance of \u201cthe fulness of the Gentiles.\u201d <em> \u201cThus saith Jehovah, The productions of Egypt, and gain of Ethiopia, and the Sabaeans, men of tall stature, will come over to thee, and belong to thee: they will come after thee; in chains they will come over, and cast themselves down to thee; they pray to thee, Surely God is in thee, and there is none else; no Deity at all.\u201d<\/em> Assuming that \u05d9\u05e2\u05d1\u05e8\u05d5\u05bc has the same meaning in both cases, the prophet's meaning appears to be, that the Egyptians, Ethiopians, and Meroites (see <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NTA5XQ==\">Isaiah 43:3<\/a>), who had been enslaved by the imperial power of Persia, would enter the miraculously emancipated congregation of Israel (Ewald). But if they were thought of as in a state of subjugation to the imperial power of Asia, who could the promise be at the same time held out that their riches would pass over into the possession of the church? And yet, on the other hand, the chains in which they come over cannot be regarded, at least in this connection, where such emphasis is laid upon the voluntary character of the surrender, as placed upon them by Israel itself (as in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODMzXQ==\">Isaiah 60:11<\/a> and <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 149:8<\/a>). We must therefore suppose that they put chains upon themselves voluntarily, and of their own accord, and thus offer themselves spontaneously to the church, to be henceforth its subjects and slaves. Egypt, Ethiopia, and Saba are the nations that we meet with in other passages, where the <em> haereditas gentium <\/em> is promised to the church, and generally in connection with Tyre (vid., <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 68:32; Psalms 72:10<\/a>; compare <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MDA1LDE4MDIxLDE4MDk2XQ==\">Isaiah 18:7; Isaiah 19:16., Isaiah 23:18<\/a>). Whilst the labour of Egypt (i.e., the productions of its labour) and the trade of Ethiopia (i.e., the riches acquired by trade) are mentioned; in the case of Saba the prophecy looks at the tall and handsome tribe itself, a tribe which Agatharchides describes as having \u03c3\u03c9\u0301\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1 \u03b1\u0313\u03be\u03b9\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03c9\u0301\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1 . These would place themselves at the service of the church with their invincible strength. The voluntary character of the surrender is pointed out, not only in the expression \u201cthey will come over,\u201d but also in the confession with which this is accompanied. In other cases the words <em> hithpalle\u0304l 'el <\/em> are only used of prayer to God and idols; but here it is to the church that prayer is offered. In the prophet's view, Jehovah and His church are inseparably one (compare <a class=\"ref\">1 Corinthians 12:12<\/a>, where \u201cChrist\u201d stands for the church as one body, consisting of both head and members; also the use of the word \u201cworship\u201d in <a class=\"ref\">Revelation 3:9<\/a>, which has all the ring of a passage taken from Isaiah). \u05d0 \u05da is used here in its primary affirmative sense, as in <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 58:11<\/a>. There can be no doubt that Paul had this passage of Isaiah in his mind when writing <a class=\"ref\">1 Corinthians 14:24-25<\/a>, \u03b1\u0313\u03c0\u03b1\u03b3\u03b3\u03b5\u0301\u03bb\u03bb\u03c9\u03bd \u03bf\u0314\u0301\u03c4\u03b9 \u03bf\u0314 \u0398\u03b5\u03bf\u0300\u03c2 \u03bf\u0313\u0301\u03bd\u03c4\u03c9\u03c2 \u03b5\u0313\u03bd \u03c5\u0314\u03bc\u03b9\u0342\u03bd \u03b5\u0313\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u0301 , or, according to a better arrangement of the words, \u03bf\u0314\u0301\u03c4\u03b9 \u03bf\u0313\u0301\u03bd\u03c4\u03c9\u03c2 (= \u05d0 \u05da ) \u03bf\u0314 \u0398\u03b5\u03bf\u0300\u03c2 \u03b5\u0313\u03bd \u03c5\u0314\u03bc\u03b9\u0342\u03bd \u03b5\u0313\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u0301\u03bd . <em> 'Ephes <\/em> does not signify <em> praeter <\/em> (as a synonym of \u05d1\u05bc\u05dc\u05e2\u05d3\u05d9 , \u05d6\u05d5\u05bc\u05dc\u05ea\u05d9 ) either here or anywhere else, but is a substantive used with a verbal force, which stands in the same relation to \u05d0\u05d9\u05df as \u201cthere is not at all (absolutely not)\u201d to \u201cthere is not;\u201d compare <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzQ4LDE4NTY4LDE4NTk2XQ==\">Isaiah 5:8; Isaiah 45:6; Isaiah 46:9<\/a>, also <a class=\"ref\">Deuteronomy 32:36<\/a> (derivative passage, <a class=\"ref\">2 Kings 14:26<\/a>), and <a class=\"ref\">Amos 6:10; 2 Samuel 9:3<\/a>; vid., <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NjA4XQ==\">Isaiah 47:8<\/a>.<\/p>",
