The phrase <i>in the night<\/i> may mean that Moab's cities will be destroyed with such great force and speed, it will be as if the destruction took place without warning in a single night. The expression <i>brought to silence<\/i> indicates that the devastation was so complete that no inhabitants remained in the cities, meaning no conversations among adults, no children playing in the streets, and no bustling noise in the marketplaces.<\/p> ",
