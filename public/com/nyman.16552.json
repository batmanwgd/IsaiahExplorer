The analogy of a bride is used because a bride is traditionally very meticulous in her dress and grooming on her wedding day. The land which has lain waste and desolate will be built up until man will reason that it is too small for the multitude which will come to it. These multitudes will come from afar seeking freedom because their former lands were too restrictive, \"too strait.\" This will happen after the time when the \"first\" of Joseph's children (note the Book of Mormon retention in verse 20)-the Nephites-shall have forfeited their blessings in this choice land above all other lands. The migrations to come are going to be so numerous that it will astonish the land of Zion, who was previously complaining that the Lord had forgotten her.<\/p>     ",
