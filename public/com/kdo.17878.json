We recall to mind <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 24:1-10<\/a>, but the scene is a different one. The author of Ps 118 has given individuality to this passage in <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 118:19, Psalms 118:20<\/a>. <em> Goi tzaddik <\/em> (a righteous nation) is the church of the righteous, as in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTEyXQ==\">Isaiah 24:16<\/a>. <em> Goi <\/em> (nation) is used here, as in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTQ2XQ==\">Isaiah 26:15<\/a> and <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODMyXQ==\">Isaiah 9:2<\/a>, with reference to Israel, which has now by grace become a righteous nation, and has been established in covenant truth towards God, who keepeth truth (<em> 'emunim <\/em> , from <em> 'e\u0304mu\u0304n <\/em> , <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 31:24<\/a>).<\/p>",
