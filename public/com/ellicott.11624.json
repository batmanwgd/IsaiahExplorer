The next phrase, \u201clawful captive,\u201d literally \u201ccaptive of righteousness,\u201d may mean, (1) as in the Authorised version a captive whom the conqueror had a right to take, or (2) one who was righteous and yet had been given into captivity. Neither meaning is quite satisfactory. A conjectural emendation gives the captives of the terrible one, which fits in with the parallelism of the next verse.<\/p> ",
