How better could 'their horses' hoofs be counted like flint, and their wheel like a whirlwind' than in the modern train? How better could 'Their roaring \u2026 be like a lion' than in the roar of the airplane?\" (MWW, 236.) To Isaiah, these future modes of transportation probably looked like great beasts which took their prey (passengers) to a safe destination.<\/p>     <p>At least one author suggests this may also depict missionaries traveling to the ends of the earth to gather converts who are safely enfolded within Zion's tent. (IPSP, 123.)<\/p>",
