    "html": "<p>Isaiah&rsquo;s &ldquo;Babylon&rdquo; historically encompassed not only the ancient city of Babylon but the entire idolatrous, materialistic empire under Babylon&rsquo;s influence, including nations in league with Babylon against an ascendant Assyria. Isaiah&rsquo;s oracles against these nations in chapters 13-23, together with chapter 47 which addresses the Woman Babylon, form Part IV of Isaiah&rsquo;s Seven-Part Structure whose key themes are humiliation and exaltation. In an end-time context, this Greater Babylon represents a wicked world on the eve of its destruction and resembles John&rsquo;s &ldquo;Babylon the Great&rdquo; (<a class=\"ref\">Revelation 17-18<\/a>).<\/p> ",
