    "html": " <i>Lord maketh the earth empty.<\/i> This refers to the destruction of the earth's inhabitants at the Second Coming. A modern revelation uses similar language: \"For a desolating scourge shall go forth among the inhabitants of the earth, and shall continue to be poured out from time to time, if they repent not, until <i>the earth is empty, and the inhabitants thereof are consumed away and utterly destroyed<\/i> by the brightness of my coming\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 5:19<\/a>). <\/p> <p><i>maketh it waste.<\/i> The judgments that precede the second coming of Christ will turn the earth into a wasteland (<a class=\"ref\">Rev. 8:7-12<\/a>). <\/p> <p><i>turneth it upside down.<\/i> Similar imagery was used in the Lord's declaration, \"I will wipe Jerusalem as a man wipeth a dish, wiping it, and <i>turning it upside down<\/i>\" (<a class=\"ref\">2 Kgs. 21:13<\/a>). The Lord will cleanse the earth of the wicked as one turns a bowl upside down and empties, or pours out, the filth.<\/p> <p> <i>scattereth abroad the inhabitants.<\/i> The Lord scatters the world's inhabitants (<a class=\"ref\">Gen. 11:8-9<\/a>) as punishment for wickedness (<a class=\"ref\">Ps. 92:9<\/a>). <\/p> ",
