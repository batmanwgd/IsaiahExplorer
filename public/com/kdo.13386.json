Then came Eliakim son of Hilkiyahu <\/i> (K. <i>Hilkiyah <\/i>) <i>, the house-minister, and Shebna the chancellor, and Joah son of Asaph, the recorder, to Hizkiyahu, with torn clothes, and told him the words of Rabshakeh.\u201d <\/i> It is only a superficial observation that could commend the reading in Kings, \u201cThey, the people, held their peace,\u201d which Hitzig and Knobel prefer, but which Luzzatto very properly rejects. As the Assyrians wished to speak to the king himself (<a class=\"ref\">2 Kings 18:18<\/a>), who sent the three to them as his representatives, the command to hear, and to make no reply, can only have applied to them (and they had already made the matter worse by the one remark which they had made concerning the language); and the reading <span class=\"normal hebrew\"> \u05d5\ufb39\u05d7\u05e8\u05d9\u05e9\u05c1\ufb35 <\/span> in the text of Isaiah is the correct one. The three were silent, because the king had imposed the duty of silence upon them; and regarding themselves as dismissed, inasmuch as Rabshakeh had turned away from them to the people, they hastened to the king, rending their clothes, in despair and grief and the disgrace they had experienced. <br> <\/p> ",
