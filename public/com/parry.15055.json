    "html": " <i>Elam bare the quiver with chariots of men and horsemen.<\/i> In this passage, Elam's famed archers (<a class=\"ref\">Jer. 49:34-39<\/a>) pull their arrows from their quivers and set them in their bows, ready to battle against Jerusalem. Earlier, Isaiah heard the war cry of an army captain commanding Elam to go to battle against Babylon (21:2).<\/p> <p><i>Kir uncovered the shield.<\/i> <i>Kir<\/i> was a Mesopotamian city situated east of the Tigris River on the main highway that ran from Elam to Babylon. A leather covering protected a warrior's shield when it was not in use, and the phrase <i>uncovered the shield<\/i> indicates that Kir's warriors held their shields in readiness; it parallels the anticipation of Elam's soldiers who had their arrows removed from the quivers, ready for an impending battle.<\/p> ",
