McConkie. \"The leaders of the people rejected his words when he preached in the temple at Passover time. The common people of Nazareth hardened their hearts against his words when he spoke to them in their synagogue. And so it would be throughout his whole ministry; save for a few believing souls, he was 'despised and rejected of men' (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzE1XQ==\">Isa. 53:3<\/a>) and eventually <i>his own <\/i>would&hellip;[c]rucify him.\" <\/p> <p> <i>hid&hellip;our faces.<\/i> The Living Bible says, \"We turned our backs on him and looked the other way when he went by.\" A note in the Jerusalem Bible says that this \"expression was used of lepers.\" In other words, not only did people refuse to follow him but they shunned him. Even though many people followed Christ for a time, in the end most turned from him. The same is true of people in all ages\u2014most (\"we\") turn from a full and correct understanding of Jesus Christ and his gospel.<\/p> <p><i>despised\/esteemed him not.<\/i> Though Christ had a few who followed him and remained faithful to the end, most viewed him as one of no worth.<\/p> ",
