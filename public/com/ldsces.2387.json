It is likely that the purpose in her captivity was at least twofold: to humble proud and wicked Israel, and to have indisputable cause for destroying Babylon and showing the world that this attractive &ldquo;daughter of the Chaldeans&rdquo; was a poor one to emulate, for she would be no more (see <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODYwMSI6Nn0=\">Isaiah 47:1&ndash;6 <\/a>). And all of this would be as sure as the destruction of the Egyptians in the days of Moses, which had become legendary. <\/p> <p class=\"cite\"> LDS Church Educational System Old Testament Student Manual, 1 Kings&ndash;Malachi, Religion 302, Chapter 16, Item 26 <\/p> ",
