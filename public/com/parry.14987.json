North and South America, are the symbols of the wings.\" <\/p> <p>Apparently the woe does not belong in the introduction to 18:1. \"The chapter shows clearly that no woe was intended, but rather a greeting&hellip;. A correct translation would be, 'Hail to the land in the shape of wings.'\" <\/p> ",
