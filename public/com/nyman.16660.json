Even though there is no unanimity of opinion among the translations or the commentators, the outline seems to be consistent with the chronology and theology of the events of the last days which are being summarized. The only help within other scriptures comes from <a class=\"ref\">Rev. 12:1-5<\/a>, which sheds light on verse 7. Here John saw a woman in travail bringing forth a man child. Elder Bruce R. McConkie has identified this man child as the kingdom of God (see DNTC, 3:516). While the context of these verses in the book of Revelation is in the meridian of time, while Isaiah is speaking of the last days, the identification of the man child would still be the same.<\/p>     ",
