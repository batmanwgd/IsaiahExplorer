While one further passage will address idols (46:1\u20137), it lacks the intensity and the air of judicial challenge that comes to its climax here. The diatribe here reflects the trajectory that has developed in the earlier ones. Initially, the case against the idol gods was focused on their inability to explain the meaning of the past and tell the future (41:21\u201329). In the second presentation of the case (43:8\u201313), another element was added: their inability to save their people or prevent Yahweh from saving his people from them. Now in this third presentation, although their inability to predict the future takes first place (44:7\u20138), it is quickly succeeded by their inability to save, and that issue takes up the rest of the case. The statement of the case begins in 44:6\u20138 with another claim to absolute uniqueness by God. The body of the charges is presented in 44:9\u201320. Finally, 44:21\u201322 forms the conclusion by issuing a call for Israel to take to heart all that this means for what their God can, and will, do for them. Like the other presentations of the case against the idols, this one has an \u201cevangelical\u201d function. It is not a cool philosophical discourse but attempts to convince apathetic, discouraged people not to put their hopes in things that will ultimately fail them; they must wait confidently and expectantly for what the one God, the Creator, their Holy One, will do for them.<\/p>     ",
