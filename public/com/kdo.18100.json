    "html": "<p> The negative answer to this question is the direct result of what precedes, but a still further proof is given in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NTkzLDE4NTk0XQ==\">Isaiah 46:6, Isaiah 46:7<\/a>. <em> \u201cThey who pour gold out of the bag, and weigh silver with the balance, hire a goldsmith to make it into a god, that they may fall down, yea, throw themselves down. They lift it up, carry it away upon their shoulder, and set it down in its place: there it stands; from its place it does not move: men also cry to it, but it does not answer; it saves no one out of distress.\u201d<\/em> There is no necessity for assuming that \u05d4\u05d6\u05bc\u05dc\u05d9\u05dd is used in the place of the finite verb, as Hitzig imagines, or as equivalent to \u05d6\u05dc\u05d9\u05dd \u05d4\u05dd , as Rosenm\u00fcller and Gesenius suppose; but up to \u05d9\u05e9\u05c2\u05db\u05bc\u05e8\u05d5\u05bc the whole is subject, and therefore \u05d9\u05e9\u05c1\u05e7\u05dc\u05d5\u05bc is the point at which the change into the finite verb occurs (Ges. \u00a7131, 2). The point in <em> hazza\u0302l\u0131\u0304m <\/em> is not the extravagant expenditure, as Ewald thinks, but the mean origin of the god, which commences with the pouring out of gold from a purse (<em> zu\u0304l <\/em> = <em> za\u0302lal <\/em> , to shake, to pour out). <em> Qa\u0302neh <\/em> is the lever of the scales ( \u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03c9\u0301\u03bd ). The metal weighed out is given to a goldsmith, who plates the idol with the gold, and makes the ornaments for it of silver. When it is finished, they lift it up, or shoulder it ( \u05d9\u05e9\u05bc\u05c2\u05d0\u05d4\u05d5\u05bc with a distinctive Great Telisha), carry it home, and set it down in the place which it is to have <em> under it<\/em> ( \u05ea\u05bc\u05d7\u05ea\u05bc\u05d9\u05d5 ). There it stands firm, immoveable, and also deaf and dumb, hearing no one, answering no one, and helping no one. The subject to \u05d9\u05e6\u05e2\u05e7 is any \u05e6\u05e2\u05e7 . The first admonition closes here. The gods who are carried fall without being able to save themselves, whereas Israel's God carries and saves His people; He, the Incomparable, more especially in contrast with the lifeless puppets of idols.<\/p>",
