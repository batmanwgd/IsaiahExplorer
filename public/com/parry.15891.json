Moreover, Jesus compared the kingdom of heaven to a net cast into the sea, which then drew forth many fishes (<a class=\"ref\">Matt. 13:47-48<\/a>). In this symbolism, the sea is the earth, and the fishes are those brought into the Lord's kingdom, or the <i>abundance of the sea.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>forces of the Gentiles.<\/i> The riches or wealth or power of the nations will come to strengthen Zion (60:11).
