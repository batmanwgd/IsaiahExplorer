    "html": "<p>Isaiah's writings in chapter 52 are referenced by the apostles John and Paul in the New Testament (<a class=\"ref\">Revelation 18:4; 2 Corinthians 6:17<\/a>); quoted by such Book of Mormon prophets as Nephi (<a class=\"ref\">1 Nephi 22:10-11<\/a>), Jacob (<a class=\"ref\">2 Nephi 8:24-25<\/a>), Abinadi (<a class=\"ref\">Mosiah 12:21-24; 15:29-31<\/a>), and Moroni (<a class=\"ref\">Moroni 10:31<\/a>); taught by the resurrected Lord in the ancient Americas (<a class=\"ref\">3 Nephi 16<\/a>, 20, 21); and found sprinkled throughout the Doctrine and Covenants (e.g., <a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 38:42; 82:14; 84:98-99<\/a>).<\/p>     <p>This is a chapter of hope, focusing on the house of Israel in the last days. Verses 8 10 of the Isaiah text are obviously significant, for they are quoted four times in the Book of Mormon, twice by Jesus Himself. He first recited these verses at the conclusion of His teachings as recorded in <a class=\"ref\">3 Nephi 16<\/a>, which included prophecies about the last days. He introduced the Old Testament seer's words by saying, \"And then the words of the prophet Isaiah shall be fulfilled.\" (<a class=\"ref\">3 Nephi 16:17<\/a>.) The people were then told to go to their homes to ponder and pray about His teachings and to prepare their minds for subsequent teachings the following day. (<a class=\"ref\">3 Nephi 17:3<\/a>.)<\/p>     <p>The next day the Savior quoted <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 54<\/a> in its entirety, slightly reordering the verses and omitting only verses 4 and 5. These verses may have been left out because they touched on Assyrian oppression during Isaiah's day a circumstance which had no direct application to the Nephites or to the message of the last days which Jesus was teaching at that moment.<\/p>     <p>His message was that the gospel was to be taken throughout the earth in the last days by His chosen messengers and that Israel was to be gathered from the many nations of the world. To get a full appreciation of Isaiah's words, they should be read in the context of the Lord's teachings to the ancient Nephites in 3 Nephi.<\/p>",
