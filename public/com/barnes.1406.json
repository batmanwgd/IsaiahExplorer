    "html": "<p><em>And the streams thereof<\/em>&mdash;The idea here is, that there would be as great and awful a destruction as if the streams everywhere should become pitch or resin, which would be set on fire, and which would fill the land with flame. This image is very striking, as we may see by supposing the rivers and streams in any land to flow not with water, but with heated pitch, turpentine, or tar, and that this was all suddenly kindled into a flame. It cannot be supposed that this is to be taken literally. The image is evidently taken from the destruction of Sodom and Gamorrah ( <a class=\"ref\">Genesis 19:25-28<\/a>), an image which is more fully used in reference to the same subject in <a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 49:17-18<\/a>: &lsquo;And Edom shall be a desolation;... as in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah, and the neighbor cities thereof, saith the Lord, no man shall abide there, neither shall a son of man dwell in it.&rsquo;<\/p><p><em>And the dust thereof into brimstone<\/em>&mdash;The ruin shall be as entire as if all the soil were turned into brimstone, which should be ignited and left burning.<\/p> ",
