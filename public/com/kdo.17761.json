To execute His wrath He had summoned His \u201csanctified ones\u201d (<em> m e kudda\u0302shim <\/em> ), i.e., according to <a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 22:7<\/a> (compare <a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 51:27-28<\/a>), those who had already been solemnly consecrated by Him to go into the battle, and had called the heroes whom He had taken into His service, and who were His instruments in this respect, that they rejoiced with the pride of men intoxicated with victory (vid., <a class=\"ref\">Zephaniah 1:7<\/a>, cf., <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzE5XQ==\">Isaiah 3:11<\/a>). \u05e2\u05dc\u05d9\u05d6 is a word peculiarly Isaiah's; and the combination \u05d2\u05d0\u05d5\u05d4 \u05e2\u05dc\u05d9\u05d6\u05d9 is so unusual, that we could hardly expect to find it employed by two authors who stood in no relation whatever to one another.<\/p>",
