There the picture was that of a strong vigorous shoot coming out of the root of the house of David. Here the sapling is weak and frail, struggling out of the dry ground. For \u201cbefore Him\u201d (i.e., Jehovah) some critics have read \u201cbefore us,\u201d as agreeing better with the second clause; while others have referred the pronoun \u201chim\u201d to the Jewish people. Taking the received text and interpretation, the thought expressed is that Jehovah was watching this humble and lowly growth, as a mother watches over her weakest and most sickly child.<\/p> \n<p>He hath no form nor comeliness.\u2014See Note on<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzIyXQ==\">Isaiah 3:14<\/a> .
