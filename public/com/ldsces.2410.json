We do not have these verses in the present Bible text, but they fit very well into the context of<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 49<\/a> and 50. We can illustrate this by placing [<a class=\"ref\">1 Nephi 22:15&ndash;17<\/a> ] between the last verse of chapter 49 and the first verse of chapter 50.&rdquo; (<em>&ldquo;Great Are the Words of Isaiah,&rdquo;<\/em> p. 191.)<\/p><p class=\"cite\"> LDS Church Educational System Old Testament Student Manual, 1 Kings&ndash;Malachi, Religion 302, Chapter 17, Item 10<\/p> ",
