As &ldquo;slayers of children&rdquo; who &ldquo;burn with lust&rdquo; in a counterfeit paradise (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3Njg0LDE4NzcxXQ==\">Isaiah 1:29; 57:5<\/a>), these Perdition types are not only made an end of physically in Jehovah&rsquo;s Day of Judgment but also spiritually. In that day, their particular Covenant with Death&mdash;their sacrilegious contract with the powers of darkness&mdash;becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy: &ldquo;They are dead, to live no more, spirits who will not rise up; you appoint them to destruction, wiping out all recollection of them&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTQ1XQ==\">Isaiah 26:14<\/a>; cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4OTQ3XQ==\">v 24<\/a>). <\/p> ",
