The latter would include pornography in all its forms, including filthy jokes, sleazy magazines, and so-called adult entertainment. It would include those who cheat, steal, lie, embezzle, perjure, or prevaricate in any way. In essence, it is any who are not following the Lord's admonition to \"stand ye in holy places, and be not moved.\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 87:8<\/a>.)<\/p>     <p>In our dispensation the Lord declared, \"They that have watched for iniquity shall be hewn down and cast into the fire.\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 45:50<\/a>; see also DCE, 66.) They will be cut off from the presence of the Lord.<\/p>",
