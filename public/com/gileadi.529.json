    "html": "<p>Jehovah again appears as creator of the heavens and the earth before he validates his servant as one whom he &ldquo;rightfully raises up&rdquo; or &ldquo;raises up in\/as righteousness&rdquo; (<em>ha&lsquo;irotihu<\/em> <em>besedeq<\/em>). Forming an integral part of the servant&rsquo;s end-time mission are two things for which Cyrus set a precedent: (1) the rebuilding of &ldquo;my city&rdquo;&mdash;Jerusalem (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 44:26, 28<\/a>); and (2) the release of Jehovah&rsquo;s &ldquo;exiles&rdquo; or captives who are exiled among the nations (42:7; 49:9). Jehovah&rsquo;s appointing the host of heaven with his <em>hand<\/em> identifies Jehovah and his servant as co-creators and empowerers (cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 40:12, 26; 41:20<\/a>).<\/p>",
