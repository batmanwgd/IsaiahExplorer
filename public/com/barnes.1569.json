Gesenius supposes that this is a corrupt reading for \u05d0\u05e4\u05e1 &lsquo;epes (nothing), and so our translators have regarded it, and in this opinion most expositors agree. Hahn has adopted this reading in his Hebrew Bible. The Jewish rabbis suppose generally that the word \u05d0\u05e4\u05e2 &lsquo;epa\u201b is the same word as \u05d0\u05e4\u05e2\u05d4 &lsquo;eph\u201beh, a viper, according to the reading in the margin. But this interpretation is contrary to the connection, as well as the ancient versions. The Vulgate and Chaldee render it, &lsquo;Of nought.&rsquo; The Syriac renders it, &lsquo;Your works are of the sword.&rsquo; This is probably one of the few instances in which there has been a corruption of the Hebrew text (compare <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDM4XQ==\">Isaiah 40:17 <\/a>; <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDY0XQ==\">Isaiah 41:12 <\/a>,, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDcxXQ==\">Isaiah 41:19 <\/a>). <\/p> <p> <em>An abomination is he that chooseth you <\/em>&mdash;They who select idols as the object of worship, and offer to them homage, are regarded as abominable by God. <\/p>,",
