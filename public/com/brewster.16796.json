The changed text in the Book of Mormon as well as other scriptural commentary provides understanding for otherwise difficult passages in verses 9 and 10.<\/p>     <p>Isaiah asks the Lord how long the hardhearted people will reject the message. The Lord's answer is not comforting. Yet, the final verse of the chapter gives hope that there will yet be a remnant of the people who will be redeemed.<\/p>     <table>         <tbody>             <tr>                 <td>9 And he said<u>,<\/u> Go, and tell this people<u>,<\/u> Hear ye indeed, but <i>understand<\/i> not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not.                     <br>                     <br>10 Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes<u>;<\/u> lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and convert<u>,<\/u> and be healed.                     <br>                     <br>11 Then said I<u>,<\/u> Lord, how long?
