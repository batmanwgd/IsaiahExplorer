    "html": "<p>After two chapters of personal but inspired commentary (<a class=\"ref\">2 Nephi 25<\/a> and 26), in which he has borne powerful witness to the divine nature and mission of Jesus Christ, Nephi returns to recording the writings of Isaiah. He quotes the Old Testament seer to show that Isaiah knew of the latter-day coming forth of the Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ.<\/p>     <p>Just as Isaiah's messianic prophecies in ancient times bore strong testimony to the coming of Jesus Christ, so a strong scriptural witness for Jesus Christ in the latter days would speak from the pages of another scriptural record which Isaiah saw through seeric vision.<\/p>     <p>The ancient seer saw those who would be raised up as latter-day witnesses to the truthfulness of this other scriptural record. Isaiah saw that it would come forth in a day of apostasy, as part of the great restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ in its fulness. He even saw an anecdotal event that would involve the future translator of the sacred record, one of the witnesses to the book's divine authenticity, and several of the learned of the world.<\/p>     <p>It is ironic that the learned of the world today have little understanding of the significance or meaning of this inspired chapter of Isaiah's ancient prophecies. In the words of the apostle Paul, they are \"ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.\" (<a class=\"ref\">2 Timothy 3:7<\/a>.) The wisdom of the wise of the world is limited because they lack an understanding of, or acceptance of, latter-day prophets, revelation, and scripture. Yet all of these are necessary to hold the key to unlocking the meaning of this great vision of the ancient seer, the prophet Isaiah.<\/p>",
