When the Lord, by his Spirit, made the world, none directed his Spirit, or gave advice what to do, or how to do it. The nations, in comparison of him, are as a drop which remains in the bucket, compared with the vast ocean; or as the small dust in the balance, which does not turn it, compared with all the earth. This magnifies God's love to the world, that, though it is of such small account and value with him, yet, for the redemption of it, he gave his only-begotten Son, <a class=\"ref\">John 3:16<\/a>. The services of the church can make no addition to him. Our souls must have perished for ever, if the only Son of the Father had not given himself for us.\n<\/p> ",
