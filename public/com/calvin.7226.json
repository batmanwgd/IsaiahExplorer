    "html": "<p><i> The city of<\/i><i> vanity is broken down.<\/i> I do not object to viewing this as relating especially to the desolation of Jerusalem. Yet it may be gathered from the context that it applies also to other cities; for shortly afterwards he uses the plural number in summoning the nations to appear before the same tribunal. But as the Prophet had his own countrymen chiefly in view, we may properly consider it to denote Jerusalem, which he calls \u201cthe city of vanity,\u201d either because there was no solid virtue in it, or because it was destroyed.<\/p> \n<p>The word<span class=\"greek-hebrew\"> \u05ea\u05d4\u05d5<\/span> (<i> t\u014dh\u016b<\/i>) may refer either to the destruction itself, or to their crimes, by which they provoked the wrath of God against them. If it be thought better to refer it to their crimes, it will denote \u201cthe city of confusion,\u201d in which nothing is regular or properly arranged; and I approve of this interpretation. Yet it may refer to the punishment; for it declares, in my opinion, the cause of the destruction, and gives up the city to ruin, because justice and good government are banished from it.<\/p> \n<p><i> Every house is shut up.<\/i> This is a proof of solitude, and the only reason why it is added is, to express the desolation of that city.<\/p> ",
