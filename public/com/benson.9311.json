Your great hopes and designs, O ye Assyrians, shall be utterly disappointed.<i> Your breath, as fire, shall devour you<\/i> \u2014 Your rage against my people shall bring ruin upon yourselves. Or, the arrogance, pride, wrath, and blasphemies which you vent against God shall be your destruction. Dr. Waterland renders the clause, \u201cYour breath shall be the fire that shall consume you.\u201d<i> The people shall be as the burnings of lime<\/i> \u2014 Shall be perfectly consumed, as when chalk-stones are reduced to lime; calcining, or reducing to ashes, being one of the last effects of fire. Thus we learn from this period, that when the calamity of the people, as well as the insolence of their enemies, should be come to the height, God would delay no longer, but immediately interpose and severely punish the oppressors, and thereby exalt his glory before the eyes of the nations, whom he calls upon, in the next words, to consider his doings.<i> Hear, ye afar off,<\/i> &c. \u2014 So remarkable a judgment as this deserves to be known, and laid to heart, by all men, both far and near.<\/p> ",
