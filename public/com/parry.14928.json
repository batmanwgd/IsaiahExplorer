Hence, those in Babylon who are cut off will be excommunicated from God and his saints, and they will not have any part of God's covenants. The reference to <i>son<\/i> and <i>nephew<\/i> here indicates that the line of inheritance will be cut off to make room for the new King Messiah to reign.<\/p> <p><i>saith the Lord.<\/i> Jehovah is the origin and authority of the revelation.<\/p> ",
