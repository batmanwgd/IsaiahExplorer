Verse 9 is a significant verse, as it speaks of the sureness of the Lord's covenant and also confirms the historicity of the biblical flood. The quotation of this verse in <a class=\"ref\">3 Ne. 22<\/a> adds another witness to three other Book of Mormon references (<a class=\"ref\">Alma 10:22; Ether 6:7; 13:2<\/a>) which also verify that the biblical flood occurred. Verse 10 speaks of the restoration of the earth to the condition in which it existed before it was cursed, as explained by President Joseph Fielding Smith (see DS, 2:316-17). The Book of Mormon retains the word \"people\" instead of \"peace\" in the same verse.<\/p>     ",
