    "html": " <p> <em>And of whom hast thou been afraid <\/em>&mdash;The sense of this verse is exceedingly obscure. The design is evidently to reprove the Jews for the course which they had been pursuing in practicing idolatry, and in seeking the alliance of foreign powers. The main scope of the passage seems to be, to state that all this was proof that they did not fear God. Their conduct did not originate from any reverence for him, or any respect to his commands. And the question, &lsquo;of whom hast thou been afraid?&rsquo; seems to mean that they had not been afraid of God. If they had had any reverence for any being or object that had led to the course which they had pursued, it was not for God. <\/p> <p> <em>That thou hast lied <\/em>&mdash;That thou hast been false and unfaithful to God. The image is here kept up of unfaithfulness to the marriage vow <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODc3MiI6M30=\">Isaiah 57:6-8<\/a>. <\/p> <p> <em>And hast not remembered me <\/em>&mdash;The proof of this was, that they had fallen into idolatry, and had sought the alliance and friendship of foreign powers. <\/p> <p> <em>Have not I held my peace <\/em>&mdash;The idea here seems to be, that God had been silent a long time, and they had, therefore, been emboldened to sin. He had, as it were, connived at their apostasy and infidelity; and they had thus cast off the fear of him, and given themselves wholly to idolatry.
