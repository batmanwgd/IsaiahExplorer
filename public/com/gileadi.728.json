As the ascent of righteous individuals such as Jehovah&rsquo;s seraphs-servants directly impacts the ascent of a new nation of Jehovah&rsquo;s people to exalted spiritual categories, so the parallel ascent of the earth to a paradisiacal glory leads to its positioning in a new or higher heavens. The state of joy that characterizes this development so transforms its participants that it permeates their whole existence.<\/p> ",
