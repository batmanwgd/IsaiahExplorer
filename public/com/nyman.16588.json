    "html": "          <p>Because Christ fulfilled his mission, he was to ascend into heaven and reign in glory with the Father. There he would disperse mercy to those who would accept him, repent, and live the gospel. He would be able to do this for three reasons: (1) he <i>gave<\/i> up his life and <i>overcame<\/i> death; (2) he was \"numbered with the transgressors\" (he knows what it is like to suffer pain and affliction); and (3) he atoned for the sins of the transgressors.<\/p>     <p>According to <a class=\"ref\">Mark 15:28<\/a>, Christ's being \"numbered with the transgressors\" was fulfilled when he was lifted up on the cross between two thieves. This interpretation is borne out by the Lord's statement in the Garden of Gethsemane, just prior to his arrest, that he had yet to fulfill this prophecy (see <a class=\"ref\">Luke 22:37<\/a>). However, <a class=\"ref\">Alma 7:11<\/a> shows that Christ's sufferings included even more than his trials and crucifixion.<\/p>     ",
