Because Jehovah has already &ldquo;redeemed&rdquo; them&mdash;in this case by the parallel idea of his taking their &ldquo;offenses&rdquo; and &ldquo;sins&rdquo; upon himself (cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODUzMV0seyIxODcxNiI6N30seyIxODg3NCI6M31d\">Isaiah 43:25; 53:4-10; 63:7-9<\/a>)&mdash;they have only to &ldquo;repent&rdquo; and &ldquo;return&rdquo; (<em>swb<\/em>) and he will accept them as his covenant people. As they do so, Jehovah will &ldquo;create&rdquo; or re-create them and they will be his &ldquo;servant&rdquo; or vassal in very deed (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDYwXQ==\">Isaiah 41:8<\/a> <strong>- <\/strong> 9; 43:1-4; 65:18). <\/p> ",
