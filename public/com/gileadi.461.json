Nevertheless, Jehovah&rsquo;s unweariness is attainable for his righteous people. A chiastic pattern parallels Jehovah&rsquo;s unweariness with the unweariness of those who &ldquo;ascend&rdquo;: Jehovah&rsquo;s unweariness (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDQ5XQ==\">v 28<\/a>)&mdash; <strong>a <\/strong> 1; people&rsquo;s weariness (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDUwXQ==\">v 29<\/a>)&mdash; <strong>b <\/strong> 1; youths&rsquo; weariness (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDUxXQ==\">v 30<\/a>)&mdash; <strong>b <\/strong> 2; the unweariness of those who ascend (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDUyXQ==\">v 31<\/a>)&mdash; <strong>a <\/strong> 2.
