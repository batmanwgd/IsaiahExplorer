    "html": "<p>Jehovah&rsquo;s deliverance of his people in the days of Hezekiah forms a classic model of the Davidic Covenant in action. All aspects of the covenant are operative: Jehovah protects his people &ldquo;for my own sake&rdquo; because he established his covenant with King David and his heirs (<a class=\"ref\">Psalm 89:3-4; Jeremiah 33:19-26<\/a>); and he protects them &ldquo;for the sake of my servant David&rdquo; because Hezekiah, David&rsquo;s heir and his people&rsquo;s proxy savior, intercedes with Jehovah on their behalf (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODM3MCI6NH0=\">vv 17-20<\/a>). In an end-time context, a literal &ldquo;servant&rdquo; or vassal named David fulfills that role (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODc0NCI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 55:3-4<\/a> ;<a class=\"ref\">Ezekiel 34:23-31; 37:21-27<\/a>).<\/p> ",
