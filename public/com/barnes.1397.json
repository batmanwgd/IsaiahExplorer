This invasion is represented as coming upon them as a judgment for their sins. When the Assyrian should be overthrown, it would be a proof that the sin which had been the cause of the invasion had been forgiven, and that God was now disposed to show them favor and mercy. It is common in the Scriptures to represent any calamity as the consequence of sin, to identify the removal of the calamity and the forgiveness of the sin. Thus, the Saviour said <a class=\"ref\">Mark 2:5 <\/a> to the man afflicted with the palsy, &lsquo;Son, thy sins be forgiven thee.&rsquo; And when the scribes complained, he urged that the power of forgiving sins and of healing disease was the same, or that the forgiveness of sin was equivalent to the removal of disease <a class=\"ref\">Mark 2:9 <\/a>. <\/p> ",
