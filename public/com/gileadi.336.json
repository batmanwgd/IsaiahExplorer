Although they are religious, praying and giving lip service to Jehovah, their piety is superficial. Grounded in human teachings or precepts of men, their religion separates them from him instead bringing them into his presence. When Jehovah intervenes among them at the onset of his Day of Judgment, what their &ldquo;sages&rdquo; and &ldquo;wise men&rdquo; knew or thought they knew&mdash;what their scholars and professors had taught them&mdash;Jehovah wonderfully overturns (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NTU5LDE4NzEyXQ==\">Isaiah 44:25; 52:15<\/a>).<\/p>",
