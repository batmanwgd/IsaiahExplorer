    "html": "<p><em>In righteousness shalt thou be established<\/em>&mdash;This is language which is appropriately addressed to a city or commonwealth. The idea is, that it would not be built up by fraud, and rapine, and conquest, as many cities had been, but by the prevalence of justice.<\/p><p><em>Thou shalt be far from oppressions<\/em>&mdash;That is, thou shalt be far from being oppressed by others. So the connection demands. The Hebrew would bear an active signification, so that it might be read, &lsquo;be thou far from oppression,&rsquo; that is, be far from oppressing others. But the design of the prophet is rather to promise than to command; and the idea is, that they should have no occasion to fear the violence of others anymore.<\/p><p><em>For it shall not come near thee<\/em>&mdash;This doubtless refers to the security, perpetuity, and prosperity of the church under the Messiah.<\/p> ",
