Let thine arm be stretched out in our behalf; for it has done great things formerly in defence of the same cause, and we are sure it is neither shortened nor weakened. <i>Therefore the redeemed of the Lord shall return, <\/i>&c. \u2014 These words express the persuasion of the prophet, that as the Lord did these great things formerly, so he would certainly do the like again.
