    "html": " <i>virgin.<\/i> The term <i>virgin<\/i> describes both one who is physically untouched and one who is pure and undefiled by the world. Isaiah's wife was a virgin in the latter sense, and Mary, Jesus' mother, was a virgin in both senses. The Hebrew word <i>'al<\/i><sup>e<\/sup>mah (despite some arguments to the contrary) does indeed mean \"virgin.\" <\/p> <p>The Book of Mormon prophets have identified Mary as \"a virgin, and she was exceedingly fair and white\" (<a class=\"ref\">1 Ne. 11:13<\/a>) \"a virgin, most beautiful and fair above all other virgins\" (<a class=\"ref\">1 Ne. 11:15<\/a>) \"the virgin&hellip;the mother of the Son of God\" (<a class=\"ref\">1 Ne. 11:18<\/a>) and \"a virgin, a precious and chosen vessel\" (<a class=\"ref\">Alma 7:10<\/a>). <\/p> <p> <i>son.<\/i> The name or title <i>son<\/i> plays a prominent role in defining Jesus' divine mission and atoning sacrifice. Jesus is called \"Son\" (<a class=\"ref\">Moses 5:8<\/a>), \"Son Ahman\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 78:20<\/a>), \"son of Abraham\" (<a class=\"ref\">Matt. 1:1<\/a>), \"Son of David\" (<a class=\"ref\">Matt. 9:27<\/a>), \"Son of God\" (<a class=\"ref\">1 Ne. 10:17<\/a>), \"son of Joseph\" (<a class=\"ref\">Luke 3:23<\/a>), \"Son of Man\" (<a class=\"ref\">Moses 6:57<\/a>), \"son of Mary\" (<a class=\"ref\">Mark 6:3<\/a>), \"Son of Righteousness\" (<a class=\"ref\">3 Ne. 25:2<\/a>), \"Son of the Eternal Father\" (<a class=\"ref\">1 Ne. 11:21<\/a>), \"Son of the everlasting God\" (<a class=\"ref\">1 Ne. 11:32<\/a>), \"Son of the Highest\" (<a class=\"ref\">Luke 1:32<\/a>), \"Son of the living God\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 14:9<\/a>), and \"Son of the most high God\" (<a class=\"ref\">1 Ne. 11:6<\/a>). <\/p> <p><i>shall call his name Immanuel.<\/i> The Hebrew sentence structure makes it clear that the virgin names the child: \"the virgin shall&hellip;call his name Immanuel.\" The name <i>Immanuel,<\/i> which means \"God with us\" or \"God is with us,\" indicates that God's love, power, knowledge, grace, and presence are with the righteous. Also, the name indicates that God himself came down from heaven and took upon himself mortality. For these and other reasons, Immanuel is Jesus, the son of David, who is called \"King Immanuel\" in a modern revelation (D&amp;C 128:22). The names <i>Immanuel<\/i> (\"God is with us\"), <i>Maher-shalal-hash-baz<\/i> (\"to speed, spoil, hasten, plunder\"), and <i>Jesus<\/i> (\"salvation\") are symbolic and have prophetic connotations.<\/p> ",
