    "html": " <p>A great reversal of circumstances between the righteous and the wicked transforms both in Jehovah&rsquo;s Day of Judgment. Even as the wicked perish, his elect participate in a new exodus to Zion: &ldquo;I will bring your offspring from the east and gather you from the west; I will say to the north, &lsquo;Give up!&rsquo; to the south, &lsquo;Withhold not! Bring my sons from afar and my daughters from the end of the earth&mdash;all who are called by my name, whom I have formed, molded and wrought for my own glory&rsquo;&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODUxMSI6M30=\">Isaiah 43:5-7<\/a>); &ldquo;Many peoples shall go, saying, &lsquo;Come, let us go up to the mountain of Jehovah&rsquo;&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3Njg5XQ==\">Isaiah 2:3<\/a>); <\/p> <p>&ldquo;I will lift up my hand to the nations, raise my ensign to the peoples; and they will bring your sons in their bosoms and carry your daughters on their shoulders&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NjU5XQ==\">Isaiah 49:22<\/a>); &ldquo;Nations will come to your light, their kings to the brightness of your dawn. Lift up your eyes and look about you! They have all assembled to come to you: your sons shall arrive from afar; your daughters shall return to your side&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODgyNSI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 60:3-4<\/a>). A joy-filled occasion for Jehovah&rsquo;s elect, the new exodus resembles Israel&rsquo;s ancient pilgrimage to Jerusalem to pay homage to Jehovah, the <em>Rock <\/em> of their salvation (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTM1LDE4MTY1XQ==\">Isaiah 26:4; 27:13<\/a>). <\/p> ",
