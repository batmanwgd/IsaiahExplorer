Those who are rotten will not partake of the Atonement and abide in Christ (<a class=\"ref\">John 15<\/a>), for if we abide in Christ we will bring forth good fruit. Those who are rotten will be trodden down by the Lord in great fury at the time of his second coming, causing his robe to be red (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 133:50-51<\/a>). <\/p> ",
