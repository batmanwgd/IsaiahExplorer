As in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NjQxXQ==\">Isaiah 49:4<\/a>, the speaker is the Servant of Jehovah, not Isaiah, though we may legitimately trace in what follows some echoes of the prophet\u2019s own experience. The union of the two names Adonai Jahveh (or Jehovah) indicates, as elsewhere, a special solemnity. <\/p>\n <p>The tongue of the learned.\u2014Better, of a disciple, or, well-trained scholar. <\/p>\n <p>That I should know how to speak.\u2014Better, that I should know how to sustain (or, refresh) the weary with a word. <\/p>\n <p>He wakeneth.\u2014The daily teaching of the morning communion with God is contrasted by implication with the dreams and night visions of a less perfect inspiration.
