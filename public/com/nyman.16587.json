    "html": "          <p>\"It pleased the Lord to bruise him\" is a declaration that Christ's sacrifice was a freewill offering, on <i>the<\/i> part of both the Father and the Son. In <a class=\"ref\">John 3:16-17<\/a>, Jesus declared that the Father had sent his Son to be sacrificed because of his love for the world. In <a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 34:3<\/a>, Jesus declared that he voluntarily gave his life because of his own love for the world.<\/p>     <p>The phrase \"make his soul an offering for sin\" was paraphrased by the Savior <i>when<\/i> he said to his ancient apostles that the Son of Man had come to minister and to \"give his life a ransom for many\" (<a class=\"ref\">Matt. 20:28<\/a>).<\/p>     <p>Who are the \"seed\" Christ was to see? Abinadi said that those who hearken to the words of the prophets and believe in Christ are his seed (see Mosiah <i>15:10-13).<\/i> His seed consists of those who are \"spiritually begotten\" as his sons and daughters (see <a class=\"ref\">Mosiah 5:7<\/a>; see also <i>The Promised<\/i> Messiah, pp. 359-62).<\/p>     <p><a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODcyMiI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 53:10-11<\/a> also provides a possible insight into the Savior's atonement. <i>The<\/i> passage may be suggesting that, when Christ was in the Garden of <i>Gethsemane,<\/i> he in some way placed himself in the stead of the inhabitants of the world and suffered the agony required to pay the demands of justice for their sins (see also <a class=\"ref\">Alma 7:13; 2 Ne. 9:20-23<\/a>). This extreme agony caused him <i>to<\/i> bleed <i>at every<\/i> pore (see <a class=\"ref\">Luke 22:44; Mosiah 3:7; D&amp;C 19:18<\/a>).<\/p>     ",
