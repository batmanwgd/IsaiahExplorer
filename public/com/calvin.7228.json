The ornament and perfection of cities consists of men; and therefore, when their inhabitants have been removed, cities are said to be deserted. The Prophet says ironically, that \u201cruin\u201d will be left; but the word <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05e9\u05de\u05d4 <\/span>,(<i>sh\u0103mm\u0103h <\/i>) is rendered by others <i>desolation <\/i>,, which amounts to the same thing. <\/p>,\n <p> <i>And the gate is smitten with desolation. <\/i>,He mentions the <i>gates <\/i>,, because in them the crowded population of the city was seen, for there the people assembled, and there the courts of justice were held. At first, therefore, he mentions the whole city, and next he names one part of it, but for the purpose of setting the matter in a stronger light; for although cities be deprived of their inhabitants, yet some are to be seen in the gates; but if the gates be altogether empty, there must be grievous solitude in the whole city. <\/p>,",
