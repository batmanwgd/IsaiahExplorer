    "html": " <i>people shall take them&hellip;to their place.<\/i> The Gentiles will help members of the house of Israel return to their lands of promise (<a class=\"ref\">1 Ne. 22:6-8; 2 Ne. 10:9<\/a>). <\/p> <p><i>from far unto the ends of the earth.<\/i> Inasmuch as the members of the house of Israel have been scattered throughout the centuries to every nation and country of the world (11:12), they will gather from the <i>ends of the earth<\/i> to their lands of promise.<\/p> <p><i>they shall return to their<\/i> <i>lands of promise<\/i>. America and the Holy Land are Israel's lands of promise and are prepared by God (<a class=\"ref\">1 Ne. 2:20; Ether 13:2<\/a>). Each of the two promised lands is \"the place for the city of Zion\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 57:2<\/a>), a place for the temple of the Lord (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 124:38<\/a>), a place of refuge against the forces of the world (<a class=\"ref\">2 Ne. 1:3-5<\/a>), and each stands as an antithesis to the place of \"bondage and captivity\" (<a class=\"ref\">Alma 36:28<\/a>). Symbolically, these lands are a type and shadow of heaven, which is \"a far better land of promise\" (<a class=\"ref\">Alma 37:45<\/a>). If the inhabitants of the land are wicked, they will be swept off (<a class=\"ref\">Ether 2:8-9<\/a>), an occurrence that is well attested in history for both lands of promise.<\/p> <p><i>land of the Lord.<\/i> The lands of promise belong to the Lord.<\/p> <p><i>take them captives unto whom they were captives.<\/i> Those who oppressed members of the house of Israel will become their captives. The verse should not be taken literally; instead it likely signifies that the house of Israel will be eternal rulers in God's kingdom.<\/p> ",
