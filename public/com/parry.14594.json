    "html": " <p><i>The Lord through the prophet Isaiah lists the iniquities of ancient Israel, which include rebelliousness, the commission of social injustices, and the neglect of true temple worship (1:2-15). The Lord then invites Israel to repent and cleanse herself through the power of the Atonement (1:16-20). In our own day the Lord has spoken through the Prophet Joseph Smith and detailed our transgressions, which include social injustices: we \"do not impart of [our] substance, as becometh saints, to the poor and afflicted\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 105:3<\/a>) further there are \"contentions, and envyings, and strifes, and lustful and covetous desires\" among us (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 101:6; 105<\/a>). We, like our brothers and sisters of ancient Israel, are invited to repent and become clean through Christ's divine sacrifice: \"though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow\" (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NjczXQ==\">1:18<\/a>).<\/i><\/p> <p><i> <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzY3OSI6OH0=\">Isa. 1:24-31<\/a> also has direct relevance for us today, for this section speaks of latter-day Zion (that is, us, the latter-day Church), who will be restored, redeemed, and cleansed. Our \"dross\" and \"tin\" will be removed; our righteous judges and counselors will be restored.<\/i><\/p> <p><i><\/i><\/p> ",
