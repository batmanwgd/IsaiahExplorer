The naming of Cyrus in this passage has led almost all biblical scholars to reject Isaiah as the author, because Cyrus lived approximately two hundred years after Isaiah. Influenced by the humanistic thinking of the times, they do not comprehend that a prophet can foretell the name and specific activities of a man so far in the future. This is no problem to the believer in the Book of Mormon. Joseph, who was sold into Egypt, prophesied of Moses by name more than two hundred years before he delivered Israel out of Egypt. He further prophesied of a choice seer in the latter days who would be called after his own name-Joseph-and he said that his father's name would be the same (see <a class=\"ref\">2 Ne. 3<\/a>) this prophecy was fulfilled approximately thirty-five hundred years later. As Isaiah testified, the Lord knows the end from the beginning (see <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NTk3XQ==\">Isaiah 46:10<\/a>), so he certainly could reveal the name of a person and identify the man's activities to his prophets as he saw fit. The actual prophecy about Cyrus delivering the Jews will be treated in the next chapter.     ",
