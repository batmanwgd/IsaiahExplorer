    "html": "<p><b>(<a class=\"ref\">2 Nephi 8:8<\/a>).<\/b>\"<i>The moth shall eat them up.<\/i>\" The moth was frequently used as a symbol of destruction. (See commentary on <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NjcyXQ==\">Isaiah 50:9<\/a>.) Those who ridicule the Lord's people shall ultimately be destroyed in the flesh, but His righteousness and salvation will be never ending. This utterance of Isaiah is reminiscent of a statement by President George Albert Smith, seventh prophet in these latter days: \"There have been some who have belittled [Joseph Smith], but I would like to say that those who have done so will be forgotten and their remains will go back to mother earth, \u2026 and the odor of their infamy will never die, while the glory and honor and majesty and courage and fidelity manifested by the Prophet Joseph Smith will attach to his name forever.\" (MOK, 80-81.)<\/p>",
