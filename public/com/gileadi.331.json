For all who pertain to Isaiah&rsquo;s Babylon category, Assyria&rsquo;s invasion ends in destruction as it did in the past ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc4NzkiOjd9LHsiMTgwMzciOjJ9XQ==\">Isaiah 10:28-34; 21:1-2<\/a>). Even the Zion\/Jerusalem category undergoes Assyria&rsquo;s siege until Jehovah has fully proven his people&rsquo;s loyalty ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc2NjIiOjJ9LHsiMTgyNTUiOjJ9XQ==\">Isaiah 1:7-8; 31:4-5<\/a>). The history of Jehovah&rsquo;s ancient people and their demise are told for the benefit of his end-time people. The<em>voice<\/em> designates Jehovah&rsquo;s servant, a seer ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTgxLDE4NjczXQ==\">Isaiah 28:16; 50:10<\/a>) who tells their tale.<\/p> ",
