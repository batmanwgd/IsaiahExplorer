And this invitation was the more necessary, because God foresaw that a great number of the Jews would, upon worldly considerations, continue in those foreign countries in which they were settled, and would be very backward to return to the Holy Land. <i>Touch no unclean thing <\/i>\u2014 Carry not along with you any of their superstitions or idolatries. <i>Be ye clean, that bear the vessels of the Lord <\/i>\u2014 And especially you priests and Levites, who minister in holy things, and carry the holy vessels of the temple, keep yourselves from all pollution. <i>Ye shall not go out by flight <\/i>\u2014 But securely, and in triumph, being conducted by your great captain, the Lord of hosts. <i>The God of Israel will be your rereward <\/i>\u2014 So that none shall be able either to oppose you in your march, or to fall upon you in the rear.<\/p>",
