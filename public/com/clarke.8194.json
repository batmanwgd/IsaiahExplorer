I add to this excellent remark, that the Chaldee manifestly reads <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05e8\u05e2\u05d5 <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, reo<\/span>, his neighbor, not <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d6\u05e8\u05e2\u05d5 <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, zeroo<\/span>, his arm; for he renders it by <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05e7\u05e8\u05d9\u05d1\u05d9\u05d4 <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, karibeyh<\/span>, his neighbor. And Jeremiah has the very same expression: <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d9\u05d0\u05db\u05dc\u05d5 \u05e8\u05e2\u05d4\u05d5 \u05d1\u05e9\u05e8 \u05d5\u05d0\u05d9\u05e9 <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, veish besar reehu yochelu<\/span>, \"and every one shall eat the flesh of his neighbor,\" <a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 19:9<\/a>. This observation, I think, gives the true reading and sense of this place: and the context strongly confirms it by explaining the general idea by particular instances, in the following verse: \"Every man shall devour the flesh of his neighbor;\" that is, they shall harass and destroy one another. \"Manasseh shall destroy Ephraim, and Ephraim, Manasseh;\" which two tribes were most closely connected both in blood and situation as brothers and neighbors; \"and both of them in the midst of their own dissensions shall agree in preying upon Judah.\" The common reading, \"shall devour the flesh of his own arm,\" in connection with what follows, seems to make either an inconsistency, or an anticlimax; whereas by this correction the following verse becomes an elegant illustration of the foregoing.\u2014L. <\/p>",
