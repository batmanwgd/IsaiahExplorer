Isaiah is concerned with all aspects of Jehovah&rsquo;s covenant people, even far into the future, while Hezekiah sees only the situation immediately at hand. He even calls Isaiah&rsquo;s dire prediction &ldquo;good,&rdquo; implying that he and his people have passed Jehovah&rsquo;s test of loyalty and others must answer for themselves. He has met his responsibility as king, establishing &ldquo;peace&rdquo; and &ldquo;loyalty&rdquo; in the land (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc4MzQiOjR9XQ==\">Isaiah 9:4-7<\/a>), while the cause of Judah&rsquo;s exile rests with future generations.<\/p>",
