    "html": " <p>(16) And upon all the ships of Tarshish.\u2014The words point to the commerce in the Red Sea carried on by the fleets of Uzziah and Jotham (<a class=\"ref\">1 Kings 22:48<\/a>); perhaps also to that in the Mediterranean with Tarshish, or Tartessus (Spain), as in <a class=\"ref\">Jonah 1:3<\/a>. The \u201cships of Tarshish\u201d had come to be used generically for all ships of the class used in such commerce, whether crossing the Mediterranean to Spain, or circumnavigating Africa, or passing over the Persian Gulf to Ophir. <\/p>\n <p>Upon all pleasant pictures.\u2014Literally, upon all imagery of delight (Comp. <a class=\"ref\">Leviticus 26:1; Numbers 33:52<\/a>.) The combination of the phrase with \u201cthe ships of Tarshish\u201d suggests the inference that it includes the works of art which were brought by them from East and West. For these, it would seem, there was a mania among the higher classes in Jerusalem, like that which in later times has fastened upon china, or pictures, or carvings in ivory. So the ships of Solomon brought gold and silver, and \u201civory and apes and peacocks\u201d (<a class=\"ref\">1 Kings 10:22<\/a>). The \u201civory beds\u201d of <a class=\"ref\">Amos 6:4<\/a>, the \u201cgold rings set with the beryl,\u201d the \u201civory overlaid with sapphires,\u201d the \u201cpillars of marble set upon sockets of fine gold\u201d of <a class=\"ref\">Song of Solomon 5:14-15<\/a>, the precious things in the treasury of Hezekiah (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDE1XQ==\">Isaiah 39:2<\/a>), may be taken as examples of this form of luxury. The \u00e6stheticism of the Roman Empire, of the Renaissance of the fifteenth century, of the age of Louis XIV., of our own time and country, presents obvious parallels. <\/p>",
