Here is,  I. A just reproof to those who, in that distress, trusted to the  Egyptians for help, and were all in a hurry to fetch succours from Egypt,   <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 30:1-7<\/a>.  II. A terrible threatening against those who slighted the good advice  which God by his prophets gave them for the repose of their minds in  that distress, assuring them that whatever became of others the  judgment would certainly overtake them,   <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 30:8-17<\/a>.  III. A gracious promise to those who trusted in God, that they should  not only see through the trouble, but should see happy days after it,  times of joy and reformation, plenty of the means of grace, and  therewith plenty of outward good things and increasing joys and  triumphs  (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 30:18-26<\/a>),  and many of these promises are very applicable to gospel grace.  IV. A prophecy of the total rout and ruin of the Assyrian army, which  should be an occasion of great joy and an introduction to those happy  times,   <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 30:27-33<\/a>.<\/p>",
