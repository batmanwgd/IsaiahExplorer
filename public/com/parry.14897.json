    "html": " <i>stir up the Medes against them, which shall not regard silver and gold.<\/i> God used Assyria as a rod to destroy many ancient Near East peoples; now he uses the wickedness of the Medes to kill each other (the Medes were located in the mountainous region north and east of Babylon). God is in control of history at every stage, in every moment, and he knows the beginning from the end.<\/p> <p> Historically, the Medes, having formed an alliance with the Persians under Cyrus the Great's leadership, conquered the great Babylonian empire by damming the Euphrates River, marching through its riverbed, going under the city walls, and subsequently capturing Babylon. This event took place more than one hundred sixty years after Isaiah's prophecy. The phrase <i>shall not regard silver and gold<\/i> indicates that the Medes did not go into battle to obtain plunder (silver and gold); instead, their motivation was to kill, and gain power and control. Perhaps ancient Media points forward to all nations of the last days who have the same wicked designs.<\/p> ",
