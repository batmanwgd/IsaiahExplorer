    "html": "<p> The period of punishment has now lasted sufficiently long; it is time for Jehovah to bring forth the salvation of His people. <em> \u201cI have been silent eternally long, was still, restrained myself; like a travailing woman, I now breathe again, snort and snuff together.\u201d<\/em> The standpoint of these prophecies has the larger half of the captivity behind it. It has already lasted a long time, though only for several decades; but in the estimation of Jehovah, with His love to His people, this time of long-suffering towards their oppressors is already an \u201ceternity\u201d (see <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODc3NywxODc5OSwxODg0OF0seyIxODg4NSI6Mn0sWzE4ODkwXV0=\">Isaiah 57:11; Isaiah 58:12; Isaiah 61:4; Isaiah 63:18-19; Isaiah 64:4<\/a>, cf., <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODk2LDE4ODk3XQ==\">Isaiah 64:10, Isaiah 64:11<\/a>). He has kept silence, has still forcibly restrained Himself, just as Joseph is said to have done to prevent himself from breaking out into tears (<a class=\"ref\">Genesis 43:31<\/a>). Love impelled Him to redeem His people; but justice was still obliged to proceed with punishment. <\/p><p> Three real futures now take the place of imperfects regulated by \u05d4\u05d7\u05e9\u05c1\u05d9\u05ea\u05d9 . They are not to be understood as denoting the violent breathing and snorting of a hero, burning with rage and thirsting for battle (Knobel); nor is \u05d0\u05e9\u05bc\u05c1\u05dd to be derived from \u05e9\u05c1\u05de\u05dd , as Hitzig supposes, through a mistaken comparison of <a class=\"ref\">Ezekiel 36:3<\/a>, though the latter does not mean to lay waste, but to be waste (see Hitzig on <a class=\"ref\">Ezekiel 36:3<\/a>). The true derivation is from \u05e0\u05e9\u05c1\u05dd , related to \u05e0\u05e9\u05c1\u05e3 , \u05e0\u05e4\u05e9\u05c1 , \u05e0\u05e9\u05c1\u05d1 . To the figure of a hero there is now added that of a travailing woman; \u05e4\u05bc\u05e2\u05d4 is short breathing (with the glottis closed); \u05e0\u05e9\u05c1\u05dd the snorting of violent inspiration and expiration; \u05e9\u05c1\u05d0\u05e3 the earnest longing for deliverance pressing upon the burden in the womb; and \u05d9\u05d7\u05d3 expresses the combination of all these several strainings of the breath, which are associated with the so-called labour-pains. Some great thing, with which Jehovah has, as it were, long been pregnant, is now about to be born.<\/p>",
