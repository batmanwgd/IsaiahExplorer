In our fasting we are to do far more than simply abstain from two meals, nor are we to put on an appearance of one who is making a sacrifice. In a true fast we seek to help and bless others. We remove heavy burdens from the shoulders of others. We share our substance. If we do these things, we will be blessed spiritually and temporally. Our portion of light will increase. Our health will be strengthened. The Lord will be our guide in all things.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>The Lord speaks again of the Sabbath. He promises that if we will turn away from our own pleasures on the Sabbath and turn to the things that will delight the Lord, he will lift us up to spiritual richness and bestow on us all the blessings of Jacob.<\/i><\/p> ",
