That vision, Isaiah embedded in his book as a message for the end-time (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 30:8<\/a>). At fault are Jehovah&rsquo;s end-time people for not proclaiming or even understanding it (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 29:11<\/a>): &ldquo;Have I not made it known to you from of old? Did I not foretell it, you being my witnesses?&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 44:8<\/a>). Their failing to serve as Jehovah&rsquo;s witnesses places them among the blind and deaf (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 29:18; 42:18-20; 43:10, 12; 44:7-8<\/a>).<\/p>",
