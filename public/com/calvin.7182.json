    "html": "<p><i> And he took away the covering of Judah.<\/i> He shews in what distress of mind the Jews were when they were so closely besieged. Some refer this verb to God, and others to the enemy; but I rather think it ought to be taken indefinitely, for by a mode of expression frequently used in the Hebrew language, \u201che took away,\u201d means that \u201cthe covering of Judah was taken away.\u201d By the word<i> covering<\/i> almost all think that either the Temple or God himself is meant, in whose name the Jews falsely boasted. But I interpret it more simply as denoting the armory, in which, as a secret place, they kept the instruments of war. He calls it a \u201ccovering,\u201d because they were not exposed to public view, but were concealed in a more sacred place. In short, he describes what commonly happens in a season of great alarm, because at such a time men run to arms, and the instruments of war, which had been formerly concealed, are brought forward.<\/p> \n<p><i> And thou didst look in that day to the armory of the house of the forest.<\/i> This latter clause agrees with what has been remarked, that they sought out, on such an occasion, every place which contained the means of arming themselves for a case of extreme urgency, the instruments of war having lain long concealed during peace. Sacred history informs us, that this \u201chouse of the forest\u201d was built by Solomon, in order to contain the armory of the whole kingdom. (<a class=\"ref\">1 Kings 7:2<\/a> .) The change of person,<i> thou didst look<\/i> , does not obscure the meaning, but rather confirms what I have already remarked, that the Prophet relates how eagerly the Jews at that time made every preparation for defending the city.<\/p> ",
