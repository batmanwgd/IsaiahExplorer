    "html": " <p>Isaiah links the land&rsquo;s survivors inseparably to the son Immanuel through the common imagery of &ldquo;cream and honey&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzc5NyI6Mn0=\">vv 14-15<\/a>). Both comprise affiliates of Zion whom Jehovah saves alive through his direct intervention. Not under a covenant curse as are the wicked of his people, this group prepared for hard times by keeping alive a &ldquo;young cow&rdquo; or &ldquo;heifer&rdquo; (<em>&lsquo;eglat baqar<\/em>) and a pair of &ldquo;sheep&rdquo; or &ldquo;goats&rdquo; (<em>se&rsquo;on <\/em>). The word &ldquo;man&rdquo; that characterizes those who are left in the land indicates the individuality of those who survive&mdash;only a man here and a man there&mdash;not Jehovah&rsquo;s people as a whole. <\/p> ",
