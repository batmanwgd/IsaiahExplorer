Those who create or worship idols will be empty and as \"nothing\"\u2014without an eternal inheritance and without eternal increase. The gods \"in which they delight\" will not benefit (\"shall not profit\") them.<\/p> <p><i>they are their own witnesses.<\/i> As the followers of the Lord serve as his witnesses (see 44:8), so the makers of idols are derided as witnesses of their idols. The idol makers are not credible witnesses, however, because they are \"vanity,\" \"they see not, nor know\" the truth.<\/p> <p> <i>they may be ashamed. Ashamed<\/i> is used three times in 44:9 and 44:11. Shame is an awareness of a loss of honor and glory. Isaiah says that he who \"formed a god\" along with his worshiping companions (\"his fellows\") will \"be ashamed together,\" probably at the Day of Judgment.<\/p> ",
