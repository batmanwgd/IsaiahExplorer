    "html": "<p>Immediately after the prophecy of the destruction of Israel, Isaiah gave a prophecy concerning the destiny of Assyria lest anyone conclude that this heathen nation was righteous and noble because of its success against Israel and Judah. The fulfillment of this detailed prophecy has been historically confirmed. Isaiah mentioned some of the successful military campaigns of Assyria (see <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODM5XQ==\">v. 9<\/a>) and prophesied of the eventual intrusion and success against Judah, even listing the names of many of the cities of Judah that would fall to Assyria (see <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">vv. 28&ndash;32<\/a>). The destruction both of Israel and of Assyria is described as complete (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzg0NSI6NX0=\">vv. 15&ndash;19<\/a>). The destruction of Israel and Assyria is also a type of the destruction of the wicked in any age and has its prophesied parallel even for the latter days.<\/p><p class=\"cite\">LDS Church Educational System Old Testament Student Manual, 1 Kings&ndash;Malachi, Religion 302, Chapter 13, Item 56<\/p>",
