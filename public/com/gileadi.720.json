From innocent-seeming barbecues in the park to abhorrent satanic rituals, their degenerate performances simultaneously replicate and desecrate sacred ordinances. Ensnaring their devotees into regarding Jehovah&rsquo;s righteous people as religious oddities, their cult breeds a dismissive &ldquo;holier-than-thou&rdquo; attitude.
