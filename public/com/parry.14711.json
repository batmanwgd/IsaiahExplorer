    "html": " <i>anger&hellip;kindled.<\/i> This idiom, which likens God's anger to fire, is common in Joseph Smith's revelations. The Lord's anger is always directed toward \"the wicked and rebellious\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 63:2; 5:8<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\"> 82:6<\/a>). <\/p> <p> <i>stretched forth his hand against them.<\/i> This idiom means that God sends forth his power or his judgments against the wicked (<a class=\"ref\">Ezek. 6:14; 14:9<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\">Zeph. 1:4<\/a>). <\/p> <p><i>hills did tremble.<\/i> Both humanity and the earth's elements react to the great glory, majesty, and presence of God. A variety of scriptures explain: \"The Lord reigneth; let the people tremble\" (<a class=\"ref\">Ps. 99:1<\/a>) \"the nations may tremble at thy presence\" (64:2); and \"let all the inhabitants of the land tremble: for the day of the Lord cometh\" (<a class=\"ref\">Joel 2:1<\/a>). <\/p> <p><i>their carcasses were torn.<\/i> Perhaps this phrase describes a result of war.<\/p> <p><i>his hand is stretched out still.<\/i> This poetic refrain, located at 9:12, 17, 21; 10:4, may signify one of two very different things: Although God is angry with his people for their sin and rebellion, he still stretches out his hand in mercy to his children (for this interpretation, see <a class=\"ref\">2 Ne. 28:32<\/a>) or the Lord's hand is yet stretched out in delivering destruction to the people (for this interpretation, see <a class=\"ref\">Ezek. 6:14<\/a>). The translation of Today's English Version of the Bible in this instance supports the second interpretation: \"Yet even so the Lord's anger is not ended; his hand is still stretched out to punish,\" as does the Jerusalem Bible: \"Yet his anger is not spent, still his hand is raised to strike.\"<\/p> ",
