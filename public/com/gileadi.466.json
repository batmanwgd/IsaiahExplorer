    "html": "<p>Jehovah calls on the Jacob\/Israel category of his people to repent and return from exile. Like Abraham, their progenitor, who left kindreds and friends behind and came from the end of the earth to the Promised Land (<a class=\"ref\">Genesis 12:1<\/a>), they are now summoned to leave kindreds and friends and renew their covenant with Jehovah and become his collective &ldquo;servant&rdquo; or vassal. Jehovah assures them that although they may have felt abandoned by him on account of their idolatries (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODQ0OF0seyIxODUyOCI6M31d\">Isaiah 40:27; 43:22-24<\/a>), as they return to him he will again accept them as his covenant people (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg1MDciOjd9LHsiMTg2NDciOjd9XQ==\">Isaiah 43:1-7; 49:10-16<\/a>).<\/p><p>The mention of a person by name&mdash;as with &ldquo;Abraham my beloved friend&rdquo;&mdash;alludes to a precedent that person set. Abraham&rsquo;s coming from afar to the Promised Land, for example, became a type of his descendants&rsquo; doing so. If his people now pass this test of their faith as Abraham did, Jehovah will bless them as he blessed him. The alternative is to be destroyed in a Sodom-and-Gomorrah type of destruction (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODUwNCI6M30=\">Isaiah 42:23-25<\/a>). To be &ldquo;beloved&rdquo; of God, moreover, identifies the seraph category of Jehovah&rsquo;s people that includes his servant (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NjI5XQ==\">Isaiah 48:14<\/a>), who also comes from afar (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDU0LDE4NDc3LDE4NTk4XQ==\">vv 2, 25; 46:11<\/a>).<\/p>",
