    "html": "<p><b>(<a class=\"ref\">2 Nephi 19:6<\/a>).<\/b>\"<i>For unto us a child is born \u2026 and the government shall be upon his shoulder.<\/i>\" As noted in the chapter overview, various interpretations have been applied to the identity of the promised child, but the author's position is that it primarily refers to Christ. One of the better summaries of the various interpretations of this verse was given by Victor Ludlow:<\/p>     <p>\"If Isaiah is prophesying about Hezekiah [the young king of Judah who helped deliver the Israelites from the Assyrians], then verse 3 describes the Israelites' joy at their deliverance; verse 4 portrays how the Assyrians were defeated in spite of their greater numbers, just as the many Midianites were by Gideon and his 300 men (<a class=\"ref\">Judg. 7<\/a>); verse 5 describes the Assyrian casualties; and verses 6 and 7 tell us about Hezekiah's titles and righteous, peaceful rule as king.<\/p>     <p>\"If the verses describe a righteous people fighting against wickedness, then verse 3 describes their joy at success, verses 4 and 5 portray the defeat of the enemy, and verses 6 and 7 describe a new age of millennial peace that may be assisted or ushered in by a messianic figure.<\/p>     <p>\"Finally, the identification of the ruler in verses 3 7 with Jesus Christ has a number of possibilities, as verse 3 talks about his many followers who rejoice at the spiritual blessings he has provided; verse 4 describes how he was able to overcome the temptations of Satan, break the yoke of sin, and maintain power over the legions of Satan's devils; verse 5 symbolizes his atonement and the cleansing powers of baptism and the Holy Ghost; verse 6 presents some of his titles and roles; and verse 7 describes his eternal position as the Lord and King of this earth.\" (IPSP, 154.)<\/p>",
