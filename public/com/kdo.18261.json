    "html": "<p> The justice of God will not rest till it has procured for itself the fullest satisfaction. <em> \u201cBehold, it is written before me: I will not keep silence without having recompensed, and I will recompense into their bosom. Your offences, and the offences of your fathers together, saith Jehovah, that they have burned incense upon the mountains, and insulted me upon the hills, and I measure their reward first of all into their bosom.\u201d<\/em> Vitringa has been misled by such passages as <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODUyXQ==\">Isaiah 10:1<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\">Job 13:26; Jeremiah 22:30<\/a>, in which <em> ka\u0302thabh <\/em> (<em> kitte\u0304bh <\/em> ) is used to signify a written decree, and understands by <em> kh e thu\u0304bha\u0302h <\/em> the sentence pronounced by God; but the reference really is to their idolatrous conduct and contemptuous defiance of the laws of God. This is ever before Him, written in indelible characters, waiting for the day of vengeance; for, according to the figurative language of Scripture, there are heavenly books, in which the good and evil works of men are entered. And this agrees with what follows: \u201cI will not be silent, without having first repaid,\u201d etc. The accentuation very properly places the tone upon the penultimate of the first <em> shillamt\u0131\u0304 <\/em> as being a pure perfect, and upon the last syllable of the second as a <em> perf. consec.<\/em> \u05d0\u05dd \u05db\u05bc\u05d9 preceded by a future and followed by a perfect signifies, \u201cbut if (without having) first,\u201d etc. (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzUxLDk1NiwzMzc2LDcxOTFd\">Isaiah 55:10; Genesis 32:27; Leviticus 22:6; Ruth 3:18<\/a>; cf., <a class=\"ref\">Judges 15:7<\/a>). The original train of thought was, \u201cI will not keep silence, for I shall first of all keep silence when,\u201d etc. Instead of <em> \u201bal <\/em> <em> c he\u0304qa\u0302m <\/em> , \u201cUpon their bosom,\u201d we might have <em> 'el <\/em> <em> c he\u0304qa\u0302m <\/em> , into their bosom, as in <a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 32:18; Psalms 79:12<\/a>. In <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4OTA1XQ==\">Isaiah 65:7<\/a> the <em> keri<\/em> really has <em> 'el <\/em> instead of <em> \u201bal <\/em> , whilst in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4OTA3XQ==\">Isaiah 65:9<\/a> the <em> chethib<\/em> is <em> \u201bal <\/em> without any <em> keri<\/em> (for the figure itself, compare <a class=\"ref\">Luke 6:38<\/a>, \u201cinto your bosom\u201d). The thing to be repaid follows in  ; it is not governed, however, by <em> shillamt\u0131\u0304 <\/em> , as the form of the address clearly shows, but by <em> 'a\u0306shalle\u0304m <\/em> understood, which may easily be supplied. Whether <em> 'a\u0306sher <\/em> is to be taken in the sense of <em> qui <\/em> or <em> quod <\/em> (that), it is hardly possible to decide; but the construction of the sentence favours the latter. Sacrificing \u201cupon mountains and hills\u201d (and, what is omitted, here, \u201cunder every green tree\u201d) is the well-known standing phrase used to describe the idolatry of the times preceding the captivity (cf., <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzczLDIyMTQ3LDIwNTc3XQ==\">Isaiah 57:7; Hosea 4:13; Ezekiel 6:13<\/a>). \u05d5\u05bc\u05de\u05d3\u05bc\u05ea\u05d9 points back to <em> v e shillamt\u0131\u0304 <\/em> in  , after the object has been more precisely defined. Most of the modern expositors take \u05e8\u05d0\u05e9\u05c1\u05e0\u05d4 \u05e4\u05e2\u05dc\u05bc\u05ea\u05dd together, in the sense of \u201ctheir former wages,\u201d i.e., the recompense previously deserved by their fathers. But in this case the concluding clause would only affirm, by the side of  , that the sins of the fathers would be visited upon them. Moreover, this explanation has not only the accents against it, but also the parallel in <a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 16:18<\/a> (see Hitzig), which evidently stands in a reciprocal relation to the passage before us. Consequently <em> ri'sho\u0304na\u0302h <\/em> must be an adverb, and the meaning evidently is, that the first thing which Jehovah had to do by virtue of His holiness was to punish the sins of the apostate Israelites; and He would so punish them that inasmuch as the sins of the children were merely the continuation of the fathers' sins, the punishment would be measured out according to the desert of both together.<\/p>",
