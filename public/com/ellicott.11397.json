The culture which the psalm implies is what might have been expected from one whom Isaiah had trained, who had restored and organised the worship of the Temple (<a class=\"ref\">2 Chronicles 29:25-30<\/a>), who spoke to Levites and soldiers as a preacher (<a class=\"ref\">2 Chronicles 30:22; 2 Chronicles 32:6<\/a>), \u201cspeaking comfortably\u201d (literally, to their heart), and who had directed the compilation of a fresh set of the proverbs ascribed to Solomon (<a class=\"ref\">Proverbs 25:1<\/a>). It will be seen, as we go through the hymn, that it presents echoes of the Book of Job as well as of the earlier Psalms.<\/p>",
