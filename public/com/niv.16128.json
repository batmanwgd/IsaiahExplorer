As we saw throughout chapters 1\u20135, Isaiah keeps calling his hearers back from the beautiful promises of the future to the grimmer realities of the present. So here he is at pains to remind the Judeans that it is not Assyria with whom they must come to terms but the Holy One of Israel. Assyria will not determine Judah\u2019s final destiny, but Yahweh will; thus, they must look to their relationship with him.<\/p>     <p>\u2003The prophet addresses this first in 9:8\u201310:4, where he points out to the Judeans that their trouble is not because of Assyria\u2019s greatness but because God\u2019s hand of punishment is raised against them. This means that a day will come when Assyria\u2019s task is finished, and in that day, in view of Assyria\u2019s overbearing pride, God\u2019s hand will be raised against Assyria as well (10:5\u2013 34). With God\u2019s lordship of history established, the prophet then turns to a discussion of the events at the end of history, the messianic kingdom (11:1\u2013 16). This is followed by the beautiful two-part hymn of chapter 12, which closes the subdivision by praising God for his trustworthiness.<\/p>     <p>\u2003Isaiah 9:8\u201310:4 has four stanzas, each of which closes with the refrain already encountered in 5:25: \u201cYet for all this, his anger is not turned away, his hand is still upraised.\u201d It is not Assyria\u2019s anger but Yahweh\u2019s that must be dealt with. The four charges God lodges against Israel, as in chapter 1, all have to do with ethical behavior, with the covenant providing the background.<\/p>     <p>\u2003The first charge (9:8\u201312) is arrogance; instead of humble submission to their covenant Lord, the Israelites attempt to exalt themselves. The result, as in 2:6\u20134:1, will be humiliation. The second charge (9:13\u201317) is adulation of great men instead of turning back to the Lord. Thus, the whole nation will suffer. The third charge (9:18\u201321) is the lack of brotherly love. Having forsaken their covenant Lord, the various tribes attack each other in a bloodbath reminiscent of the final three chapters in the book of Judges. The final charge (10:1\u20134) describes the social injustice that is inescapable in a society where everyone is looking out for himself or herself alone.<\/p>     <p>\u2003These are the reasons the Assyrians are coming. Change these, and history itself will change. But fail to address these, and even if there might no longer be an Assyria on the scene, God will use another punishment to deal with his people.<\/p>     ",
