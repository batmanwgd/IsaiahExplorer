    "html": "<p><i>From Jehovah of hosts shalt thou be visited. <\/i> He next assigns the reason why all this multitude of garrisons shall be \u201clike chaff;\u201d and he expresses this by an opposite metaphor, for with those soldiers he contrasts the anger and \u201cvisitation of the Lord.\u201d What is \u201cchaff\u201d to the flame of \u201ca devouring fire?\u201d What is \u201cdust\u201d to the force and violence of a \u201cwhirlwind?\u201d He shews that the vengeance of God will be such as all their preparations shall be unable to resist. This meaning, in my opinion, makes the passage to flow easily, and the clauses will not be so well adjusted, if we follow a different interpretation.<\/p> \n<p>Hence we learn that those who assail us can do no more than what the Lord permits them to do. If therefore the Lord determine to save us, the enemies will accomplish nothing, though they raise up the whole world against us. On the other hand, if he determine to chastise us, we shall not be able to ward off his wrath by any force or bulwarks, which shall quickly be thrown down as by a \u201cwhirlwind,\u201d and shall even be consumed as by \u201ca flame.\u201d<\/p> ",
