The converse also is true: When we do not seek him, we do not find him.<\/p> <p><i>I said unto my servant&hellip;I will send you.<\/i> The Lord here calls a servant to go to a nation that is not joined to him by covenant. That servant could be Isaiah, Jesus Christ, Joseph Smith, or another prophet\u2014or the prophecy could apply to any others who fit that circumstance.<\/p> <p><i>nation that is not called after my name.<\/i> We are called by Christ's name when we have joined his family through the baptism of water and of fire. Thus the prophet is called to warn people who do not know the Lord in their heart of hearts, though they may profess him with their lips.<\/p> ",
