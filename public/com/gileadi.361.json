    "html": " <p>A verse similar to <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODIwMSI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 29:7-8 <\/a>&mdash;in which &ldquo;the nations that amass to fight against Mount Zion&rdquo; come away empty&mdash;this depicts Jehovah&rsquo;s descent on the mount in a great display of power as he did anciently on Mount Sinai (cf. <a class=\"ref\">Exodus 19:16-20 <\/a>). When enemy herders or shepherds think to deal the death blow to Jehovah&rsquo;s people by destroying his elect, Jehovah descends to wage war upon them (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgyNDgiOjN9LHsiMTg4ODciOjN9XQ==\">Isaiah 30:30-32; 64:1-3 <\/a>). While many may be &ldquo;dismayed&rdquo; by the enemy&rsquo;s <em>voice <\/em>&mdash;the king of Assyria\/Babylon&mdash;or &ldquo;daunted&rdquo; by his formidable forces, none can withstand the divine power of Jehovah. <\/p> ",
