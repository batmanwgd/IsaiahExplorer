A piece of ground thus cleared of the stones Persius, in his hard way of metaphor, calls \" <i>exossatus ager<\/i>,\" an unboned field; Sat. 6:52. <\/p>\n\n <p> <em>The choicest vine \"Sorek\"\u2014<\/em>, Many of the ancient interpreters, the Septuagint, Aquila, and Theod., have retained this word as a proper name; I think very rightly. Sorek was a valley lying between Ascalon and Gaza, and running far up eastward in the tribe of Judah. Both Ascalon and Gaza were anciently famous for wine; the former is mentioned as such by Alexander Trallianus; the latter by several authors, quoted by Reland, Palaest., p. 589 and 986. And it seems that the upper part of the valley of Sorek, and that of Eshcol, where the spies gathered the single cluster of grapes, which they were obliged to bear between two upon a staff, being both near to Hebron were in the same neighborhood, and that all this part of the country abounded with rich vineyards. Compare <a class=\"ref\">Numbers 13:22, Numbers 13:23; Judges 16:3, Judges 16:4<\/a>. P. Nau supposes Eshcol and Sorek to be only different names for the same valley. Voyage Noveau de la Terre Sainte, lib. iv., chap. 18. See likewise De Lisle's posthumous map of the Holy Land. Paris, 1763. See Bochart, Hieroz. ii., Colossians 725. Thevenot, i, p. 406. Michaelis (note on <a class=\"ref\">Judges 16:4<\/a>; (note), German translation) thinks it probable, from some circumstances of the history there given, that Sorek was in the tribe of Judah, not in the country of the Philistines. <\/p>\n\n <p>The vine of Sorek was known to the Israelites, being mentioned by Moses, <a class=\"ref\">Genesis 49:11<\/a>, before their coming out of Egypt. Egypt was not a wine country. \"Throughout this country there are no wines;\" Sandys, p. 101. At least in very ancient times they had none. Herodotus, 2:77, says it had no vines and therefore used an artificial wine made of barley. That is not strictly true, for the vines of Egypt are spoken of in Scripture, <a class=\"ref\">Psalm 78:47; Psalm 105:33<\/a>; and see <a class=\"ref\">Genesis 40:11<\/a>, by which it should seem that they drank only the fresh juice pressed from the grape, which was called <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u03b1\u03bc\u03c0\u03b5\u03bb\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2<\/span>,; Herodot., 2:37. But they had no large vineyards, nor was the country proper for them, being little more than one large plain, annually overflowed by the Nile. The Mareotic in later times is, I think, the only celebrated Egyptian wine which we meet with in history. The vine was formerly, as Hasselquist tells us it is now, \"cultivated in Egypt for the sake of eating the grapes, not for wine, which is brought from Candia,\" etc. \"They were supplied with wine from Greece, and likewise from Phoenicia,\" Herodot., 3:6. The vine and the wine of Sorek therefore, which lay near at hand for importation into Egypt, must in all probability have been well known to the Israelites, when they sojourned there. There is something remarkable in the manner in which Moses, <a class=\"ref\">Genesis 49:11<\/a>, makes mention of it, which, for want of considering this matter, has not been attended to; it is in Jacob's prophecy of the future prosperity of the tribe of Judah:\u2014<\/p>\n\n <p>\"Binding his foal to the vine, <\/p>\n\n <p>And his ass's colt to his own sorek; <\/p>\n\n <p>He washeth his raiment in wine, <\/p>\n\n <p>And his cloak in the blood of grapes.\" <\/p>\n\n <p>I take the liberty of rendering <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05e9\u05e8\u05e7\u05d4 <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, sorekah<\/span>, for <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05e9\u05e8\u05e7\u05d5 <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, soreko<\/span>, his <span class=\"translit\">, sorek<\/span>, as the Masoretes do by pointing <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05e2\u05d9\u05e8\u05d4 <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, iroh<\/span>, for <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05e2\u05d9\u05e8\u05d5 <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, iro<\/span>, his foal. <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05e2\u05d9\u05e8 <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, ir<\/span>, might naturally enough appear in the feminine form; but it is not at all probable that <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05e9\u05e8\u05e7 <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, sorek<\/span>, ever should. By naming particularly the vine of Sorek, and as the vine belonging to Judah, the prophecy intimates the very part of the country which was to fall to the lot of that tribe. Sir John Chardin says, \"that at Casbin, a city of Persia, they turn their cattle into the vineyards after the vintage, to browse on the vines.\" He speaks also of vines in that country so large that he could hardly compass the trunks of them with his arms. Voyages, tom. iii., p. 12, 12mo. This shows that the ass might be securely bound to the vine, and without danger of damaging the tree by browsing on it. <\/p>\n\n <p> <em>And built a tower in the midst of it\u2014<\/em>, Our Savior, who has taken the general idea of one of his parables, <a class=\"ref\">Matthew 21:33; Mark 12:1<\/a>, from this of Isaiah, has likewise inserted this circumstance of building a tower; which is generally explained by commentators as designed for the keeper of the vineyard to watch and defend the fruits. But for this purpose it was usual to make a little temporary hut, (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NjYzXQ==\">Isaiah 1:8<\/a>;), which might serve for the short season while the fruit was ripening, and which was removed afterwards. The tower therefore should rather mean a building of a more permanent nature and use; the farm, as we may call it, of the vineyard, containing all the offices and implements, and the whole apparatus necessary for the culture of the vineyard, and the making of the wine. To which image in the allegory, the situation the manner of building, the use, and the whole service of the temple, exactly answered. And so the Chaldee paraphrast very rightly expounds it: <i>Et statui eos (Israelitas) ut plantam vineae selectae et aedificavi Sanctuarium meum in medio illorum<\/i>,. \"And I have appointed the Israelites as a plant of a chosen vine, and I have built my sanctuary in the midst of them.\" So also Hieron. in loc. <i>Aedificavit quoque turrim in medio ejus; templum videlicet in media civitate<\/i>,. \"He built also a tower in the midst of it, viz., his own temple in the midst of the city.\" That they have still such towers or buildings for use or pleasure, in their gardens in the East, see Harmer's Observations, 2 p. 241. <\/p>\n\n <p> <em>And also made a wine-press therein. \"And hewed out a lake therein\"\u2014<\/em>, This image also our Savior has preserved in his parable. <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d9\u05e7\u05d1 <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, yekeb<\/span>,; the Septuagint render it here <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd<\/span>, and in four other places <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u03c5\u0314\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd<\/span>, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3OTgwXQ==\">Isaiah 16:10<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\">Joel 3:13; Haggai 2:17; Zechariah 14:10<\/a>, I think more properly; and this latter word St. Mark uses. It means not the wine-press itself, or calcatorium, which is called <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d2\u05ea <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, gath<\/span>, or <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05e4\u05d5\u05e8\u05d4 <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, purah<\/span>,; but what the Romans called lacus, the lake; the large open place or vessel, which by a conduit or spout received the must from the wine-press. In very hot countries it was perhaps necessary, or at least very convenient, to have the lake under ground, or in a cave hewed out of the side of the rock, for coolness, that the heat might not cause too great a fermentation, and sour the must. <i>Vini confectio instituitur in cella, vel intimae domus camera quadam a ventorum ingressu remota<\/i>,. Kempfer, of Shiras wine. Amaen. Exot. p. 376. For the wind, to which that country is subject, would injure the wine. \"The wine-presses in Persia,\" says Sir John Chardin, \"are formed by making hollow places in the ground, lined with masons' work.\" Harmer's Observations, i., p. 392. See a print of one in Kempfer, p. 377. <\/p>\n\n <p>Nonnus describes at large Bacchus hollowing the inside of a rock, and hewing out a place for the wine-press, or rather the lake:\u2014<\/p>\n\n <p> <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u039a\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c3\u03ba\u03bf\u03c0\u03b5\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u03b5\u03bb\u03b1\u03c7\u03b7\u03bd\u03b5\u0387 \u03c0\u03b5\u03b4\u03bf\u03c3\u03ba\u03b1\u03c6\u03b5\u03bf\u03c2 \u03b4\u03b5 \u03c3\u03b9\u03b4\u03b7\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5\ufffd\ufffd <-144 \ufffd\u0398\u03b7\u03b3\u03b1\u03bb\u03b5\u03b7\u0345 \u03b3\u03bb\u03c9\u03c7\u03b9\u03bd\u03b9 \u03bc\u03c5\u03c7\u03bf\u03bd \u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf \u03c0\u03b5\u03c4\u03c1\u03b7\u03c2\u0387\ufffd\u039b\u03b5\u03b9\u03b7\u03bd\u03b1\u03c2 \u03b4\u03b5 \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03c9\u03c0\u03b1 \u03b2\u03b1\u03b8\u03c5\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd \u03ba\u03b5\u03bd\u03b5\u03c9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\ufffd\u0391\u03c6\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd<\/span>,[ <i>f<\/i>,. <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u03b1\u03ba\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd<\/span>,] <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u03b5\u03c5\u0344\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03c6\u03c5\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9\u03bf \u03c4\u03c5\u03c0\u03bf\u03bd \u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03b7\u03c3\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf \u03bb\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5. <\/span> <\/p>\n\n <p> <i>Dionysiac. lib. xii., 50:331. <\/i> <\/p> <i>\n\n <\/i> <p> <i><\/i>,\"He pierced the rock; and with the sharpen'd tool <\/p>\n\n <p>Of steel well-temper'd scoop'd its inmost depth: <\/p>\n\n <p>Then smooth'd the front, and form'd the dark recess <\/p>\n\n <p>In just dimensions for the foaming lake.\" <\/p>\n\n <p> <em>And he looked \"And he expected\"\u2014<\/em>, Jeremiah, <a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 2:21<\/a>, uses the same image, and applies it to the same purpose, in an elegant paraphrase of this part of Isaiah's parable, in his flowing and plaintive manner:\u2014<\/p>\n\n <p>\"But I planted thee a sorek, a scion perfectly genuine: How then art thou changed, and become to me the degenerate shoots of the strange vine!\" <\/p>\n\n <p> <em>Wild grapes \"poisonous berries\"\u2014 <\/em> <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d1\u05d0\u05e9\u05d9\u05dd <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, beushim<\/span>, not merely useless, unprofitable grapes, such as wild grapes; but grapes offensive to the smell, noxious, poisonous. By the force and intent of the allegory, to good grapes ought to be opposed fruit of a dangerous and pernicious quality; as, in the explication of it, to judgment is opposed tyranny, and to righteousness, oppression. <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d2\u05e4\u05df <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, gephen<\/span>, the vine, is a common name or genus, including several species under it; and Moses, to distinguish the true vine, or that from which wine is made, from the rest. calls it, <a class=\"ref\">Numbers 6:4<\/a>, <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d4\u05d9\u05d9\u05df \u05d2\u05e4\u05df <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, gephen haiyayin<\/span>, the wine-vine. Some of the other sorts were of a poisonous quality, as appears from the story related among the miraculous acts of Elisha, <a class=\"ref\">2 Kings 4:39-41<\/a>. \"And one went out into the field to gather potherbs; and he found a Seld vine, and he gathered from it wild fruit, his lapful; and he went and shred them into the pot of pottage, for they knew them not. And they poured it out for the men to eat: and it came to pass, as they were eating of the pottage, that they cried out and said, There is death in the pot, O man of God; and they could not eat of it. And he said, Bring meal, (leg. <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05e7\u05d7\u05d5 <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, kechu<\/span>, nine MSS., one edition), and he threw it into the pot. And he said, Pour out for the people, that they may eat. And there was nothing hurtful in the pot.\" <\/p>\n\n <p>From some such sorts of poisonous fruits of the grape kind Moses has taken these strong and highly poetical images, with which he has set forth the future corruption and extreme degeneracy of the Israelites, in an allegory which has a near relation, both in its subject and imagery, to this of Isaiah: <a class=\"ref\">Deuteronomy 32:32, Deuteronomy 32:33<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n <p>\"Their vine is from the vine of Sodom, <\/p>\n\n <p>And from the fields of Gomorrah: <\/p>\n\n <p>Their grapes are grapes of gall; <\/p>\n\n <p>Their clusters are bitter: <\/p>\n\n <p>Their wine is the poison of dragons, <\/p>\n\n <p>And the cruel venom of aspics.\" <\/p>\n\n <p>\"I am inclined to believe,\" says Hasselquist, \"that the prophet here, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzc0MiI6M30=\">Isaiah 5:2-4<\/a>, means the hoary nightshade, <i>solanum incanum<\/i>,; because it is common in Egypt, Palestine, and the East; and the Arabian name agrees well with it.

Chai., is a well known species of the vine, and the worst of all sorts. The prophet could not have found a plant more opposite to the vine than this; for it grows much in the vineyards, and is very pernicious to them; wherefore they root it out: it likewise resembles a vine by its shrubby stalk;\" Travels, p. 289.
