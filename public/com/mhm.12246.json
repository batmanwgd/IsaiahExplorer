Here are, I. Precious promises made to God's people in their affliction, of his presence with them, for their support under it, and their deliverance out of it, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODUwNyI6N30=\">Isaiah 43:1-7<\/a> . II. A challenge to idols to vie with the omniscience and omnipotence of God, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODUxNCI6Nn0=\">Isaiah 43:8-13<\/a> . III. Encouragement given to the people of God to hope for their deliverance out of Babylon, from the consideration of what God did for their fathers when he brought them out of Egypt, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODUyMCI6OH0=\">Isaiah 43:14-21<\/a> . IV. A method taken to prepare the people for their deliverance, by putting them in mind of their sins, by which they had provoked God to send them into captivity and continue them there, that they might repent and seek to God for pardoning mercy, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODUyOCI6N30=\">Isaiah 43:22-28<\/a> .<\/p> ",
