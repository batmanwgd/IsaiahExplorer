Nay, the time will come when all<i>the mountains shall<\/i> depart, and all<i>the hills be removed,<\/i> and even the whole earth, and all the works that are therein, shall be burned up, but then the<i>covenant of peace<\/i> between God and his church shall continue in the everlasting happiness of all the true and spiritual members of it. God will not cast off the Christian Church, as he cast off the Church of the Jews; the new covenant being established upon better and surer promises than the old; see <a class=\"ref\">Hebrews 8:6-7<\/a>. <i>Saith the Lord that hath mercy on thee<\/i>\u2014Who acts thus toward thee, not for thy merits, but through his own grace and mercy.<\/p> ",
