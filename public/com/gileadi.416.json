Like their king, they too seem to understand Jehovah&rsquo;s formula for obtaining divine protection under the terms of the Davidic Covenant&mdash;that if the people keep the king&rsquo;s law and the king keeps Jehovah&rsquo;s law, Jehovah will protect them. Hezekiah&rsquo;s emissaries don&rsquo;t just report back to the king, however. They also show their outrage at Rabshakeh&rsquo;s blasphemy by rending their garments. <\/p> ",
