There is historical importance in the fact, that here Sennacherib attributes to his fathers (Sargon and the previous kings of the Derketade dynasty which he had overthrown) what Rabshakeh on the occasion of the first mission had imputed to Sennacherib himself. On Gozan, see p. 33. It is no doubt identical with the Zuzan of the Arabian geographers, which is described as a district of outer Armenia, situated on the <i>Chabur<\/i>, e.g., in the <i>Merasid<\/i>.

The <i>Harran <\/i>in the <i>Guta<\/i> of Damascus (on the southern arm of the <i>Harus<\/i>), which Beke has recently identified with it, is not connected with it in any way. <i>Retseph<\/i> is the <i>Rhesapha<\/i> of Ptol. v. 18, 6, below Thapsacus, the present <i>Rusafa<\/i> in the Euphrates-valley of <i>ez-Zor<\/i>, between the Euphrates and Tadmur (Palmyra; see Robinson, <i>Pal<\/i>.). <i>Telassar<\/i>, with which the Targum (ii. iii.) and Syr. confound the Ellasar of <a class=\"ref\">Genesis 14:1<\/a>, i.e., Artemita (Artamita), is not the <i>Thelseae<\/i> of the <i>Itin.

Consequently the enumeration of the warlike deeds describes a curve, which passes in a north-westerly direction through Hamath and Arpad, and then returns in Sepharvaim to the border of southern Mesopotamia and Babylonia. <i>'Ir-Sepharvaim <\/i>is like <i>'Ir-N\u00e2ch\u00e2s<\/i>, <i>'Ir-shemesh<\/i>, etc. The legends connect the name with the sacred books. The form of the name is inexplicable; but the name itself probably signifies the double shore (after the Aramaean), as the city, which was the southernmost of the leading places of Mesopotamia, was situated on the Euphrates. The words <span class=\"normal hebrew\">\u05d5\u05e2\ufb35\u05d4<\/span> <span class=\"normal hebrew\">\u05d4\u05e0\u05e2<\/span>, if not take as proper names, would signify, \u201che has taken away, and overthrown;\u201d but in that case we should expect <span class=\"normal hebrew\">\u05d5\u05e2\ufb35\ufb35<\/span> <span class=\"normal hebrew\">\u05d4\u05e0\u05d9\u05e2\ufb35<\/span> or <span class=\"normal hebrew\">\u05d5\u05e2\ufb35\u05d9\u05ea\u05d9<\/span> <span class=\"normal hebrew\">\u05d4\u05e0\u05d9\u05e2\u05ea\u05d9<\/span>. They are really the names of cities which it is no longer possible to trace. <i>Hena'<\/i> is hardly the well-known <i>Avatho<\/i> on the Euphrates, as Gesenius, V.
