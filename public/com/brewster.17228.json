In regal dignity, the Prisoner refused to respond to their false accusations, \"But he held his peace, andanswered nothing.\" Only to the question, \"Art thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?\" did He give His straightforward response: \"I am.\" (<a class=\"ref\">Mark 14:55-62<\/a>.)<\/p>     <p>Further fulfillment of the prophesied silence of the Son of God when faced with his oppressors was in the presence of King Herod Antipas. Though this evil man questioned Jesus \"in many words,\" the Savior \"answered him nothing.\" (<a class=\"ref\">Luke 23:8-9<\/a>.) Elder James E. Talmage observed that \"Herod is the only character in history to whom Jesus is known to have applied a personal epithet of contempt [\"that fox\"]. \u2026 As far as we know, Herod is further distinguished as the only being who saw Christ face to face and spoke to Him, yet never heard His voice.\" (Talmage, 636.)<\/p>",
