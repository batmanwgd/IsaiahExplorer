    "html": "<p><em>They shall lift up their voice<\/em> &mdash;They who are left in the land; or who are not carried away to Babylon. &lsquo;To lift up the voice&rsquo; in the Scriptures may denote either grief or joy; compare<a class=\"ref\">Genesis 21:6; 1 Samuel 24:16; Judges 2:4; Ruth 1:9<\/a> ,..., where to lift up the voice is conected with weeping; and<a class=\"ref\">Ezekiel 21:22; Psalm 93:3<\/a> ;<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDUwXQ==\">Isaiah 40:29<\/a> ;<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDkyXQ==\">Isaiah 42:11<\/a> , etc., where it is connected with exultation and joy. The latter is evidently the idea here, that the few who would escape from captivity by fleeing to neighboring countries, would lift up their voice with exultation that they had escaped.<\/p><p><em>They shall sing for the majesty of the Lord<\/em> &mdash;They shall sing on account of the glory, or goodness of Yahweh, wire had so mercifully kept and preserved them.<\/p><p><em>They shall cry aloud from the sea<\/em> &mdash;From the isles and coasts of the Mediterranean where they would have escaped, and where they would find a refuge. No doubt many of the inhabitants adjacent to the sea, when they found the land invaded, would betake themselves to the neighboring islands, and find safety there until the danger should be overpast. Lowth renders this,<\/p><p>&lsquo;The waters shall resound with the exaltation of Jehovah,&rsquo;<\/p><p>Where he supposes \u05de\u05d9\u05dd should be rendered as if pointed \u05de\u05d9\u05dd maya\u0302m &lsquo;waters,&rsquo; not as it is in the present Hebrew text, \u05de\u05d9\u05dd miya\u0302m &lsquo;from the sea.&rsquo; The sense is not materially different; but there seems to be no good reason for departing from the usual interpretation.<\/p> ",
