Archbishop Secker was not satisfied with the present reading. He proposes another method of clearing up the sense, by reading <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d1\u05d9\u05d5\u05dd <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">,beyom <\/span>,, in the day, instead of <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d1\u05d9\u05d3\u05dd <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">,beyadam <\/span>,, in their hand: \"And he is a staff in the day of mine indignation.\" <\/p>,",
