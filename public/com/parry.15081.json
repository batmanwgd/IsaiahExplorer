    "html": " <i>ashamed. <\/i>According to Israelite tradition, shame fell on the woman who was barren or violated, or who lost all her children through death. Tyre and Sidon, portrayed as women, will be humbled and shamed. Tyre, referred to as the \"strength of the sea,\" will be virtually depopulated, her people killed, enslaved, or made refugees, and therefore unable to raise up a new generation of young men and virgins to populate the island.<\/p> <p><i>strength of the sea. <\/i>This phrase, which speaks of Tyre, can be translated as \"stronghold\" or \"fortress of the sea.\" <\/p> <p><i>I travail not, nor bring forth children, neither do I nourish up. <\/i>Tyre, presented as a barren or vanquished woman, speaks of the shame she will feel when she becomes childless through the loss of sons and daughters in battle. It will be as if Tyre had never been populated and the sea had never been a major shipping lane.<\/p> <p><i>young men\/virgins. <\/i>The lack of young men and virgins implies the loss of honor and life, symbolizing Tyre's destruction and the enslavement of her inhabitants. So will it be with the wicked in the last days.<\/p> ",
