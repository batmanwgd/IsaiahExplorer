    "html": "<p>Jehovah pronounces a third &ldquo;woe&rdquo; or covenant curse on his people who are obsessed with worldly pastimes that they cannot or will not give up. They compulsively haul their baggage&mdash;their beloved idols&mdash;with them wherever they go. Robbing them of Jehovah&rsquo;s Spirit, their preoccupations and distractions from reality add to their sins and transgressions, diverting them away from Jehovah&rsquo;s &ldquo;work&rdquo; and &ldquo;plan&rdquo; instead of participating in them (cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzUyXQ==\">v 12<\/a>). They mock his people who anticipate the impending fulfillment of Jehovah&rsquo;s purposes by glibly asking for signs to satisfy their curiosity (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 66:5<\/a>).<\/p>",
