    "html": "<p>As his people&rsquo;s exemplar, Jehovah typifies all that his people may become. Having undergone a descent phase below all others (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODcxNCI6OX0=\">Isaiah 53:2-10<\/a>), Jehovah merits an ascent phase above all others. Nevertheless, those who emulate him and grow in holiness may acquire his divine attributes. As Jehovah is &ldquo;highly exalted&rdquo; (<em>ram wenissa&rsquo;<\/em>), for example (cf.<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzcxXQ==\">Isaiah 6:1<\/a>), so his servant becomes &ldquo;highly exalted&rdquo; (<em>yarum wenissa&rsquo;<\/em>) (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzEwXQ==\">Isaiah 52:13<\/a> ; cf.<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzQ2XQ==\">55:5<\/a>). As Jehovah&rsquo;s name is &ldquo;sacred&rdquo; or &ldquo;holy,&rdquo; so he endows his holy ones &ldquo;with an everlasting name that shall not be cut off&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzU5XQ==\">Isaiah 56:5<\/a> ; cf.<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzM3LDE4ODY3LDE4OTQ1XQ==\">4:3; 62:12; 66:22<\/a>).<\/p><p>As Jehovah &ldquo;abides forever,&rdquo; so his righteous people &ldquo;inherit the earth forever&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODQzXQ==\">Isaiah 60:21<\/a>). As he &ldquo;dwells on high in the holy place,&rdquo; so those whom Jehovah exalts dwell on high (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDQ3XQ==\">Isaiah 40:26<\/a>) and live in the holy city (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODMwMF0seyIxODY5OCI6Mn0sWzE4ODY3XV0=\">Isaiah 33:20; 52:1-2; 62:12<\/a>). Because Jehovah&rsquo;s dwelling with the &ldquo;humble and lowly in spirit&rdquo; is no less literal than his dwelling on high (cf.<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4OTI0XQ==\">Isaiah 66:1<\/a>), his regenerating them empowers them to ultimately &ldquo;ascend as on eagles&rsquo; wings&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDUyXQ==\">Isaiah 40:31<\/a>) to live in his presence forever (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MDk2LDE4MTE5LDE4NDQ3LDE4NDUwLDE4ODM2XQ==\">Isaiah 23:18; 24:23; 40:26, 29; 60:14<\/a>) and to view the earth from above (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4Mjk3XQ==\">Isaiah 33:17<\/a> ; cf.<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODAxXQ==\">58:14<\/a>).<\/p> ",
