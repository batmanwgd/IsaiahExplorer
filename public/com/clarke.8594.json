That the greatest care in driving the cattle in regard to the dams and their young was necessary, appears clearly from Jacob's apology to his brother Esau,  <a class=\"ref\">Genesis 33:13<\/a>; : \"The flocks and the herds giving suck to their young are with me; and if they should be overdriven, all the flock will die.\" Which is set in a still stronger light by the following remark of Sir John Chardin: \"Their flocks,\" says he, speaking of those who now live in the east after the patriarchal manner, \"feed down the places of their encampments so quick, by the great numbers that they have, that they are obliged to remove them too often, which is very destructive to their flocks, on account of the young ones, who have not strength enough to follow.\" Harmer's Observ. i., p. 126.<\/p>",
