    "html": "<p>Like Israel&rsquo;s ethnic lineages that she represents, the Woman Zion was fearful, confounded, ashamed, and disgraced during the long centuries of covenant curses she endured while divorced from her husband. When she renews the covenant, however, her curses turn into blessings. Having decided that loyalty to her husband&mdash;her Maker, Jehovah of Hosts, the Holy One of Israel, the God of all the earth&mdash;is for her and her children&rsquo;s best good, her afflictions vanish. Though in times past she made poor choices, suffering barrenness and reproach from neighbors, she happily reunites with her Redeemer.<\/p> ",
