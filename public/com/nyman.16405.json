Another Babylon is identified in the Doctrine and Covenants as \"spiritual Babylon\" and is defined as wickedness (see <a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 133:14<\/a>). Various other sections in the Doctrine and Covenants use Babylon in this context (see <a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 1:16; 35:11; 64:24; 86:3<\/a>). The book of Revelation also speaks repeatedly of the fall of Babylon in the last days, which has reference to the fall of the kingdom of the devil (see <a class=\"ref\">Rev. 14:8; 16:19; 17:5; 18:2, 10, 21<\/a>). Jeremiah chapters 50 and 51 contain the words of the Lord against Babylon by Jeremiah the prophet; these sayings are more detailed than Isaiah's and seem directed toward ancient Babylon. <\/p>     ",
