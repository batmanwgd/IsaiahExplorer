    "html": "<p>With great irony, Isaiah brought out the inconsistency of those who work wood and metal, use it for firewood and other mundane things, but fashion idols from the same material and then expect those idols to show forth great power and answer their prayers. Such idolatry precipitates in man &ldquo;a deceived heart&rdquo; that has &ldquo;turned him aside&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTg1MjY=\">v. 20<\/a>), or in other words, that has such a negative effect as to cause him to lose his soul. Though this principle is true, and obvious to the spiritually alert, the idolater cannot recognize nor admit that there is &ldquo;a lie in [his] right hand&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTg1MjY=\">v. 20<\/a>). This tragic phrase reflects the dire consequences for one who lives a lie. Since the right hand is the covenant hand (see Smith, <em>Doctrines of Salvation,<\/em> 3:107&ndash;8), this phrase implies that those who continue to seek treasures, or to worship false gods, become blinded to the truth and cannot recognize that their covenants are broken and become to them as lies that will condemn them at the last day.<\/p><p class=\"cite\">LDS Church Educational System Old Testament Student Manual, 1 Kings&ndash;Malachi, Religion 302, Chapter 16, Item 29<\/p>",
