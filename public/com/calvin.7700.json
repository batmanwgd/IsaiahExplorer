Hence he infers that the manifestations of his divinity, being so clear, ought to prevent them from giving their hearts to another. <\/p>\n <p> <i>That I am God.<\/i>, In this passage the particle <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05db\u05d9<\/span>, (<i>ki<\/i>) does not signify <i>for<\/i>, but <i>that,<\/i>, and introduces a clause which explains what goes before. Besides, as we have formerly explained, God wishes not only that he may be acknowledged, but that he alone may be acknowledged; and therefore he wishes to be separated from all the gods which men have made for themselves, that we may fix our whole attention on him; because, if he admitted any companion, his throne would fall or shake; for either there is one God or there is none at all. <\/p>",
