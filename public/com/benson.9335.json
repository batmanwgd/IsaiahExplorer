The grave is called man\u2019s <i>long home, <\/i> <a class=\"ref\">Ecclesiastes 12:5<\/a>; and <i>the house appointed for all living, <\/i> <a class=\"ref\">Job 30:23<\/a>; and death opens the gates of this house. <i>I am deprived of the residue of my years <\/i>\u2014Which I might have lived according to the common course of nature, and of God\u2019s dispensations; and which I hoped to live for the service of God and of my generation. <i>I shall not see the Lord <\/i>\u2014I shall not behold his beauty and glory as he manifests them in his temple, in his oracles and ordinances; I shall not enjoy him: for <i>seeing <\/i> is frequently put for enjoying; <i>even the Lord in the land of the living <\/i>\u2014In this world, which is often so called; which limitation is prudently added, to intimate that he expected to see God in another place and manner, on the other side death; but he despairs of seeing him any more on this side death, as he had seen him in the sanctuary, <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 63:2<\/a>. <i>I shall behold man no more. <\/i> &c.\u2014I shall have no more society with men upon earth. Many good men, under the law, had but imperfect notions of a future state, and thought it a great unhappiness to be deprived, by death, of the communion of saints here upon earth. But by <i>not seeing the Lord in the land of the living, <\/i> Hezekiah might probably mean that he should not see the effects of God\u2019s grace and goodness in the deliverance of his people. <\/p> ",
