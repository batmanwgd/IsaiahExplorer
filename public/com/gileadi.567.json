    "html": "<p>Although Jehovah&rsquo;s servant is at first &ldquo;despised as a person&rdquo; and &ldquo;abhorred by his nation&rdquo; as his own reject him, Jehovah exalts him in the eyes of those who see him as a threat to their authority. Jehovah rewards his servant&rsquo;s faithfulness toward him in the face of opposition with his own acts of faithfulness toward his servant. Henceforth, as the servant begins the temporal phase of Jacob\/Israel&rsquo;s restoration, he becomes prominent worldwide (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 11:10-12; 52:15; 55:5<\/a>). Kings and princes now honor him who was dishonored and assist in the restoration of Jehovah&rsquo;s people (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg2NTkiOjJ9LHsiMTg4MjUiOjl9XQ==\">vv 22-23; Isaiah 60:3-11<\/a>).<\/p>",
