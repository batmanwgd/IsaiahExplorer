Horonaim was also a city of Moab, situated probably in the descent from Luhith. <i>They shall raise up a cry of destruction <\/i>\u2014Such a cry as men send forth when they are just falling into the pit of destruction. He signifies that the cry should be universal in all places where they should come, and reaching from one side of the country to the other. <\/p> ",
