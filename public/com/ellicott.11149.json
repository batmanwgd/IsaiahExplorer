    "html": " <p> (22) As prisoners are gathered in the pit . . .\u2014The imagery is drawn from the deep underground dungeons of Eastern prisons (<a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 38:6 <\/a>), which are here the symbol of the abyss of Hades, in which the rebel powers of earth and heaven await the final judgment (<a class=\"ref\">2 Peter 2:4; Jude 1:6 <\/a>). <\/p> \n <p>After many days shall they be visited.\u2014The verb is the same as that translated \u201cpunish\u201d in the previous verse, but does not in itself involve the idea of punishing, and in some of its forms is used of visiting in mercy. Interpreters have, according to their previous bias, assigned this or that meaning to it. Probably the prophet used it in a neutral sense, drawing his imagery from the custom of Eastern kings, who, after leaving their enemies in prison for an appointed time, came to inspect them, and to award punishment or pardon according to their deserts. In such a company there might be \u201cprisoners of hope\u201d (<a class=\"ref\">Zechariah 9:12 <\/a>), waiting with eager expectation for the coming of the king. The passage is interesting in the history of Christian doctrine, as having furnished to Origen and his followers an argument in favour of the ultimate restitution of all created spirits. <\/p> ",
