She was to be degraded and endure sufferings; and is represented sitting on the ground, grinding at the hand mill, the lowest and most laborious service. God was righteous in his vengeance, and none should interpose. The prophet exults in the Lord of hosts, as the Redeemer and Holy One of Israel. God often permits wicked men to prevail against his people; but those who cruelly oppress them will be punished.\n <\/p> ",
