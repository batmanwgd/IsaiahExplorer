He shall not seek a blessing from a false god; but he shall come before the true God, and seek a blessing at his hand.<\/p><p><em>And he that sweareth<\/em>&mdash;Every oath that is taken in the land shall be by the true God. There shall be no swearing by idols; but the true God shall be everywhere acknowledged.<\/p><p><em>Because the former troubles are forgotten<\/em>&mdash;The former punishments and calamities shall be passed away. The favor of God shall be restored. His pure worship shall be re-established, and his name shall be celebrated again in the land. The image here is one of returning prosperity and favor; a state when the happiness will be so great that all the former trials will be regarded as not worthy of recollection.<\/p> ",
