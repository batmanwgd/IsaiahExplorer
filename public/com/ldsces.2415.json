    "html": "<p>For centuries the covenant people of the Lord have &ldquo;drunk at the hand of the Lord the cup of his fury,&rdquo; or in other words, they reaped the results of their refusal to heed His word and this &ldquo;wrung them out&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NjkxXQ==\">Isaiah 51:17<\/a>). And the days of judgments for Israel are not finished yet. In the battle of Armageddon, the Jewish nation will once again undergo great oppression and judgment (see Enrichment I).<\/p><p>The text of <a class=\"ref\">2 Nephi 8:19&ndash;20<\/a>taken from the brass plates suggests that the two sons may be the two witnesses of <a class=\"ref\">Revelation 11:1&ndash;6<\/a>who will keep the armies from defeating the Jews (see also <a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 77:15<\/a>). The two witnesses are discussed in detail in Reading I-6.<\/p><p>By means of these two servants of God and the miracles they work, God will remove from Israel&rsquo;s hand &ldquo;the cup of trembling, even the dregs of the cup of my fury.&rdquo; The promise is &ldquo;thou shalt no more drink it again&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4Njk2XQ==\">Isaiah 51:22<\/a>.) Instead, the cup of fury shall be given to those who have trampled on and walked over the covenant people of the Lord. It will then be their turn to know suffering.
