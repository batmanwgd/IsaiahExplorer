The honorable men (upper class and city dignitaries) and the multitude (commoners) \"have no knowledge\" of the Lord and his gospel; they lack the words of the Lord; \"behold, the days come, saith the Lord God, that I will send a famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the Lord\" (<a class=\"ref\">Amos 8:11<\/a>). Specifically, the wicked lack an understanding of Jesus Christ and the power of his atonement; they do not partake of the \"bread\" (<a class=\"ref\">John 6:33,  48<\/a>) and waters (<a class=\"ref\">Jer. 2:13; 17:13<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\">1 Ne. 2:9; Ether 12:28<\/a>) of life, which refer to Jesus Christ. Although they partake of \"strong drink\" and \"wine,\" they experience famine and thirst for spiritual things. By contrast, the righteous have the privilege of feasting on the words of Christ as well as on his love (<a class=\"ref\">Jacob 3:2<\/a>), and of renewing their covenants by the sacrament.<\/p> ",
