Designed to turn his people&rsquo;s hearts back to him&mdash;to motivate them to repent&mdash;they demonstrate that Jehovah is in charge and that their only recourse in alleviating them is to align themselves with him and keep the terms of his covenant. The king of Assyria\/Babylon may be &ldquo;him who smites them&rdquo; physically, but it is Jehovah who is doing the smiting and of whom they may &ldquo;inquire&rdquo; and get answers instead of from the dead (cf.<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc4MjciOjJ9LFsxODc0NywxODg5OV1d\">Isaiah 8:19-20; 55:6; 65:1<\/a>).<\/p> ",
