Not only our principal cities, but even our temple, which we thought sacred and inviolable, in which we gloried, because it was <i>thine, <\/i>and our fathers\u2019 house, and ours: the place where thy holy service was performed, and thy glory and presence were wont to be manifested. <i>Where our fathers praised thee <\/i>\u2014 They do not presume to mention themselves, having been every way so very abominable; but put the Lord in mind of their fathers, many of whom were his faithful servants, having praised him there. <i>Is burned up with fire <\/i>\u2014 This relates to the burning of the temple by the Romans, who made an entire destruction of it, according to our Saviour\u2019s prediction, <a class=\"ref\">Matthew 24:2<\/a>. <i>And all our pleasant things are laid waste<\/i> \u2014 Not only the <i>pleasant land, <\/i>but all that was magnificent, ornamental, or desirable in Jerusalem, or any other city, town, or place. <i>Wilt thou refrain, <\/i>or, <i>contain, thyself for, <\/i>or, <i>at, these things <\/i>\u2014 Wilt thou behold them unmoved, as an indifferent spectator? Wilt thou neither show thy compassion toward thy servants, nor thy resentment toward thine enemies? <i>Wilt thou hold thy peace <\/i>\u2014 Wilt thou be as one that regards not? <i>And afflict us very sore <\/i>\u2014 And persist to afflict us in thy continued hot displeasure? <\/p>",
