The figure of the new maternity of Zion, and of her children as <em> quasimodogeniti <\/em> , is still preserved. The members of the church can then revel in peace and wealth, like a child at its mother's breasts. The world is now altogether in the possession of the church, because the church is altogether God's. The allusion to the heathen leads on to the thought, which was already expressed in a similar manner in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NjU5XQ==\">Isaiah 49:22<\/a> and <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODI2XQ==\">Isaiah 60:4<\/a> : \u201con the side (arm or shoulder) will ye be carried, and fondled ( \u05e9\u05c1\u05e2\u05e9\u05c1\u05e2 , <em> pulpal<\/em> of the <em> pilpel<\/em> \u05e9\u05c1\u05e2\u05e9\u05c1\u05e2 , <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODkzXQ==\">Isaiah 11:8<\/a>) upon the knees,\u201d viz., by the heathen, who will vie with one another in the effort to show you tenderness and care (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NjYwXQ==\">Isaiah 49:23<\/a>).<\/p>",
