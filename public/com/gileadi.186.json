    "html": "<p>Destruction by the archtyrant&mdash;Jehovah&rsquo;s <em>anger<\/em> and <em>wrath<\/em>&mdash;extends to cosmic cataclysm and the earth&rsquo;s being jarred from its orbit because of wickedness: &ldquo;The earth shall be crushed and rent; the earth shall break up and cave in; the earth shall convulse and lurch. The earth shall reel to and fro like a drunkard, sway back and forth like a shanty; its transgressions weigh it down, and when it collapses it shall rise no more&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgxMTUiOjJ9XQ==\">Isaiah 24:19-20<\/a>). After the earth&rsquo;s dislocation serves his purpose, Jehovah &ldquo;replants the heavens and sets the earth in place&rdquo; in a new cosmic trajectory (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg2OTAiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 51:16<\/a>; cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg5MTUiOjF9LHsiMTg5NDUiOjF9XQ==\">65:17; 66:22<\/a>).<\/p>",
