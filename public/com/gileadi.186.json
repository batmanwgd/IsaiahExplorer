    "html": " <p>Destruction by the archtyrant&mdash;Jehovah&rsquo;s <em>anger <\/em> and <em>wrath <\/em>&mdash;extends to cosmic cataclysm and the earth&rsquo;s being jarred from its orbit because of wickedness: &ldquo;The earth shall be crushed and rent; the earth shall break up and cave in; the earth shall convulse and lurch. The earth shall reel to and fro like a drunkard, sway back and forth like a shanty; its transgressions weigh it down, and when it collapses it shall rise no more&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODExNSI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 24:19-20<\/a>). After the earth&rsquo;s dislocation serves his purpose, Jehovah &ldquo;replants the heavens and sets the earth in place&rdquo; in a new cosmic trajectory (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NjkwXQ==\">Isaiah 51:16<\/a>; cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4OTE1LDE4OTQ1XQ==\">65:17; 66:22<\/a>). <\/p> ",
