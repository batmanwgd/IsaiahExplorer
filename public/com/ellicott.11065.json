Month by month, for three whole years, he was seen in the streets of Jerusalem as one who was already as a prisoner of war, ready to be led into an ignominious exile. The \u201csackcloth\u201d was the \u201crough garment\u201d which, like Elijah (<a class=\"ref\">2 Kings 1:8<\/a>) and John the Baptist, the prophets habitually wore (<a class=\"ref\">Zechariah 13:4<\/a>), and the \u201cnakedness\u201d was confined to the laying aside this outer robe, and appearing in the short tunic worn near the body (<a class=\"ref\">1 Samuel 19:24; 2 Samuel 6:14-20; John 21:7<\/a>). Like instances of prophetic symbolism are the horns of Zedekiah in<a class=\"ref\">1 Kings 22:11<\/a> , the yokes worn by Jeremiah (<a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 27:2<\/a>), Ezekiel\u2019s lying on his side (<a class=\"ref\">Ezekiel 4:4<\/a>), and the girdle with which Agabus bound himself (<a class=\"ref\">Acts 21:11<\/a>).<\/p> ",
