As the one who served as Jehovah&rsquo;s <em>sword<\/em> did to others, so it is done to him. Instead of being a protector of his people and their land, as befits a king, he engineered their destruction by taking them to war against Jehovah&rsquo;s elect. As a mass murderer, he suffers the covenant curse of no burial for his carcass, becoming the poster child for a &ldquo;brood of miscreants&rdquo; whose memory is erased from the earth (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgxNDQiOjJ9XQ==\">Isaiah 26:13-14<\/a>).<\/p>",
