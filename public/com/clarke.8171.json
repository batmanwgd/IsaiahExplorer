Archbishop Secker approves this reading. <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d3\u05e2\u05d5 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">deu<\/span>  know ye this, is parallel and synonymous to <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d4\u05d0\u05d6\u05d9\u05e0\u05d5 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">haazinu<\/span>, give ear to It, in the next line. The Septuagint have likewise very well paraphrased the conclusion of this verse: \"When ye have strengthened yourselves, ye shall be broken; and though ye again strengthen yourselves, again shall ye be broken;\" taking <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d7\u05ea\u05d5 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">chottu<\/span>  as meaning the same with <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05e0\u05e9\u05d1\u05e8\u05d5 <\/span>, shall be broken.<\/p>",
