Or perhaps these stones refer to the smooth stones from a stream that David used to slay Goliath (<a class=\"ref\">1 Sam. 17:40-50<\/a>). The people here were choosing the smooth stones of the stream instead of the Rock who is their Redeemer (<a class=\"ref\">Ps. 78:35; Moses 7:53<\/a>). <\/p> <p><i>stream.<\/i> The Hebrew word used here, <i>nachal, <\/i>can also mean \"valley<i>.<\/i>\" The wicked reject the living waters for unholy streams.<\/p> <p><i>portion\/lot.<\/i> The Lord should be the lot, portion, or inheritance for covenant Israel (<a class=\"ref\">Ps. 16:5; 119:57<\/a>). But in rejecting him and turning to false gods, her inheritance is only what the false gods made of stone could give her (<a class=\"ref\">Ezek. 6:13<\/a>). That is also true of us in the latter days, when we choose things of the world over God. Another interpretation is that the lot of idol worshipers is death and destruction, the just desserts of their sinfulness.<\/p> <p><i>drink offering\/meat offering.<\/i> These are sacrifices that God required to be made in the temple (<a class=\"ref\">Lev. 6:14-18,  23<\/a>) instead they are given to idols. The greatest sacrifice, of course, is our hearts, but most people give their hearts to the wrong things.<\/p> ",
