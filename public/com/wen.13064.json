For this work was not performed by horses, as now it is, but by the labour of slaves and captives. Grind\u2014Grind bread\u2014corn into meal for thy master's use. Uncover\u2014Take off the ornaments wherewith such women as were of good quality, used to cover and dress their heads. These are predictions of what they should be forced to do or suffer. Thigh\u2014Gird up thy garments close and short about thee, that thou mayest be fit for travelling on foot, and for passing over those rivers, through which thou wilt be constrained to wade, in the way to the land of thy captivity.",
