The Hebrew nouns for \u201cteats\u201d and \u201cfields,\u201d Sh\u00e2daim and Sad\u00e8, have an assonance which may be represented by the Latin ubera and ubertas. In the renewed, unabated luxury of the women of Jerusalem Isaiah sees the precursor of another time of desolation like that which he had foretold before in the reign of Ahaz (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODA3XQ==\">Isaiah 7:24 <\/a>). \u201cThorns and briers\u201d are again to take the place of the fair gardens in the outskirts of Jerusalem during the invasion of Sennacherib, as they had once before in that of Rezin and Pekah. The \u201chouses of joy\u201d are manifestly what we should call the stately villas of the rich. <\/p> ",
