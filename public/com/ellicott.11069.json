The \u201csea\u201d has been explained (1) as the Euphrates, just as in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MDAwLDE4MDEwXQ==\">Isaiah 18:2; Isaiah 19:5<\/a>, it appears as used of the Nile (Cheyne). (2) As pointing to the surging flood of the mingled myriads of its population. (3) Xenophon\u2019s description of the whole plain of the Euphrates, intersected by marshes and lakes, as looking like a sea affords, perhaps, a better explanation. <\/p>\n <p>As whirlwinds in the south . . .\u2014The \u201cSouth\u201d (or Negeb) is here, as elsewhere, the special name of the country lying south of Judah. The tempests of the region seem to have been proverbial (<a class=\"ref\">Zechariah 9:14; Jeremiah 4:11; Jeremiah 13:24; Hosea 13:15<\/a>). <\/p>\n <p>So it cometh.\u2014The absence of a subject to the verb gives the opening words a terrible vagueness. Something is coming \u201cfrom the wilderness, a terrible land,\u201d beyond it. The \u201cwilderness\u201d in this case is clearly the Arabian desert, through part of which the Euphrates flows. The context determines the \u201cterrible land\u201d as that of Elam and Media. <\/p>",
