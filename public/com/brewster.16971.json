We are reminded of the apostle Paul's declaration to the converts to Christ of his day: \"Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God.\" (<a class=\"ref\">Ephesians 2:19<\/a>.) Furthermore, we think of the promise regarding the posterity of the great patriarch Abraham, grandfather of Jacob: \"And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.\" (<a class=\"ref\">Galatians 3:29<\/a>.) By accepting the gospel, \"There is neither Jew nor Greek [Gentile] \u2026 for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.\" (<a class=\"ref\">Galatians 3:28<\/a>.)<\/p>",
