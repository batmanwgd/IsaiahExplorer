    "html": "<p>Tribulation prevails for Jehovah&rsquo;s people as they suffer (1) desolation and ruin, and (2) famine and the sword until Jehovah reverses the circumstances of those who repent (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODY5NSI6M30=\">vv 21-23<\/a>). Whether meted out through the king of Assyria\/Babylon or his proxies&mdash;Jehovah&rsquo;s <em>sword<\/em> and <em>wrath<\/em>&mdash;the descent phase of Jehovah&rsquo;s people through trials and afflictions is proportional to their ascent phase as they are reborn or re-created on higher spiritual levels. The term &ldquo;twofold,&rdquo; therefore, suggests that for those of Jehovah&rsquo;s people who didn&rsquo;t repent in time, double trouble finally brings them to such rebirth.<\/p>",
