    "html": "<p>Two kinds of perception are evident toward the messianic person in question: (1) from a people astray or who believe their own version of God&rsquo;s revelation and who thus feel threatened by one who embodies the truth; and (2) from righteous individuals who aren&rsquo;t offended by God&rsquo;s revelation (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc4ODYiOjF9XQ==\">v 1<\/a>) because they themselves live the truth as best they know how. The pronouns &ldquo;us,&rdquo; &ldquo;our,&rdquo; and &ldquo;we&rdquo;&mdash;used by a spokesman for Jehovah&rsquo;s people such as his servant&mdash;show that those in the alienated category may in the end realize the true nature of the person they have erstwhile &ldquo;despised&rdquo; and &ldquo;disdained.&rdquo;<\/p><p>Although the subject of <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc4OTUiOjF9XQ==\">verses 1-10<\/a> is Israel&rsquo;s God Jehovah, the King of Zion (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg3MDQiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 52:7<\/a>), he appears to his people as &ldquo;a man&rdquo; (cf. <a class=\"ref\">Genesis 18:1-16<\/a>). In the pattern of descent before ascent that every proxy savior experiences under the terms of the Davidic Covenant (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgzNzMiOjR9LHsiMTgzOTIiOjZ9XQ==\">Isaiah 37:20, 33-35; 38:1-6<\/a>), Jehovah too suffers as a man in the course of redeeming his people before he comes to reign on the earth as King of Zion (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg1MzAiOjJ9LHsiMTg1NTYiOjF9LHsiMTg4MjAiOjJ9LHsiMTg4NjYiOjF9LHsiMTg4NzUiOjJ9XQ==\">Isaiah 43:24-25; 44:22; 59:19-20; 62:11; 63:8-9<\/a>). Considered a reprobate and under a curse, he bears the iniquities of reprobates by taking their curses on himself in order to reverse them.<\/p><p>The seven pairs of antithetical themes of Isaiah&rsquo;s Seven-Part Structure&mdash;Ruin &amp; Rebirth, Rebellion &amp; Compliance, Punishment &amp; Deliverance, Humiliation &amp; Exaltation, Suffering &amp; Salvation, Disloyalty &amp; Loyalty, Disinheritance &amp; Inheritance&mdash;are evident in Jehovah more than in any person. While he undergoes ruin, punishment, humiliation, suffering, and disinheritance, he does so on behalf of those who are rebellious and disloyal. But because he is compliant and loyal, he experiences rebirth, deliverance, exaltation, salvation, and inheritance in the end as an example to all who emulate him.<\/p>",
