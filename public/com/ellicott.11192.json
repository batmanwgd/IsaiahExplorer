The words repeat the thought of the previous clause. The fruit of repentance and forgiveness will be found in rooting out all vestiges of idol-worship. The LXX., \u201cwhen I shall take away their sins,\u201d is quoted by St. Paul in <a class=\"ref\">Romans 11:27 <\/a>. <\/p> \n <p>The groves and images.\u2014Literally, as elsewhere, the Asherahs, or the sun-images, the two leading features of the cultus which Israel had borrowed from the Ph\u0153nicians. In the action of Josiah (<a class=\"ref\">2 Chronicles 34:3-4 <\/a>) we may, with little doubt, trace a conscious endeavour to fulfil the condition which Isaiah had thus proclaimed. He sought to \u201cpurge\u201d Judah and Jerusalem from the \u201cgroves and the carved (sun) images, and molten images.\u201d <\/p> ",
