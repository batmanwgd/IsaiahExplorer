Though thou hast afflicted us, (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTM5XQ==\">Isaiah 26:8<\/a>.) yet the time will come when we shall be in a very different, yea, in a happy condition. Or, referring to what he had last said, he means, as thou wilt destroy thine and our enemies, so thou wilt bless us; thy people, with peace and prosperity. <i>For thou hast wrought all our works in us <\/i>\u2014 Hebrew,  <span class=\"hebrew_text\">\u05dc\u05e0\u05d5<\/span>, <i>to, <\/i>or <i>for us. <\/i>All the good works done by us are the effects of thy grace. And all the good and great works which have been wrought for us, all the wonderful deliverances and singular blessings vouchsafed us, came from thee. The argument is this: God hath done great things for us, and delivered us formerly upon many occasions, and therefore he will still deliver us, and give us peace.<\/p>",
