Greedy dogs, instead of selflessly protecting their flocks, feed themselves and perhaps even turn on the sheep to satisfy their own ravenous appetites (<a class=\"ref\">Ezek. 34:3,  10<\/a>). Like dumb, greedy dogs, Israel's religious leaders lost the power to warn Israel of sin, selfishly thinking more of their own needs than of those of the people (5:13). That is also true of some religious leaders in all time periods.<\/p> <p><i>shepherds.<\/i> <i>Shepherds<\/i> are the leaders of the flock of God, in this case leaders who desire their own advancement and thus practice priestcrafts (<a class=\"ref\">2 Ne. 26:29<\/a>). <\/p> <p><i>own way\/his gain\/his quarter.<\/i> The shepherds are charged with willfulness, seeking that which will bring profit to themselves rather than blessings to the people. Our purpose in life is to be tested and proved, \"to see if [we] will do all things whatsoever the Lord [our] God shall command [us]\" (<a class=\"ref\">Abr. 3:25<\/a>). But like those in this passage, many seek their own will and their own desires, rather than the Father's (53:6; <a class=\"ref\">Judg. 17:6; 1 Cor. 13:5<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\">Philip. 2:21; Mosiah 16:5<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 1:16<\/a>). Even some of those who are called to be shepherds concentrate on worldly pursuits and pleasures, neglecting the flock. As in all things, Jesus Christ set the great example for us in these things, saying, \"Not my will, but thine, be done\" (<a class=\"ref\">Luke 22:42<\/a>). <\/p> ",
