    "html": "<p> Whilst the people on the fast-day are carrying on their worldly, selfish, everyday business, the fasting is perverted from a means of divine worship and absorption in the spiritual character of the day to the most thoroughly selfish purposes: it is supposed to be of some worth and to merit some reward. This work-holy delusion, behind which self-righteousness and unrighteousness were concealed, is met thus by Jehovah through His prophet: <em> \u201cCan such things as these pass for a fast that I have pleasure in, as a day for a man to afflict his soul? To bow down his head like a bulrush, and spread sackcloth and ashes under him - dost thou call this a fast and an acceptable day for Jehovah? Is not this a fast that I have pleasure in: To loose coils of wickedness, to untie the bands of the yoke, and for sending away the oppressed as free, and that ye break every kind of yoke? Is it not this, to break thy bread to the hungry, and to take the poor and houseless to thy home; when thou seest a naked man that thou clothest him, and dost not deny thyself before thine own flesh?\u201d<\/em> The true worship, which consists in works of merciful love to one's brethren, and its great promises are here placed in contrast with the false worship just described. \u05d4\u05db\u05d6\u05d4 points backwards: is such a fast as this a fast after Jehovah's mind, a day on which it can be said in truth that a man afflicts his soul (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzY1NiI6MzF9\">, in vindication of what was stated at <a class=\"isa\">Isaiah 10:27<\/a>, that the yoke was not in the form of a collar. I brought the subject under the notice of Prof. Schegg, who wrote to me immediately after his return from his journey to Palestine to the following effect: \u201cI saw many oxen ploughing in Egypt, Palestine, Syria, and the neighbourhood of Ephesus; and in every case the yoke was a cross piece of wood laid upon the neck of the animal, and fastened to the pole of the plough by a cord which passed under the neck of the animal.\u201d)<\/p><p> It is to this that \u05d0\u05d2\u05d3\u05bc\u05d5\u05ea , knots, refers. We cannot connect it with <em> m utteh <\/em> , a state of perverted right (<a class=\"ref\">Ezekiel 9:9<\/a>), as Hitzig does. \u05e8\u05e6\u05d5\u05bc\u05e6\u05d9\u05dd are persons unjustly and forcibly oppressed even with cruelty; \u05e8\u05e6 \u05e5 is a stronger synonym to \u05e2\u05e9\u05c2\u05e7 (e.g., <a class=\"ref\">Amos 4:1<\/a>). In <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4Nzk0XQ==\">Isaiah 58:7<\/a> we have the same spirit of general humanity as in <a class=\"ref\">Job 31:13-23; Ezekiel 18:7-8<\/a> (compare what James describes in <a class=\"ref\">James 1:27<\/a> as \u201cpure religion and undefiled\u201d). \u05dc\u05d7\u05dd ( \u05e4\u05e8\u05e9\u05c2 ) \u05e4\u05e8 \u05e5 is the usual phrase for \u03ba\u03bb\u03b1\u0342\u03bd ( \u03ba\u03bb\u03b1\u0301\u03b6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd ) \u03b1\u0313\u0301\u03c1\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd . \u05de\u05e8\u05d5\u05bc\u05d3\u05d9\u05dd is the adjective to \u05e2\u05e0\u05d9\u05bc\u05d9\u05dd , and apparently therefore must be derived from \u05de\u05e8\u05d3 : miserable men who have shown themselves refractory towards despotic rulers. But the participle <em> m a\u0302ru\u0304d <\/em> cannot be found elsewhere; and the recommendation to receive political fugitives has a modern look. The parallels in <a class=\"ref\">Lamentations 1:7<\/a> and <a class=\"ref\">Lamentations 3:19<\/a> are conclusive evidence, that the word is intended as a derivative of \u05e8\u05d5\u05bc\u05d3 , to wander about, and it is so rendered in the lxx, Targ., and Jerome (<em> vagos <\/em> ). But \u05de\u05e8\u05d5\u05d3 , pl. \u05de\u05e8\u05d5\u05bc\u05d3\u05d9\u05dd , is no adjective; and there is nothing to recommend the opinion, that by \u201cwanderers\u201d we are to understand Israelitish men. Ewald supposes that \u05de\u05e8\u05d5\u05bc\u05d3\u05d9\u05dd may be taken as a <em> part. hoph<\/em> . for \u05de\u05d5\u05bc\u05e8\u05d3\u05d9\u05dd , hunted away, like \u05d4\u05de\u05de\u05d5\u05ea\u05d9\u05dd in <a class=\"ref\">2 Kings 11:2<\/a> (<em> Keri<\/em> \u05d4\u05de\u05bc\u05de\u05ea\u05d9\u05dd ); but it cannot be shown that the language allowed of this shifting of a vowel-sound. We prefer to assume that \u05de\u05e8\u05d5\u05bc\u05d3\u05d9\u05dd (persecuted) is regarded as <em> part. pass.<\/em> , even if only <em> per metaplasmum <\/em> , from \u05de\u05e8\u05d3 , a secondary form of \u05e8\u05d5\u05bc\u05d3 (cf., \u05de\u05db\u05e1 , \u05de\u05dc \u05e5 , \u05de\u05e6\u05d7 , <em> m akuna <\/em> ).  is still the virtual subject to \u05d0\u05d1\u05d7\u05e8\u05d4\u05d5\u05bc \u05e6\u05d5\u05dd . The apodosis to the hypothetical \u05db\u05bc\u05d9 commences with a <em> perf. consec.<\/em> , which then passes into the pausal future \u05ea\u05ea\u05e2\u05dc\u05bc\u05dd . In hsilgnE:egaugnaL\\ \u05de\u05d1\u05e9\u05c2\u05e8 \u05da (from thine own flesh) it is presupposed that all men form one united whole as being of the same flesh and blood, and that they form one family, owing to one another mutual love.<\/p>",
