    "html": " <p>(23) I will fasten him as a nail in a sure place . . .\u2014The word for \u201cnail\u201d is used both for the peg that fastens a tent to the ground, as in the \u201cstakes\u201d of <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MzAwLDE4NzI2XQ==\">Isaiah 33:20; Isaiah 54:2<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\">Judges 4:21<\/a>, or, as in <a class=\"ref\">Ezekiel 15:3<\/a>, for a nail driven into the wall. Here the context shows that the latter meaning is preferable. It was, as the sequel shows, a symbol of the support upon which others can depend. (Comp. the \u201cnail in his holy place\u201d of <a class=\"ref\">Ezra 9:8<\/a>.) <\/p>\n <p>He shall be for a glorious throne . . .\u2014Another symbol of sovereignty follows. The form, throne of glory, is found in its highest application in <a class=\"ref\">1 Samuel 2:8<\/a>, and <a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 14:21; Jeremiah 17:12<\/a>. Such a throne, kingly in its state, is to be the pride of the hitherto obscure house of Eliakim. <\/p>",
