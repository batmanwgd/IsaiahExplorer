We have here the third great evil, on account of which divine vengeance was about to come upon them; namely, the power of reigning and barefaced impiety; the punishment whereof, denounced in the subsequent verses, is, as usual, assimilated to the vice, namely, destructive factions, which should overthrow their republic. Having rendered themselves hateful to God by their crimes, they shall be destroyed by those crimes, by their dissensions, animosities, divisions, tumults, insurrections, and civil broils, arising from the wickedness of their own dispositions, and issuing in their mutual destruction. Inflamed by envy, avarice, and impurity, they shall perish in this very fire let loose among them by the wrath of God, and permitted to rage uncontrolled, like fire among briers and thorns, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODQ5XQ==\">Isaiah 9:19<\/a>. The latter state of the Israelitish government abundantly proves the exactness of this prophet\u2019s prediction, <a class=\"ref\">2 Kings 15:10; 2 Kings 15:30; 2 Kings 17:1; 2 Kings 17:18-24<\/a>.<\/p>",
