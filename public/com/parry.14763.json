Little is known of Zechariah, other than that he was the son of Jeberechiah and was considered to be a <i>faithful witness.<\/i> He may have been the same Zechariah who was King Ahaz's father-in-law and the grandfather of King Hezekiah. The fact that Isaiah would have two witnesses, as required by law (<a class=\"ref\">Deut. 17:6; 19:15<\/a>), to the inscription of his son's name on a tablet indicates that he wanted the public to know that the Lord had indeed fulfilled the sign given in 7:14-16. The two witnesses could later testify that Isaiah himself had inscribed the tablet and could confirm the date of inscription.<\/p> ",
