    "html": "<p><i>For his princes were in Zoan. <\/i>The Prophet not only says that the aid of the Egyptians was sought, and that they were invited to assist, but expresses something more, namely, that the Jews obtained it with great labor and expense. They had to perform long and painful journeys, to endure much toil, and to expend vast sums of money, in order to arrive, loaded with presents, at the most distant cities of Egypt, which are here named by the Prophet. On this embassy were sent, not persons of mean or ordinary rank, but \u201cprinces\u201d and nobles; and therefore the censure was more severe, because they slavishly solicited an alliance with Egypt, and wandered like suppliants through various countries. It is proper also to bear in mind the contrast which we have already pointed out. They did not need to go far to seek God; they did not need to endure much toil, or spend large sums of money, in calling on him. He invited them by his promise, \u201cThis is my rest,\u201d and assured them that in that place they would not call upon him in vain. (<a class=\"ref\">Psalms 132:14<\/a>; <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTgxNzc=\">Isaiah 28:12<\/a>.) But those wretched persons despised God, and chose rather to torment themselves, and to run to the very ends of the world, than to receive the assistance which was offered to them. <\/p>",
