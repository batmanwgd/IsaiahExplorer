    "html": " <i>Judgment&hellip;will I lay to the line, and righteousness to the plummet. <\/i>The verse is directly related to 28:16, wherein Isaiah uses imagery related to building practices. Stonemasons use a measuring line and plumb bob (plummet) to ensure a proper fit in the structure. Here Isaiah likens these tools to <i>judgment<\/i> and <i>righteousness,<\/i> and by these the Lord will evaluate and measure his people. If the stones do not measure up to these standards, they will be set aside (1:21). A firmly established building with righteous dwellers will survive sweeping hail and overflowing waters.<\/p> <p>Joseph Smith referred to this verse: \"The world has had a fair trial for six thousand years; the Lord will try the seventh thousand Himself; 'He whose right it is, will possess the kingdom, and reign until He has put all things under His feet'; iniquity will hide its hoary head, Satan will be bound, and the works of darkness destroyed; righteousness will be put to the line, and judgment to the plummet, and 'he that fears the Lord will alone be exalted in that day.'\" <\/p> <p> <i>hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies. <\/i>Hail and waters are used here as figures of divine judgment (28:2; <a class=\"ref\">Mosiah 12:6<\/a>), which will sweep away the refuge and hiding place of the wicked. The same judgments, however, will not harm the righteous, for they have been carefully built with a measuring line and plumb bob.<\/p> ",
