    "html": "<p>Chapter 40 begins the second part of Isaiah&rsquo;s linear literary structure Trouble at Home ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 1-39<\/a>), Exile Abroad ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 40-54<\/a>), and Happy Homecoming ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 55-66<\/a>), which has antecedents in early Egyptian narrative patterns. Chapter 40 additionally forms an integral part of Part II of Isaiah&rsquo;s synchronous Seven-Part Structure ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODQyOV0seyIxODMzMiI6MTIxfV0=\">Isaiah 6-8; 36-40<\/a>) that transposes the entire Book of Isaiah into an allegory or series of historical types of an end-time scenario. A total of seven layered literary structures preclude the idea many scholars espouse that the Book of Isaiah was written by more than one author.<\/p><p>When a people&rsquo;s &ldquo;sins&rdquo; or &ldquo;transgressions&rdquo; (<em>hatta&rsquo;im<\/em>) beget covenant curses, especially over successive generations, they must endure Jehovah&rsquo;s justice until they repent. But even when they repent, the evil effects of former transgressions&mdash;the curses of the covenant&mdash;aren&rsquo;t immediately removed. We observe this in the land&rsquo;s invasion by the king of Assyria ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 36-37<\/a>)&mdash;Jehovah&rsquo;s<em>hand<\/em> of punishment&mdash;a curse that accrued from the transgressions of King Ahaz and his people ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc4MDAiOjR9LHsiMTc4MTQiOjN9XQ==\">Isaiah 7:17-20; 8:6-8<\/a>). But there comes a time&mdash;when his people patiently endure the curses&mdash;that Jehovah reverses them.<\/p><p>As in the term of a pregnancy&mdash;after which comes deliverance&mdash;Jehovah commissions Isaiah to proclaim his people&rsquo;s &ldquo;guilt&rdquo; or &ldquo;iniquity&rdquo; (<em>&lsquo;awon<\/em>) &ldquo;expiated&rdquo; (<em>nirsa<\/em>). That happy news coincides with their ascending from the Jacob\/Israel to the Zion\/Jerusalem category and levels higher upon passing his test of their loyalty ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4Mzc1XQ==\">Isaiah 37:22<\/a>). It also sequentially parallels the seraph&rsquo;s declaring Isaiah&rsquo;s iniquity removed at the time Jehovah appoints him as a prophet ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3Nzc3XQ==\">Isaiah 6:7<\/a>). Accordingly, Isaiah now assumes the role of a seraph who sits in Jehovah&rsquo;s heavenly council ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODQyNCI6NH0=\">vv 3-6<\/a>), implying that he too has ascended.<\/p> ",
