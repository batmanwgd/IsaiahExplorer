In this verse \"the stay and staff\" are also identified as bread and water, both as food and drink and as a metaphor for the teachings and spiritual blessings of the gospel.  <\/p>  <p>  <b>2 Nephi 13:2\u20133. They went thatta way.<\/b> The Babylonians not only conquered the land, but the invading armies also took captive and led away the most influential and powerful people, thereby reducing the threat of a future revolt.  <\/p>  <p>  <b>2 Nephi 13:4\u20135. \"Babes shall rule over them\"<\/b> Only the young or inexperienced will be left in Judah to rule. Seven of the kings who ruled over Judah during the time of Isaiah up to the Babylonian captivity were between the ages of eight and twenty-five when they began their reigns, and all but one are characterized as \"evil\" in the Old Testament account (see Nyman, <i>Great Are the Words of Isaiah,<\/i> 35). Under these circumstances, neighbors will oppress one another, and the young will lose respect for their elders.  <\/p>  <p>  <b>2 Nephi 13:6\u20137. \"Thou hast clothing, be thou our ruler\"<\/b> You know you're in trouble when simply having clothes makes you a candidate for public office.  <\/p>  <p>  <b>2 Nephi 13:8. \"Their tongues and their doings\" <\/b>An interesting way of characterizing their words and their actions, both of which \"provoke the eyes of his glory,\" or in other words, defy the work and glory of the Lord, which is to bring to pass their eternal life (see Moses 1:39).  <\/p>  ",
