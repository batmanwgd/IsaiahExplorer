Let him make it known, and show it to me; since I founded the people of ancient time! And future things, and what is approaching, let them only make known.\u201d<\/i>, Jehovah shows Himself as the God of prophecy since the time that He founded <span class=\"normal hebrew\">,\u05e2\u05dd\u05be\u05e2\u05d5\u05dc\u05dd<\/span>,(<span class=\"normal hebrew\">,\u05d9\u05e7\u05e8\u05d0<\/span>, refers to the continued preaching of prophecy). <i>(<span class=\"translit\">,\u201bAm <\/span>) is the epithet applied in <a class=\"ref\">Ezekiel 26:20<\/a>, to the people of the dead, who are sleeping the long sleep of the grave; and here it does not refer to Israel, which could neither be called an \u201ceternal\u201d nation, nor a people of the olden time, and which would have been more directly named; but according to <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDI4XQ==\">Isaiah 40:7<\/a>, and <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDg2XQ==\">Isaiah 42:5<\/a>, where (<span class=\"translit\">,\u201bam <\/span>) signifies the human race, and <a class=\"ref\">Job 22:15<\/a>., where (<span class=\"translit\">,\u201bo\u0304la\u0302m <\/span>) is the time of the old world before the flood, it signifies humanity as existing from the very earliest times. The prophecies of Jehovah reach back even to the history of paradise. The parenthetical clause, \u201cLet him speak it out, and tell it me,\u201d is like the apodosis of a hypothetical protasis: \u201cif any one thinks that he can stand by my side.\u201d The challenge points to earlier prophecies; with <span class=\"normal hebrew\">,\u05d5\u05d0\u05ea\ufb39\u05d5\u05ea<\/span>, it takes a turn to what is future, <span class=\"normal hebrew\">,\u05d0\u05ea\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea<\/span>, itself denoting what is absolutely future, according to <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDc1XQ==\">Isaiah 41:23<\/a>, and <span class=\"normal hebrew\">,\ufb4a\u05d1\u05d0\u05e0\u05d4 <\/span> <span class=\"normal hebrew\">,\u05d0\u05e9\u05c1\u05e8<\/span>, what is about to be realized immediately; (<span class=\"translit\">, la\u0302mo\u0304 <\/span>) is an ethical dative. <br> <\/i> <\/p>",
