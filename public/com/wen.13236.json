    "html": "Guide thee\u2014Like a shepherd. And he adds continually to shew that his conduct and blessing shall not be momentary, or of a short continuance, but all along as it was to Israel in the wilderness. Satisfy\u2014Thou shalt have plenty, when others are in scarcity. Make fat\u2014This may be spoken in opposition to the sad effects of famine, whereby the flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen, and the bones that were not seen, stick out. A garden\u2014If thou relieve the poor, thou shalt never be poor, but as a well\u2014watered garden, always flourishing. Fail not\u2014Heb. deceive not, a metaphor which farther notes also the continuance of this flourishing state, which will not be like a land\u2014flood, or brooks, that will soon be dried up with drought. Thou shalt be fed with a spring of blessing, that will never fail.",
