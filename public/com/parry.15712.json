At the conclusion of the last days, as the Lord ushers in the Millennium, he will bring an end to the fallen condition of the earth. He will renew the earth and restore it to its Edenic state. The Lord will dwell among his people.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>As the events of the last days unfold, the Lord assures us that if we are righteous, we need not fear the works of man. The Lord is greater than any man, and he will help us. He reminds us of his works of power in times past; by that same power he will bring Zion and fulfill all his promises to her.<\/i><\/p> ",
