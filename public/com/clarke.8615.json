This verse expresses the relief afforded to them, fainting with heat in their journey through that hot country, destitute of shelter, by causing shady trees, and those of the tallest and most beautiful kinds, to spring up for their defense. The apocryphal Baruch, speaking of the return from Babylon, expresses God's protection of his people by the same image: \"Even the woods and every sweet-smelling tree shall overshadow Israel by the commandment of God.\" 5:8.<\/p> \n\n<p><em>The oil tree\u2014<\/em> This, Kimchi says, is not to be understood of the olive tree, for the olive is distinguished, <a class=\"ref\">Nehemiah 8:15<\/a>; but it means the pine or fir, from which pitch is extracted.<\/p> ",
