    "html": "<p>Isaiah describes the complete destruction of the wicked Israelites who refuse to turn to the merciful hand of the Lord. He explains that the &ldquo;head&rdquo; (the king and other leaders) is leading the Israelites in their wickedness. Isaiah then mockingly describes the false prophets (apostate priests and teachers) as the &ldquo;tail&rdquo; of the people, representing the lowest and most despicable of sinners (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODQ1XQ==\">v. 15<\/a>). We can relate this scripture to the wickedness of our own society today. Many of our political and business leaders set poor examples of moral behavior and integrity. Also, numerous religious and social leaders try to turn us away from the truth. By the power of the Holy Spirit, we can determine if we are being led astray. As we follow the words of God&rsquo;s prophets, we will stay on the path to truth.<\/p>\r\n<p>Isaiah teaches us that, because of their completely wicked state, the children of Israel would not receive the mercy of the Lord, and they would become so wicked that they would ignore even the fatherless and widowed. Isaiah then repeats his twofold promise that the Lord&rsquo;s &ldquo;anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODQ3XQ==\">v. 17<\/a>) again suggesting that the Lord will destroy those who are unrighteous but have mercy on those who return to Him.<\/p>",
