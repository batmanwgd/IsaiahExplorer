The words may be properly rendered, <i>Thou, O Elam, that dealest treacherously with the treacherous dealer,<\/i> or, <i>that oppressest the oppressor, and spoilest the spoiler, go up, besiege,<\/i> &c. Babylon had long oppressed and ravaged other countries: and it was now her turn to be oppressed and ravaged. Elam was an eminent province of Persia, bordering upon Media, and is here put for Persia in general. God here gives the Medes and Persians their commission to go up and take Babylon, and thereby to put an end to the sighs and groans of the captive Jews, and of other nations held in bondage, and oppressed by that tyrannical and cruel empire.<\/p> ",
