He speaks to the countries by a prosopop\u0153ia. <i>Bring my sons from far <\/i>\u2014 Not only permit, but assist and further their return. <i>Every one that is called <\/i>\u2014 Rather, <i>every one is called, <\/i>or, <i>they are all called, by my name <\/i>\u2014 I own them for my people and children; and, therefore, what kindness or cruelty you exercise toward them, I take it as done to myself. <i>I have created him for my glory <\/i>\u2014 And therefore I will glorify my power, and goodness, and faithfulness in delivering them. <i>I have formed him <\/i>\u2014 I have not only <i>created <\/i>them out of nothing, but I have also <i>formed <\/i>and <i>made <\/i>them my peculiar people. We must observe, however, that while Isaiah \u201cappears to speak of one thing only, two are understood: the less includes the greater. Speaking literally and properly of the collection of the dispersed church from Babylon, \u2014 a more noble collection, the spiritual one, of the converted Jews and Gentiles to the church of Christ, was in his view; and this is described in expressions taken from the external collection of the church from Babylon, and the restoration of the republic under the Maccabees; exactly in the same manner as in chap. 11:12, which should be compared with this place. The 7th verse plainly shows that the spiritual seed of Israel is spoken of. <i>Every one that is called by my name, <\/i>means, every one who is truly my son; for to be <i>called by the name <\/i>of any one is to be his son.\u201d See chap. 45:5, and Vitringa.<\/p>",
