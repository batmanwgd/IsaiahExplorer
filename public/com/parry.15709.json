    "html": " <p>Two classes of people are contrasted in these two verses. One class consists of those who fear the Lord and obey his servant (50:10). They will not walk in spiritual darkness but will have spiritual light (50:10). The other class consists of those who seek to be spiritually self-sufficient, relying on themselves instead of on God. They attempt to create their own light (50:11), but their efforts produce no more than sparks (50:11) when compared to the bright light that comes from God. Those in this group will eventually receive judgments from the Lord, resulting in sorrow (50:11).<\/p> <blockquote> <i>Who<\/i> is among you that <u>feareth the Lord<\/u>,     <br><i>that<\/i> <u>obeyeth the voice of his servant<\/u>,     <br>that walketh in <i>darkness,<\/i>     <br>and hath<i> no light?
