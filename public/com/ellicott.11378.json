The inscriptions of the Assyrian king are full of like boasts. Shalmaneser, \u201cTrackless paths and difficult mountains . . .

Possibly the words had become a kind of proverb for surmounting obstacles. Lebanon and Carmel are joined together, as in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 33:9<\/a>.<\/p>",
