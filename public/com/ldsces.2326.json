Because it was his home, and therefore the place where he received his visions and revelations, it is not surprising that he would call it the place of vision. <\/p> <p>After making it clear that the enemies of Israel would not go unpunished by revealing the various &ldquo;burdens&rdquo; upon them (see <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MDc0XQ==\">Isaiah 13&ndash;21 <\/a>), the Lord had Isaiah return to the theme he was developing before&mdash;that Israel and Judah faced the judgments of God.
