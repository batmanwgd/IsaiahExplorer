Bishop Lowth renders it, \u201cThe pointing of the finger, and the injurious speech.\u201d <i>If thou draw out <\/i>\u2014Open, as when we open a store to satisfy the wants of the needy; <i>thy soul to the hungry <\/i>\u2014Thy affection, that is, thy pity and compassion, to those in want of the necessaries of life; <i>and satisfy the afflicted soul <\/i>\u2014With a real, substantial benefit, not contenting thyself with giving him merely kind words. For here the prophet expresses the work that is to be done, as in the former clause the affection wherewith it is to be done; otherwise it would only be what the Apostle James reproves, <a class=\"ref\">James 2:15-16<\/a>. <i>Then shall thy light rise in obscurity <\/i>\u2014See on <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4Nzk1XQ==\">Isaiah 58:8<\/a>; <i>and thy darkness be as the noon-day <\/i>\u2014In the very darkness of the affliction itself, thou shalt have comfort, <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 112:4<\/a>. There it shall be as the morning, still increasing, here as the noon-day, in its zenith, and height of perfection. <\/p>",
