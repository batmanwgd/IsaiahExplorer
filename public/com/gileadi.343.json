    "html": "<p>When Assyria threatens the world with destruction, the earth&rsquo;s inhabitants&mdash;many of them Jehovah&rsquo;s people&mdash;rely on Egypt, the world&rsquo;s great superpower, to save them. Egypt&rsquo;s military may be strong enough to withstand Assyria, but its protection is merely a human substitute. To show that he alone can deliver his people, Jehovah will permit Assyria to ravage Egypt. If they will inquire of Jehovah&rsquo;s <em>mouth<\/em>&mdash;his servant&mdash;however, they will know that Jehovah protects those who rely on him: &ldquo;I will put my words in your <em>mouth<\/em> and shelter you in the shadow of my <em>hand<\/em>&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 51:16<\/a>; emphasis added).<\/p>",
