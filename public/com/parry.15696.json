We are separated from God, but Isaiah promises that there is One who has the power of reconciliation. This restoration to a union with God is made possible by the atonement of Jesus Christ, who submitted himself to shame and pain, both physical and emotional, so that he could bless us. If we will fear the Lord and obey his servants, we will have his light.<\/i><\/p> ",
