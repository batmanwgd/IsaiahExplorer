Thus, in places where there were no waters at all, and it might have been supposed that his army would inevitably perish, there he had dug them (<em> qu\u0304r <\/em> , from which <em> m a\u0302qo\u0304r <\/em> is derived, <em> fodere <\/em> ; not <em> scaturire <\/em> , as Luzzatto supposes), and had drunk up these waters, which had been called up, as if by magic, upon foreign soil; and in places where there were waters, as in Egypt (<em> m a\u0302tso\u0304r <\/em> is used in Isaiah and Micah for <em> mitsrayim <\/em> , with a play upon the appellative meaning of the word: an enclosing fence, a fortifying girdle: see <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 31:22<\/a>), the Nile-arms and canals of which appeared to bar all farther progress, it was an easy thing for him to set at nought all these opposing hindrances. The Nile, with its many arms, was nothing but a puddle to him, which he trampled out with his feet.<\/p>",
