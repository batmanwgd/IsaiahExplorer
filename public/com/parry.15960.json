This statement also reminds us of Paul's expression that we belong to God, having been bought with a price (<a class=\"ref\">1 Cor. 6:19-20<\/a>). <\/p> <p> <i>thou never barest rule over them\/not called by thy name.<\/i> Isaiah here sets up a difference between the chosen, covenant people, and their adversaries. The true people of God have been known to him by covenant; they have subjected themselves to him. Others have refused to humble themselves and receive the Lord as their God and their king. Through covenant and submissiveness, a people can become the Lord's people\u2014\"we are thine\"\u2014and, in turn, lay claim to his blessings.<\/p> ",
