It is supposed to be the name of a place, so called from some eminent house or temple of their idols which was in it; <i>and to Dibon <\/i>\u2014 Another city of Moab; <i>to weep<\/i> \u2014 To offer their supplications with tears to their idols for help. <i>Moab shall howl over Nebo and Medeba <\/i>\u2014 Two considerable cities anciently belonging to the Moabites, from whom they were taken by the Amorites, and from them by the Israelites; but were, it seems, recovered by the Moabites, in whose hands they now were. \u201cThe prophet so orders his discourse in this prophecy, as if, being placed on a high mountain, he beheld the army of the Assyrians, suddenly, and contrary to all expectation, directing their course toward Moab; and in this unforeseen attack, ravaging and plundering, rather than besieging, the principal cities and fortifications of this country; while the Moabites, astonished at the report of this event, burst forth into weeping and lamentation, hasten to the temples and altars of their god Chemosh, to implore his aid, making bare their heads, cutting off their hair, and filling all places with howling and lamentation, like desperate men; while some of them fall by the sword of the enemy, some of them flee toward Arabia, their goods, land, vineyards, &c., being left a spoil to the enemy.\u201d See Vitringa.<\/p>",
