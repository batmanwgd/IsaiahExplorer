They would be left to grovel and stumble in spiritual darkness. The heavens and the voices of the prophets are silent to those whose ears will not hear. This is descriptive of the apostate condition that prevailed at the time young Joseph Smith sought for the truth. In response to his prayerful plea, and as foreordained in the premortal councils before this world was, the heavens were once again opened and the spiritual eyes and ears of the young Prophet Joseph were touched.<\/p>",
