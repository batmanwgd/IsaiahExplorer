    "html": "<p><em>I am sought of them that asked not for me<\/em>&mdash;That is, by the Gentiles. So Paul applies it in <a class=\"ref\">Romans 10:20<\/a>. Lowth translates the word which is rendered, &lsquo;I am sought,&rsquo; by &lsquo;I am made known.&rsquo; Noyes, &lsquo;I have heard.&rsquo; The Septuagint renders it, &Epsilon;\u0313&mu;&phi;&alpha;&nu;&eta;\u0300&sigmaf; &epsilon;\u0313&gamma;&epsilon;&nu;&eta;\u0301&theta;&eta;&nu; Emphane\u0304s egene\u0304the\u0304n&mdash;&lsquo;I became manifest.&rsquo; Jerome, &lsquo;They sought me who had not before inquired for me.&rsquo; The Chaldee, &lsquo;I am sought in my word by those who had not asked me before my face.&rsquo; The Hebrew word \u05d3\u05e8\u05e9\u05c1 da\u0302rash means properly &ldquo;to frequent a place, to search or seek&rdquo;; and in the Niphal&mdash;the form used here&mdash;&ldquo;to be sought unto, to grant access to anyone; hence, to hear and answer prayer&rdquo; <a class=\"ref\">Ezekiel 14:3; Ezekiel 20:3-31<\/a>. Here there is not only the idea that he was sought, but that they obtained access to him, for he listened to their supplications. The phrase, &lsquo;That asked not for me,&rsquo; means that they had not been accustomed to worship the true God. The idea is, that those had obtained mercy who had not been accustomed to call upon him.<\/p><p><em>I am found of them<\/em>&mdash;Paul has rendered this <a class=\"ref\">Romans 10:20<\/a>, &Epsilon;\u0313&mu;&phi;&alpha;&nu;&eta;\u0300&sigmaf; &epsilon;\u0313&gamma;&epsilon;&nu;&omicron;\u0301&mu;&eta;&nu; Emphane\u0304s egenome\u0304n&mdash;&lsquo;I was made manifest.&rsquo; The idea is, that they obtained his favor.<\/p><p><em>I said, Behold me, behold me<\/em>&mdash;I offered them my favor, and invited them to partake of salvation. Paul has omitted this in his quotation.<\/p><p><em>Unto a nation<\/em>&mdash;This does not refer to any particular nation, but to people who had never been admitted to favor with God.<\/p><p><em>That was not called by my name<\/em>&mdash;(See the notes at <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 63:19<\/a>).<\/p>",
