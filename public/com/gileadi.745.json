    "html": "<p>The new heavens and new earth Jehovah makes that characterize his millennial age of peace transform the earth&rsquo;s surface that is reduced to chaos in Jehovah&rsquo;s Day of Judgment (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxNzg3NCwxODA5N10seyIxODExNSI6Mn0sWzE4MTg3XV0=\">Isaiah 10:23; 24:1, 19-20; 28:22<\/a>) and alter its configuration of stars (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3OTIwLDE4MzA4LDE4Njg3LDE4NjkwXQ==\">Isaiah 13:13; 34:4; 51:13, 16<\/a>). Jehovah re-creates the heavens and the earth at the same time that he re-creates his elect: &ldquo;See, I create new heavens and a new earth; former events shall not be remembered or recalled to mind. Rejoice, then, and be glad forever in what I create. See, I create Jerusalem to be a delight and its people a joy&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODkxNSI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 65:17-18<\/a>).<\/p><p>Under the terms of the Abrahamic Covenant, Jehovah blesses unconditionally with descendants as many as the stars in the heavens and sands of the sea all who ascend to the spiritual level of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (cf.<a class=\"ref\">Genesis 22:17; 26:4, 24; 32:12; Exodus 32:13<\/a> ;<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDQ3LDE4NjM0XQ==\">Isaiah 40:26; 48:19<\/a>). Persons who attain their stature, Jehovah gives &ldquo;a handclasp and a name,&rdquo; endowing them with &ldquo;an everlasting name that shall not be cut off&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzU5XQ==\">Isaiah 56:5<\/a> ; cf.<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODE5LDE4ODU3LDE4OTEzXQ==\">8:11; 62:2; 65:15<\/a> ;<a class=\"ref\">Genesis 17:5-7, Genesis 17:5-7, 15; 32:28; 32:28<\/a>). Jehovah&rsquo;s covenants thus point to his people&rsquo;s ultimately inheriting the blessings of their righteous progenitors.<\/p> ",
