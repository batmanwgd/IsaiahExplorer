    "html": "<p>This chapter begins with a denunciation of the approaching ruin of the Israelites by Shalmaneser, whose power is compared to a tempest or flood, and his keenness to the avidity with which one plucks and swallows the grape that is soonest ripe,  <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 28:1-4<\/a>. It then turns to the two tribes of Judah and Benjamin, who were to continue a kingdom after the final captivity of their brethren; and gives first a favorable prognostication of their affairs under Hezekiah,  <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 28:5<\/a>,  <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 28:6<\/a>; but soon changes to reproofs and threatenings for their intemperance and their profaneness,  <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 28:7<\/a>,  <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 28:8<\/a>. They are introduced as not only scornfully rejecting, but also mocking and ridiculing, the instructions of the prophet,  <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 28:9<\/a>,  <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 28:10<\/a>. To this God immediately retorts in terms alluding to their own mocking, but differently applied,  <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 28:11-13<\/a>. The prophet then addresses these scoffers,  <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 28:14<\/a>; who considered themselves as perfectly secure from every evil,  <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 28:15<\/a>; and assures them that there was no method under heaven but one, by which they could be saved,  <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 28:16<\/a>; that every other vain resource should fail in the day of visitation,  <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 28:17<\/a>,  <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 28:18<\/a>. He then farther adds, that the judgments of God were particularly levelled against them; and that all the means to which they trusted for warding them off should be to no purpose,  <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 28:19<\/a>,  <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 28:20<\/a>; as the Almighty, who, on account of his patience and long-suffering, is amiably described as unacquainted with punishing, had nevertheless determined to punish them,  <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 28:21<\/a>,  <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 28:22<\/a>. The prophet then concludes with a beautiful parable in explanation and defense of God's dealing with his people,  <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 28:23-29<\/a>.<\/p>",
