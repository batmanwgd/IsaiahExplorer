    "html": "<p> The sixth woe: <em> \u201cWoe to those who are heroes to drink wine, and brave men to mix strong drink; who acquit criminals for a bribe, and take away from every one the righteousness of the righteous.\u201d<\/em> We see from <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzYzXQ==\">Isaiah 5:23<\/a> that the drinkers in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzYyXQ==\">Isaiah 5:22<\/a> are unjust judges. The threat denounced against these is Isaiah's universal ceterum censeo; and accordingly it forms, in this instance also, the substance of his sixth and last woe. They are heroes; not, however, in avenging wrong, but in drinking wine; they are men of renown, though not for deciding between guilt and innocence, but for mixing up the ingredients of strong artistic wines. For the terms applied to such mixed wines, see <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 75:9; Proverbs 23:30, Song of Solomon 7:3<\/a>. It must be borne in mind, however, that what is here called <em> sheca\u0302r <\/em> was not, properly speaking, wine, but an artificial mixture, like date wine and cider. For such things as these they were noteworthy and strong; whereas they judged unjustly, and took bribes that they might consume the reward of their injustice in drink and debauchery (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgxNzIiOjJ9LFsxNzI5MF1d\">Isaiah 28:7-8; Proverbs 31:5<\/a>). \u201cFor reward:\u201d <em> e\u0304keb <\/em> (Arab. <em> \u201bukb <\/em> ; different from <em> a\u0302ke\u0304b <\/em> , a heel, = <em> \u201bakib <\/em> ) is an adverbial accusative, \u201cin recompense,\u201d or \u201cfor pay.\u201d \u201c<em> From him<\/em> \u201d (<em> mimmennu <\/em> ) is distributive, and refers back to <em> tsaddikim <\/em> (the righteous); as, for example, in <a class=\"ref\">Hosea 4:8<\/a>.<\/p>",
