    "html": "<p><b>(<a class=\"ref\">2 Nephi 24:29<\/a>).<\/b>\"<i>Out of the serpent's root shall come forth a cockatrice, and his fruit shall be a fiery flying serpent.<\/i>\" Although Philistia shall see the death of one or more enemies as the means of deliverance from oppression, yet worse dangers (out of the serpent's root) are to come. Sidney Sperry points out the <i>serpent's root,cockatrice<\/i>(venomous viper), and <i>fiery flying serpent<\/i> are \"all symbolic of evil to come upon her [Philistia].\" (BMC, 245.) Each of these represents a more deadly threat than the previous one mentioned. J. R. Dummelow identified Sargon (Assyrian king from 722 to 705 b.c.) and Sennacherib (Assyrian king from 705 to 681 b.c.) as the cockatrice and fiery serpent, \"each one proving more terrible and formidable to the nations of Western Asia than his predecessor.\" (TOVBC, 426.)<\/p>",
