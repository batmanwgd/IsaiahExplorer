These suffer the curse of servitude to the Assyrian archtyrant, who here appears under his religious or cultic title &ldquo;king of Babylon&rdquo; in the pattern of ancient Assyrian conquerors of Babylon. In this parody of a lament&mdash;beginning with the word &ldquo;How&rdquo; (cf. <a class=\"ref\">Lamentations 1:1<\/a>)&mdash;those who survive his servitude launch into a &ldquo;taunt,&rdquo; glad to see the end of him and his tyranny.<\/p> ",
