The expression means that the people have turned from the right way of worship.<\/p> <p><i>burneth incense.<\/i> The verb used here means \"to make to smoke\" and can be used in describing all burnt offerings, not just offerings of incense (<a class=\"ref\">Jer. 44:3-5<\/a>). <\/p> <p><i>altars of brick.<\/i> According to the law of Moses, incense was to be burned only on altars of unhewn stone (<a class=\"ref\">Ex. 20:24-25; Deut. 27:5<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\">Josh. 8:31<\/a>). Burnt offerings to pagan gods may have been made on rooftops or in the streets (<a class=\"ref\">Jer. 19:13; 32:29<\/a>), or in the case of incense offerings, bricks may have been heated and then incense sprinkled on the bricks. <\/p> ",
