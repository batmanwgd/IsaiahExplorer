The meaning is, that he will remove every obstacle and hinderance that might prevent the return of the people; and that he will render the \u201cmountains\u201d passable, which appeared to be impassable; and, in short, that he will level both the mountains and the valleys, that their return to Judea may be facilitated. Thus, when the Church is about to be completely restored, no obstructions, however great and formidable, can hinder God from being finally victorious. Besides, when he calls them \u201cmy mountains,\u201d he not only means that he has an absolute right to command them to afford a passage to his people, but declares that he will be the leader of the expedition, as if he would march along with the Jews, and accompany them in the joumey. In like manner, it is said in another passage, that he passed through Egypt and \u201crode on the high places of it\u201d at the departure of his people. (<a class=\"ref\">Deuteronomy 32:13<\/a> .) But here he describes the extraordinary love of God towards the Church, when he says that he travels along with her, and undertakes to supply all her wants, as if he were consulting his own interests when he assisted his people.<\/p> ",
