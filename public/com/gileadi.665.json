That pattern is of the archtyrant&mdash;the <em>lips<\/em> that speak guile and the <em>tongue<\/em> that utters duplicity. It is not of Jehovah&rsquo;s servant, who exemplifies <em>righteousness<\/em> and is forthright of speech (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NTgxXQ==\">Isaiah 45:19<\/a>). By now, Jehovah&rsquo;s alienated people have decided which exemplar they want to emulate, with inevitable consequences to follow (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg4MTAiOjN9LHsiMTg4ODUiOjJ9XQ==\">vv 9-11; Isaiah 63:18-19<\/a>).<\/p><p>The &ldquo;empty words deceitfully spoken&rdquo; that Jehovah&rsquo;s apostate people rely on, and the &ldquo;misdeeds&rdquo; or &ldquo;oppression&rdquo; (<em>&lsquo;amal<\/em>) they conceive in their hearts, have become so habitual that their entire lives are compromised by evil: &ldquo;The godless utter blasphemy; their heart ponders impiety: how to practice hypocrisy and preach perverse things concerning Jehovah, leaving the hungry soul empty, depriving the thirsty [soul] of drink. And rogues scheme by malevolent means and insidious devices to ruin the poor, and with false slogans and accusations to denounce the needy&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODI2NiI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 32:6-7<\/a>; cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MjA5XQ==\">29:15<\/a>).<\/p>",
