    "html": "          <p>The warning in verses 1 through 7 is here extended to our day by the Lord's commanding Isaiah to record it as a witness for the latter days (verse 8); a marginal note in the KJV specifically identifies \"the latter day.\" Judah had rebelled against the law of the Lord and would listen only to the false prophets who taught what she wanted to hear. This same condition existed among the Nephites at the time Samuel the Lamenite came among them (see <a class=\"ref\">Hel. 13:25-28<\/a>). Because of this rebellion and rejection of the prophets, a purging was going to come until only a small number of them would be left to become as \"a beacon upon the top of a mountain\" or \"an ensign on a hill.\" Elder Marion D. Hanks quoted verses 9 and 10 as a warning to those who, in pride or arrogance, think they do not need God or his Christ (see CR, Apr. 1972, p. 127). Elder Thomas S. Monson referred to verse 17 when speaking of the name of the new Ensign magazine which was to begin publication in 1971; he referred to the significance which Isaiah had given to the term \"ensign\" (see CR, Oct. 1970, p. 105; see also <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzY2LDE3ODk1LDE3ODk3LDE4MjYwXQ==\">Isaiah 5:26; 11:10, 12; 31:9<\/a>).<\/p>     ",
