It is the people who are at fault, obstinately refusing to respond to the divine requests. Another aspect of one's inability to understand the word of the Lord is lack of spiritual depth. Some simply do not have the spiritual maturity to recognize the light that is available. The Savior referenced this passage in Isaiah during His mortal ministry. (See JST Matthew 13:12-15; <a class=\"ref\">Luke 8:10<\/a>.)<\/p>",
