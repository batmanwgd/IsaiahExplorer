The structure was called <i>house of the forest<\/i> because it was constructed of cedar columns and beams, and it housed armor and other items (<a class=\"ref\">1 Kgs. 7:2-5; 10:17<\/a>). Isaiah's inspired words show irony in the situation: the Jews prepared for the coming war by trusting in their armories, including the house of the forest, but they ignored the most significant building on the very same mount: Solomon's temple\u2014the only place from which both temporal and spiritual salvation could have come.<\/p> ",
