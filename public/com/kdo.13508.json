    "html": "<p>Their whole nature is broken up into discord. <i>\u201cThe way of peace they know not, and there is no right in their roads: they make their paths crooked: every one who treads upon them knows no peace.\u201d<\/i> With <span class=\"normal hebrew\">\ufb33\u05e8\u05da<\/span>, the way upon which a man goes, the prophet uses interchangeably (here and in <a class=\"ref\"><\/a>) <span class=\"normal hebrew\">\u05de\u05e1\ufb3c\u05d4<\/span>, a high-road thrown up with an embankment; <span class=\"normal hebrew\">\u05de\u05e2\ufb32\u05dc<\/span> (with the plural in <i>(<span class=\"translit\">\u0131\u0302m<\/span>) and <i>(<span class=\"translit\">o\u0302th<\/span>)), a carriage-road; and <span class=\"normal hebrew\">\u05e0\u05ea\u05d9\u05d1\u05d4<\/span>, a footpath formed by the constant passing to and fro of travellers. Peaceable conduct, springing form a love of peace, and aiming at producing peace, is altogether strange to them; no such thing is to be met with in their path as the recognition of practice of right: they make their paths for themselves (<span class=\"normal hebrew\">\u05dc\u05d4\u05dd<\/span>, dat. ethicus<\/i>), i.e., most diligently, twisting about; and whoever treads upon them ((<span class=\"translit\">ba\u0302h<\/span>), neuter, as in <a class=\"ref\"><\/a>), forfeits all enjoyment of either inward or outward peace. (<span class=\"translit\">Sha\u0302lo\u0304m<\/span>) is repeated significantly, in Isaiah's peculiar style, at the end of the verse. The first strophe of the prophecy closes here: it was from no want of power or willingness on the part of God, that He had not come to the help of His people; the fault lay in their own sins.<br><\/i><\/p>",
