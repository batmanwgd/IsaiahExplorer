When the rest of the cities of the land were taken by the king of Assyria, Zion was preserved, and all that were in it.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Thou shalt weep no more \"Thou shalt implore him with weeping\"\u2014<\/em>The negative particle <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05dc\u05d0 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">lo<\/span>  is not acknowledged by the Septuagint.
