They seek man's approval of that which God has condemned and disdain that which is good. They have been successful in getting legislation passed to make such perversion legal and acceptable by society. Immoral practices are called \"alternate lifestyles\" by those who practice them, and they label those who courageously speak against them as \"radicals\" or \"narrow-minded bigots.\" A prophet of God, President Spencer W. Kimball, declared: \"The fact that some governments and some churches and numerous corrupted individuals have tried to reduce such behavior from criminal offense to personal privilege does not change the nature nor the seriousness of the practice.\" (<i>Ensign,<\/i> November 1980, p. 97; see also BICQ, 38-51.)<\/p>     <p>Others upon whom this woe is pronounced are those who \"lift up the heel against\" the Lord's servants, \"and cry they have sinned when they have not sinned.\" The Lord tells us that those who make such false accusations \"do it because they are the servants of sin, and are the children of disobedience themselves.\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 121:16-17<\/a>.)<\/p>",
