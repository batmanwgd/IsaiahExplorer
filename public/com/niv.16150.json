In effect, he has tried to take the place of the Holy One. The language here has intriguing overtones of several ancient stories about both human and divine hubris, and scholars have expended a good deal of energy seeking for the original poem that the prophet supposedly makes use of. There seems to be a scholarly antipathy to the idea that anything in the Bible could be original. However, the search has not paid off, and it still seems as if Isaiah has taken a number of themes familiar to his hearers and woven them together into a new creation to make his unique theological point.<\/p>     <p>\u2003In verses 13\u201314, the egotist has made four boasts about what he will do: He will rule above even the stars; he will sit on the highest mountaintop, from which the king of the gods rules; he will ascend into the highest heaven (\u201cabove the tops of the clouds\u201d); and he will become equal to God himself. Isaiah recognizes that when we make our own selves the most important thing in our world, we are usurping the rightful place of God. But this man, who thought to make himself equal to God, is mocked by death, which has taken him from the \u201cheights\u201d (v. 13) of his own pretensions to the \u201cdepths of the pit\u201d (v. 15) in one terrible moment.<\/p>     ",
