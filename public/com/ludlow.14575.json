    "title": "The Great Suffering Servant Song",
    "html": " <p>This chapter covers the most noteworthy event in Heavenly Father&rsquo;s plan of salvation&mdash;the mission of Jesus Christ. Isaiah&rsquo;s prophetic description foretells the suffering servant&rsquo;s humble birth, mortal ministry, vicarious suffering, inglorious death, and eternal rewards. Through majestic poetry, Isaiah provides valuable insights about our Savior and His atonement. Almost six centuries later, the prophet Abinadi cites this passage as he teaches King Noah and the wicked priests. Because of the material&rsquo;s doctrinal significance, the following discussion includes inspired commentary from several modern prophets. This profound chapter merits thoughtful study so we can better appreciate the suffering that God&rsquo;s Son endured for us.<\/p> ",
