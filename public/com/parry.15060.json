The people of Judah prepared for the battle by adding to their weapons supply, repairing the city's walls, and so on (22:8-10), but they had not looked to nor had respect for Jehovah, the God of Israel. Judah should have been fasting, praying, worshiping in the temple, and seeking God's word through the mouths of the prophets. Note the terminology Isaiah uses as he explains Judah's reliance on worldly might instead of heavenly powers: during this period of impending battle, Jerusalem's inhabitants did <i>look<\/i> at their armories (22:8), and they <i>have seen<\/i> that their water supply was in order (22:9), but they <i>have not looked<\/i> unto Jehovah, their Maker (22:11).<\/p> <p><i>Maker.<\/i> According to Isaiah's imagery, Jehovah was the Maker (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 30:2; Hosea 8:14<\/a>) of Jerusalem, the great Architect who \"fashioned it long ago.\" Again Isaiah's words are instructive and show contrasts between those who attempted to build Jerusalem through repairs, fortifications, and water channels (22:8-11), and God, who was the city's original builder (22:11).<\/p> ",
