Now bringing forth good fruit, Jehovah&rsquo;s millennial people enjoy an abundance of covenant blessings that spread abroad and touch all creation. With justice and righteousness established throughout the earth, there exists no more cause for enmity among God&rsquo;s creatures.<\/p><p>Ritually clean animals, ones that divide the hoof and chew the cud (<a class=\"ref\">Leviticus 11:3<\/a>)&mdash;&ldquo;lambs,&rdquo; &ldquo;goats,&rdquo; &ldquo;calves,&rdquo; &ldquo;cows,&rdquo; and &ldquo;oxen&rdquo;&mdash;live in harmony with the unclean: &ldquo;wolves,&rdquo; &ldquo;leopards,&rdquo; &ldquo;lions,&rdquo; &ldquo;bears,&rdquo; &ldquo;adders,&rdquo; and &ldquo;vipers&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4OTIzXQ==\">Isaiah 65:25<\/a>). Symbolizing the disharmony that existed on the earth between the natural and assimilated lineages of Jehovah&rsquo;s people and the nations, enmity in the animal kingdom disappears as all creatures become tame. The &ldquo;youngster&rdquo; who &ldquo;leads&rdquo; them symbolizes Jehovah&rsquo;s servant who leads his people in the new exodus (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODQzMiwxODQ5NywxODc5NV0seyIxODg3OCI6NH1d\">Isaiah 40:11; 42:16; 58:8; 63:11-14<\/a>).<\/p>",
