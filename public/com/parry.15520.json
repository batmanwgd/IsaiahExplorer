The gathering of modern Israel calls to mind the exodus from Egypt, and modern Israel will likewise be safely guided through the hardships and dangers of the world.<\/p> <p><i>when thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned. <\/i>This statement refers to the Lord's judgments that fall upon Israel (42:25) and the world (24:6) because of wickedness, with specific application to Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego (<a class=\"ref\">Dan. 3:27<\/a>). It also applies to the last days, when the wicked are destroyed by the burning that will accompany the Lord's coming, while the righteous of Israel remain unscathed.<\/p> ",
