    "html": " <p> <i>Do good, or do evil. <\/i> It must not be supposed that <i>to do evil <\/i> denotes, in this passage, to commit injustice, which is contrary to the nature of God; but it means to inflict punishment, and to send adversity, which ought to be ascribed to the providence of God, and not to idols or fortune. In this sense it is very frequently found in Scripture. <\/p> \n <p> <span> \u201cIs there evil in a city which the Lord hath not done?\u201d \n(<\/span> <a class=\"ref\">Amos 3:6<\/a>.) <\/p> \n <p>In like manner Jeremiah accuses the people of not acknowledging God to be \u201cthe author of good and of evil.\u201d (<a class=\"ref\">Lamentations 3:38<\/a>) By \u201cevils\u201d of that kind, therefore, such as wars, pestilence, famine, poverty, disease, and others of the same kind, the Lord punishes the sins of the people, and wishes to be acknowledged as the author of them all. Now, Isaiah does not bring forward all the examples and arguments by which God could be distinguished from idols, for that would have required a very long discourse; but he is at present satisfied with those which would give a short and yet clear demonstration; for he has not yet concluded his argument. <\/p> ",
