    "html": "<p> The prophet hears a call to war. From whom it issues, and to whom or against whom it is directed, still remains a secret; but this only adds to the intensity.<em> \u201dOn woodless mountain lift ye up a banner, call to them with loud sounding voice, shake the hand, that they may enter into gates of princes!\u201d<\/em> The summons is urgent: hence a threefold signal, viz., the banner-staff planted on a mountain \u201cmade bald\u201d (<em> nishpeh <\/em> , from which comes <em> sh e phi <\/em> , which only occurs in Isaiah and Jeremiah), the voice raised high, and the shaking of the hand, denoting a violent beckoning - all three being favourite signs with Isaiah. The destination of this army is to enter into a city of princes (<em> ned\u0131\u0304b\u0131\u0304m <\/em> , freemen, nobles, princes, <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 107:40<\/a>, cf., <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 113:8<\/a>), namely, to enter as conquerors; for it is not the princes who invite them, but Jehovah.<\/p>",
