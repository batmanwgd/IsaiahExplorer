Fitches (caraway?) and cumin are seeds that can be sown anywhere, because they do not require any special attention to ensure their germination, nor are they as valuable as wheat or other staple grains.<i> <\/i>On the other hand, wheat, a staple food item, is carefully sown in rows so it can easily be covered with soil and thus properly germinate. Barley is sown in well-plowed areas, and rye, a low-yield, coarse-grained crop, is sown around the edges of the field where the earth is not as well cultivated. As the farmer plants many seeds in different conditions, so does the Lord \"plant\" different individuals and groups in different mortal circumstances.<\/p> ",
