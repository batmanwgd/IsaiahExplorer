St. Paul, speaking of the mystery which had been proclaimed among the Gentiles, sums it up in these words:\" which is Christ in You, the hope of glory; whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus;\"  <a class=\"ref\">Colossians 1:27,  Colossians 1:28<\/a>.
