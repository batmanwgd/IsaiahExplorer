    "html": "<p>The theme of a new wandering in the wilderness (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">vv 17-20<\/a>) combines with that of a new conquest (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc4OTYiOjZ9XQ==\">vv 11-16<\/a>) when Jehovah&rsquo;s people return from exile (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc4OTMiOjN9XQ==\">vv 8-10<\/a>). Under those circumstances, sources of water become an important consideration and another test&mdash;as when Moses led Israel through the wilderness following its exodus out of Egypt and the people came to a place with no water : &ldquo;The people thirsted there for water. And the people murmured against Moses and said, &lsquo;Why is it that you have brought us up out of Egypt to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst?&rsquo;&rdquo; (<a class=\"ref\">Exodus 17:3<\/a>).<\/p><p>Jehovah&rsquo;s answer was to demonstrate his power through his servant Moses: &ldquo;&lsquo;Behold, I will stand before you there upon the rock in Horeb. And you will smite the rock and there shall come forth water out of it that the people may drink.&rsquo; And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel&rdquo; (<a class=\"ref\">Exodus 17:6<\/a>). Those who participate in the end-time wandering in the wilderness are the &ldquo;poor and needy,&rdquo; not the rich who don&rsquo;t care for them (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc3MjIiOjJ9LHsiMTc4NTMiOjF9LHsiMTg3OTMiOjJ9XQ==\">Isaiah 3:14-15; 10:2; 58:6-7<\/a>). The <em>tongue<\/em> metaphor alludes to Jehovah&rsquo;s servant who, like Moses, leads their wilderness journey (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg0MzIiOjF9LHsiMTg1MjUiOjJ9LHsiMTg2NDYiOjR9XQ==\">Isaiah 40:11; 43:19-20; 49:9-12<\/a>).<\/p>",
