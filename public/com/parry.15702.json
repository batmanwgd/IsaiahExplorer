His speaking ability is in marked contrast to that of Enoch (<a class=\"ref\">Moses 6:31<\/a>), Moses (Ex. 4:10), and Jeremiah (Jer. 1:6).<\/p> <p><i>speak a word in season.<\/i> The servant delivers the word of the Lord to those he serves. The Lord enables the servant to speak the right words at the right time.<\/p> <p> <i>weary\/waketh morning by morning.<\/i> Though Israel would rather slumber spiritually, the Lord repeatedly awakens her to his word of truth and righteousness. Or the <i>he<\/i> in this verse may refer to the servant rather than the Lord. As a contrasting interpretation, then, the servant speaks to those who are weary because of the burdens of the world, offering daily comfort and blessings. Contrast these verses with <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODE3NiI6Mn0=\">Isa. 28:11-12<\/a>: \"For with stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to this people. To whom he said, This is the rest wherewith ye may cause the weary to rest; and this is the refreshing.\"<\/p> <p><i>waketh mine ear.<\/i> The Lord speaks to the servant's responsive ear in continuing revelation.<\/p> <p><i>hear as the learned.<\/i> Those who know the most are most able to learn more. Through God's gift, the servant not only speaks as the learned do but hears (or learns) as the learned do as well.<\/p> ",
