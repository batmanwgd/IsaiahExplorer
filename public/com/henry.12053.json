He is not displeased with us for being earnest, as men commonly are; he bids us to cry after him, and give him no rest, <a class=\"ref\">Luke 11:5,6 <\/a>. It is a sign that God is coming to a people in mercy, when he pours out a spirit of prayer upon them. See how uncertain our creature-comforts are. See also God's mercy in giving plenty, and peace to enjoy it. Let us delight in attending the courts of the Lord, that we may enjoy the consolations of his Spirit.\n <\/p> ",
