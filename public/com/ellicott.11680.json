(Comp. <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 22:15<\/a>.)<\/p>\n <p>When thou shalt make . . .\u2014Better, if his soul shall make a trespass offering, he will see his seed; he will prolong his days . . . The sacrificial character of the death of the Servant is distinctly defined. It is a \u201ctrespass offering\u201d (<a class=\"ref\">Leviticus 6:6; Leviticus 6:17; Leviticus 14:12<\/a>), an expiation for the sins of the people. The words declare that such a sacrifice was the condition of spiritual parentage (<a class=\"ref\">Psalms 22:30<\/a>), of the immortality of influence, of eternal life with God, of accomplishing the work which the Father had given him to do (<a class=\"ref\">John 17:4<\/a>). The \u201ctrespass offering\u201d was, it must be remembered, distinct from the \u201csin offering,\u201d though both belonged to the same sacrificial group (<a class=\"ref\">Leviticus 5:15; Leviticus 7:1-7<\/a>), the distinctive element in the former being that the man who confessed his guilt, voluntary or involuntary, paid his shekels, according to the judgment of the priest, and offered a ram, the blood of which was sprinkled upon the altar. It involved, that is, the idea not of an atonement only, but of a satisfaction, according to the nature of the sin.<\/p>",
