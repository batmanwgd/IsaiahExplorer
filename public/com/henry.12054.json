He brings a reward of comfort and peace with him; but a work of humiliation and reformation before him; and they shall be called, The holy people, and, The redeemed of the Lord. Holiness puts honor and beauty upon any place or person, makes them admired, beloved, and sought after. Many events may have been part fulfillment's of this, as earnests of more glorious times yet to come. The close connection between the blessedness of the Jews and of the Gentiles, runs through the Scriptures. The Lord Jesus will complete his work, and he never will forsake one whom he has redeemed and sanctified.\n<\/p> ",
