    "html": "<p><em>But thou hast not called upon me<\/em>&mdash;The design of this and the following verses, is to show them that they were indebted to the divine mercy alone for their deliverance from bondage. It was not because they had been either meritorious or faithful; it was not because they had deserved these favors at his hand, for they had been a people that had been distinguished for neglecting their God. On that account, these calamities had come upon them, and their deliverance, therefore, was to be an act of mere unmerited favor.<\/p><p><em>Thou hast been weary<\/em>&mdash;As a people, you have been weary of my service. They had accounted his laws grievous and oppressive; and they had groaned under what they regarded as burdensome rites and ceremonies (see <a class=\"ref\">Amos 8:5-6; Malachi 1:13<\/a>). God here refers, doubtless, to the times before the captivity, and is stating what was the general characteristic of the people.<\/p> ",
