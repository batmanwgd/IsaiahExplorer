    "html": " <p> <em>And Hezekiah was glad of them <\/em>&mdash;Possibly he regarded himself as flattered by an embassage from so great a distance, and so celebrated a place as Babylon. It is certain that he erred in some way in regard to the manner in which he received them, and especially in the ostentatious display which he made of his treasures <a class=\"ref\">2 Chronicles 32:31 <\/a>. <\/p> <p> <em>And showed them the house of his precious things <\/em>&mdash;The Septuagint renders this, &Nu;&epsilon;&chi;&omega;&theta;&alpha;\u0342 Necho\u0304tha&mdash;&lsquo;The house of Nechotha,&rsquo; retaining the Hebrew word. The Margin, &lsquo;Spicery.&rsquo; The Hebrew word (\u05e0\u05db\u05ea\u05d4 nekotoh) properly means, according to Gesenius, a contusion, a breaking to pieces; hence, aromatic powder, or spices reduced to powder, and then any kind of aromatics. Hence, the word here may mean &lsquo;the house of his spices,&rsquo; as Aquila, Symmachus, and the Vulgate translate it; or &lsquo;a treasury,&rsquo; &lsquo;a storehouse,&rsquo; as the Chaldee and the Syriac here render it. It was undoubtedly a treasure or store house; but it may have taken its name from the fact, that it was mainly employed as a place in which to keep spices, unguents, and the various kinds of aromatics which were used either in public worship, or for the purposes of luxury. <\/p> <p> <em>The silver and the gold <\/em>&mdash;Possibly Hezekiah may have obtained no small quantity of silver and gold from what was left in the camp of the Assyrians. It is certain that after he was delivered from danger he was signally prospered, and became one of the most wealthy and magnificent monarchs of the east; <a class=\"ref\">2 Chronicles 32:27-28 <\/a>: &lsquo;And Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honor; and he made himself treasuries for silver and for gold, and for precious stones, and for spices, and for shields, and for all manner of pleasant jewels; storehouses also for the increase of grain, and wine, and oil; and stalls for all manner of beasts, and cotes for flocks.&rsquo; A considerable part of this wealth arose from presents which were made to him, and from gifts which were made for the service of the temple <a class=\"ref\">2 Chronicles 32:23 <\/a>. <\/p> <p> <em>And the precious ointment <\/em>&mdash;Used for anointing kings and priests. Or more probably the ointment here referred to was that which was in more common use, to anoint the body after bathing, or when they were to appear in public. <\/p> <p> <em>And all the house of his armor <\/em>&mdash;Margin, &lsquo;Vessels,&rsquo; or &lsquo;instruments,&rsquo; or &lsquo;jewels.&rsquo; The word \u05db\u05dc\u05d9 kel\u0131\u0302y denotes any article of furniture, utensil, or vessel; any trapping, instrument, or tool; and any implement of war, weapon, or arms. Probably it here refers to the latter, and denotes shields, swords, spears, such as were used in war, and such as Hezekiah had prepared for defense. The phrase is equivalent to our word arsenal (compare <a class=\"ref\">2 Chronicles 32:27 <\/a>). Solomon had an extensive arsenal of this description <a class=\"ref\">1 Kings 10:16-17 <\/a>,, and it is probable that these were regarded as a part of the necessary defense of the kingdom. <\/p> <p> <em>Nor in all his dominion <\/em>&mdash;Everything that contributed to the defense, the wealth, or the magnificence of his kingdom he showed to them. The purpose for which Hezekiah thus showed them all that he had, was evidently display. In <a class=\"ref\">2 Chronicles 32:25 <\/a>,, it is stated that &lsquo;Hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit done unto him, for his heart was lifted up;&rsquo; and in <a class=\"ref\">2 Chronicles 32:31 <\/a>,, it is said, that in regard to this transaction, &lsquo;God left him, to try him, that he might know all that was in his heart.&rsquo; The result showed how much God hates pride, and how certainly he will punish all forms of ostentation. <\/p>,",
