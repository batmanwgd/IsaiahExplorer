God's latter-day gathering will result in the uniting of the kingdoms of Judah and Israel, made possible because the gospel teaches peace and love and because the Messiah, who is the true king of Israel and Judah, rules with justice and righteousness (11:1-5). The Book of Mormon also plays a prominent role in reuniting Ephraim and Judah (<a class=\"ref\">Ezek. 37:15-28<\/a>). <\/p> ",
