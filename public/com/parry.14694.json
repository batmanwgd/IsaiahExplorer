    "html": " <p>In the context of the Song of the Vineyard (5:1-7), 5:8-25 presents a series of six woes, all of which demonstrate the low spiritual state of certain groups. The first woe (5:8-10) speaks out against the improper use of land; the second (5:11-17) contains the prophetic word on the manner in which those of the world improperly and with evil intent eat, drink, and make merry; the third (5:18-19) is directed against those who are wicked and mock God and his divine plan; the fourth (5:20) speaks against liars and those who fight against the things of God; the fifth (5:21) deals with conceited individuals who believe themselves to be wise; and the sixth (5:22-23) accuses those who give bribes and belittle the righteous.<\/p> <blockquote> Woe unto them that join house to house,     <br>till there [can] be <i>no place,<\/i>     <br>that they may be <i>placed alone<\/i> in the midst of the earth! (5:8)     <br>In mine ears said the Lord of hosts, Of a truth many houses shall be desolate, [and] great and fair, without inhabitant. (5:9)     <br>Yea, <i>ten acres of vineyard<\/i> shall yield one [<u>barrel of wine<\/u>],     <br>and the <i>[six bushels of seeds]<\/i> shall yield a [<u>bushel of grain<\/u>]. (5:10)     <br>Woe unto them that rise up <i>early in the morning,<\/i> that they may follow <u>strong drink<\/u>;     <br>[and] that continue <i>until night,<\/i> [and] <u>wine<\/u> inflame them! (5:11)     <br>And the harp, and the [lyre], the [tambourine], and [flute], and wine, are in their feasts:     <br>but they <i>regard not<\/i> the <u>work of the Lord<\/u>,     <br><i>neither consider<\/i> the <u>operation of his hands<\/u>. (5:12)     <br>Therefore my people are gone into captivity, because they have no knowledge:     <br>and <i>their honourable men<\/i> are <u>famished<\/u>,     <br>and <i>their multitude<\/i> <u>dried up with thirst<\/u>. (5:13)     <br>Therefore hell<b> <\/b>hath <i>enlarged herself,<\/i>     <br>and <i>opened her mouth<\/i> without measure:     <br>and their glory, and their multitude, and their pomp, and he that rejoiceth, shall descend into it. (5:14)     <br>And the <i>[common] man<\/i> shall be <i><u>brought down<\/u>,<\/i>     <br>and the <i>mighty man<\/i> shall be <u>humbled<\/u>,     <br>and the <i>eyes of the lofty<\/i> shall be <u>humbled<\/u>: (5:15)     <br>But the <i>Lord of hosts<\/i> shall be <u>exalted in judgment<\/u>,     <br>and <i>God<\/i> that is holy shall be <u>sanctified in righteousness<\/u>. (5:16)     <br>Then shall the <i>lambs<\/i> <u>feed<\/u> after their manner,     <br>and the waste places of the fat ones shall [<i>goats<\/i>] <u>eat<\/u>. (5:17)     <br>Woe unto them that draw <i>iniquity<\/i> with <u>cords<\/u> of vanity,     <br>and <i>sin<\/i> as it were with a cart <u>rope<\/u>: (5:18)     <br>That say, Let him make speed, <i>hasten his work,<\/i> that <u>we may see it<\/u>:     <br>and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel <i>draw nigh and come,<\/i> that <u>we may know it<\/u>! (5:19)     <br>Woe unto them that call <i>evil good,<\/i> and <u>good evil<\/u>;     <br>that put <i>darkness for light,<\/i> and <u>light for darkness<\/u>;     <br>that put <i>bitter for sweet,<\/i> and <u>sweet for bitter<\/u>! (5:20)     <br>Woe unto [the] <i>wise<\/i> in their <u>own eyes<\/u>,     <br>and <i>prudent<\/i> in their <u>own sight<\/u>! (5:21)     <br>Woe unto [the] <i>mighty<\/i> to drink <u>wine<\/u>,     <br>and <i>men of strength<\/i> to mingle <u>strong drink<\/u>: (5:22)     <br>[Who] <i>justify<\/i> the <u>wicked<\/u> for reward,     <br>and <i>take away the righteousness<\/i> of the <u>righteous<\/u> from him! (5:23)     <br>Therefore as the <i>fire<\/i> <u>devoureth the stubble<\/u>,     <br>and the <i>flame<\/i> <u>consumeth the chaff<\/u>,     <br>their <i>root<\/i> shall be <u>as rottenness<\/u>,     <br>and their <i>[lossom[s] shall go up <u>as dust<\/u>:<\/i>     <br>because they have <i>cast away<\/i> the <u>law of the Lord of hosts<\/u>,     <br>and <i>despised<\/i> the <u>word of the Holy One of Israel<\/u>. (5:24)     <br>Therefore is the <i>anger of the Lord<\/i> kindled <u>against his people<\/u>,     <br>and <i>he hath stretched forth his hand<\/i> <u>against them<\/u>, and hath smitten them:     <br>and the <i>hills<\/i> <u>did tremble<\/u>,     <br>and their <i>carcasses<\/i> <u>were torn<\/u> in the midst of the streets.     <br>For all this <i>his anger<\/i> is <u>not turned away<\/u>,     <br>but <i>his hand<\/i> is <u>stretched out still<\/u>.
