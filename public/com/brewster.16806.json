The capital city has been attacked, although unsuccessfully, by the kings of Israel (the northern kingdom) and Syria. The invading kings' desire is to place a puppet ruler over Judah, one who would be responsive to their desire to form a solid anti-Assyrian block. Seemingly concerned about the city's water supply, Ahaz is evidently inspecting it when he is approached by the prophet Isaiah, accompanied by his son, with a message from the Lord. Ahaz is told not to worry about the alliance of his enemies, for it will be broken (\"It shall not stand\") and their plans of invasion will not succeed (\"neither shall it come to pass\").<\/p>     <table>         <tbody>             <tr>                 <td><b><a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzkwXQ==\">Isaiah 7<\/a><br><br><br>1 And it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, that Rezin <u>the<\/u> king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up toward Jerusalem to war against it, but could not prevail against it.<br><br>2 And it was told the house of David, saying<u>,<\/u> Syria is confederate with Ephraim.
