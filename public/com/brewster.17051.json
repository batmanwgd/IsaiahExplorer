President Spencer W. Kimball astutely observed: \"By one means or another, the swiftest method of rejection of the holy prophets has been to find a pretext, however false or absurd, to dismiss the man so that his message could also be dismissed.\" (CR, April 1978, p. 115.)<\/p>     <p>The word of the Lord to His falsely imprisoned prophet, Joseph Smith, adds insight to this matter: \"Cursed are all those that shall lift up the heel against mine anointed, saith the Lord, and cry they have sinned when they have not sinned before me, saith the Lord, but have done that which was meet in mine eyes, and which I commanded them.<\/p>     <p>\"But those who cry transgression do it because they are the servants of sin, and are the children of disobedience themselves.\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 121:16-17<\/a>.)<\/p>",
