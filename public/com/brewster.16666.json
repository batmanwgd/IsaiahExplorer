(<a class=\"ref\">2 Nephi 11:8<\/a>)\" (BMC, 173.)<\/p>     <p>Monte Nyman has written: \"Although Isaiah notes that he saw things concerning Judah and Jerusalem (2:1), his vision includes references to three different peoples and two different lands. . . . The three peoples include the inhabitants of Jerusalem in general, the inhabitants of Zion in general, and the specific group from Zion and Jerusalem who constitute the beautiful and glorious branch of the Lord. The two lands include the land of Jerusalem and the land of the Americas.<\/p>     <p>\"Justification for Isaiah's including people not of Judah and not living in Jerusalem in a vision of Judah and Jerusalem is shown in the Savior's words regarding Isaiah: 'for surely he spake as touching all things concerning my people which are of the house of Israel; therefore it must needs be that he must speak also to the Gentiles' (<a class=\"ref\">3 Nephi 23:2<\/a>). Just as it was necessary to speak to or about the Gentiles to show all things concerning the house of Israel, it was also necessary to speak to or about Zion to show the ultimate destiny of Judah.\"(GAWI, 23-24.)<\/p>",
