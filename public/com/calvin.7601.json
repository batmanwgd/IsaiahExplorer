    "html": "<p><i> Let the desert and it\u2019s cities cry aloud.<\/i> While the Prophet includes all the parts of the world, he mentions particularly those which were better known to the Jews; for on the west Judea had the sea, and on the east the desert and Arabia. When he speaks of the tents of<i> Kedar,<\/i> the<i> desert,<\/i> and the<i> rocks,<\/i> he means Arabia; but it is a figure of speech by which a part is taken for the whole, for it includes the whole of the east. It is as if he had said, that from the rising to the setting of the sun these praises shall be heard; for God shall be worshipped everywhere, though formerly he was worshipped in Judea alone; and thus the state of affairs shall be changed, and that praise shall be beard in the most distant parts of the earth.<\/p> \n<p><i> The towns where Kedar dwells.<\/i> He mentions<i> Kedar,<\/i> because the Scenite Arabians, as is well known, dwelt in tents. But he employs the word<i> towns,<\/i> while he is speaking of a desert; and therefore it ought to be remarked, that<i> desert<\/i> denotes not only the vast wilderness which lay between Judea and Arabia, but the more distant countries which were commonly designated from that part which was adjoining to them, as some people give the name of \u201cmountainous\u201d to those plains which lie beyond the mountains; for the common people have their attention so much directed to what they see close at hand, that they suppose them to resemble other places that are more distant. Yet the Prophet here exalts and magnifies the greatness of the grace of God, in reaching even rude and barbarous nations, whose savage cruelty was well known.<\/p> ",
