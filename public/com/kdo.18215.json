    "html": "<p> The prophet now proceeds to depict the \u05d9\u05e9\u05c1\u05d5\u05bc\u05e2\u05d4 , the symbol of which is the helmet upon Jehovah's head. <em> \u201cAnd they will fear the name of Jehovah from the west, and His glory from the rising of the sun: for He will come like a stream dammed up, which a tempest of Jehovah drives away. And a Redeemer comes for Zion, and for those who turn from apostasy in Jacob, saith Jehovah.\u201d<\/em> Instead of \u05d5\u05d9\u05e8\u05d0\u05d5\u05bc , Knobel would strike out the metheg, and read \u05d5\u05d9\u05e8\u05d0\u05d5\u05bc , \u201cand they will see;\u201d but \u201cseeing the name of Jehovah\u201d (the usual expression is \u201cseeing His glory\u201d) is a phrase that cannot be met with, though it is certainly a passable one; and the relation in which  stands to  does not recommend the alteration, since  attributes that general fear of the name of Jehovah (cf., <a class=\"ref\">Deuteronomy 28:58<\/a>) and of His glory (see the parallel overlooked by Knobel, <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 102:16<\/a>), which follows the manifestation of judgment on the part of Jehovah, to the manner in which this manifestation occurs. Moreover, the true Masoretic reading in this passage is not \u05d5\u05d9\u05e8\u05d0\u05d5 (as in <a class=\"ref\">Micah 7:17<\/a>), but \u05d5\u05d9\u05d9\u05e8\u05d0\u05d5 (see Norzi). The two \u05de\u05df in \u05de\u05de\u05bc\u05e2\u05e8\u05d1 (with the indispensable metheg before the <em> c hateph <\/em> , and a second to ensure clearness of pronunciation)<\/p><p> (Note: See the law in B\u00e4r's <em> Metheg-Setzung<\/em> , \u00a729.)<\/p><p> and \u05d5\u05bc\u05de\u05de\u05bc\u05d6\u05e8\u05d7\u05be\u05e9\u05c1\u05de\u05e9\u05c1 (also with the so-called strong <em> m etheg<\/em> )<\/p><p> (Note: See <em> idem<\/em> , \u00a728.)<\/p><p> indicate the <em> terminus a quo <\/em> . From all quarters of the globe will fear of the name and of the glory of Jehovah become naturalized among the nations of the world. For when God has withdrawn His name and His glory from the world's history, as during the Babylonian captivity (and also at the present time), the return of both is all the more intense and extraordinary; and this is represented here in a figure which recals <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgyNDUiOjJ9LHsiMTc4NzMiOjJ9XQ==\">Isaiah 30:27-28; Isaiah 10:22-23<\/a> (cf., <a class=\"ref\">Ezekiel 43:2<\/a>). The accentuation, which gives <em> pashta<\/em> to \u05db\u05e0\u05bc\u05d4\u05e8 , does indeed appear to make \u05e6\u05e8 the subject, either in the sense of oppressor or adversary, as in <a class=\"ref\">Lamentations 4:12<\/a>, or in that of oppression, as in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTIzLDE4MTQ3LDE4MjM4XQ==\">Isaiah 25:4; Isaiah 26:16; Isaiah 30:20<\/a>. The former is quite out of the question, since no such transition to a human instrument of the retributive judgment could well take place after the \u05dc\u05e6\u05e8\u05d9\u05d5 \u05d7\u05de\u05d4 in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODE5XQ==\">Isaiah 59:18<\/a>. In support of the latter, it would be possible to quote <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NjMzXQ==\">Isaiah 48:18<\/a> and <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4OTM1XQ==\">Isaiah 66:12<\/a>, since \u05e6\u05e8 is the antithesis to <em> sha\u0302lo\u0304m <\/em> . But according to such parallels as <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODI0NSI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 30:27-28<\/a>, it is incomparably more natural to take Jehovah (His name, His glory) as the subject. Moreover, \u05d1\u05bc\u05d5 , which must in any case refer to \u05db\u05e0\u05d4\u05e8 , is opposed to the idea that \u05e6\u05e8 is the subject, to which \u05d1\u05d5 would have the most natural claim to be referred - an explanation indeed which Stier and Hahn have really tried, taking \u05e0\u05d5\u05e1\u05e1\u05d7 as in <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 60:4<\/a>, and rendering it \u201cThe Spirit of Jehovah holds up a banner against him, viz., the enemy.\u201d If, however, Jehovah is the subject to \u05d9\u05d1\u05d0 , \u05e6\u05e8 \u05db\u05e0\u05bc\u05d4\u05e8 must be taken together (like \u05de\u05db\u05e1\u05bc\u05d9\u05dd ... \u05db\u05bc\u05de\u05bc\u05d9\u05dd , <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxNzg5NF0seyIxNzY1NiI6MzF9LFsxNjMwNF1d\">Isaiah 11:9; \u05d8\u05d5\u05d1\u05d4 \u05e8\u05d5\u05bc\u05d7\u05da , Psalms 143:10<\/a>; Ges. \u00a7111, 2,<em> b<\/em> ), either in the sense of \u201ca hemming stream,\u201d one causing as it were a state of siege (from <em> tsu\u0304r <\/em> , <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MDM4LDE4MTk3XQ==\">Isaiah 21:2; Isaiah 29:3<\/a>), or, better still, according to the adjective use of the noun \u05e6\u05e8 (here with <em> tzakeph <\/em> , \u05e6\u05e8 from \u05e6\u05e8\u05e8 ) in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTg1LDEzODk2LDk2NzZd\">Isaiah 28:20; Job 41:7; 2 Kings 6:1<\/a>, a closely confined stream, to whose waters the banks form a compressing dam, which it bursts through when agitated by a tempest, carrying everything away with it. <\/p><p> Accordingly, the explanation we adopt is this: Jehovah will come like the stream, a stream hemmed in, which a wind of Jehovah, i.e., (like \u201cthe mountains of God,\u201d \u201ccedars of God,\u201d \u201cgarden of Jehovah,\u201d <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4Njc3XQ==\">Isaiah 51:3<\/a>, cf., <a class=\"ref\">Numbers 24:6<\/a>) a strong tempestuous wind, sweeps away ( \u05d1\u05bc\u05d5 \u05e0\u05e1\u05e1\u05d4 , <em> no\u0304s e sa<\/em> -<em> b<\/em> -<em> bo\u0302 <\/em> , with the tone drawn back and <em> dagesh forte conj.<\/em> in the monosyllable, the <em> pilel<\/em> of <em> nu\u0304s <\/em> with <em> Beth<\/em> : to hunt into, to press upon and put to flight) - a figure which also indicates that the Spirit of Jehovah is the driving force in this His judicially gracious revelation of Himself. Then, when the name of Jehovah makes itself legible once more as with letters of fire, when His glory comes like a sea of fire within the horizon of the world's history, all the world form west to east, from east to west, will begin to fear Him. But the true object of the love, which bursts forth through this revelation of wrath, is His church, which includes not only those who have retained their faith, but all who have been truly converted to Him. And He comes ( \u05d5\u05bc\u05d1\u05d0 ) a continuation of \u05d9\u05d1\u05d0 ) for Zion a Redeemer, i.e., as a Redeemer (a closer definition of the predicate), and for those who turn away from apostasy ( \u05e4\u05e9\u05c1\u05e2 \u05e9\u05c1\u05d1\u05d9 , compare <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NjgyXQ==\">Isaiah 1:27<\/a>, and for the genitive connection <a class=\"ref\">Micah 2:8<\/a>, \u05de\u05dc\u05d7\u05de\u05d4 \u05e9\u05c1\u05d5\u05bc\u05d1\u05d9 , those who have turned away form the war). The <em> Vav<\/em> here does not signify \u201cand indeed,\u201d as in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4Nzg0XQ==\">Isaiah 57:18<\/a>, but \u201cmore especially.\u201d He comes as a Redeemer for Zion, i.e., His church which has remained true, including those who turn again to Jehovah from their previous apostasy. In <a class=\"ref\">Romans 11:26<\/a> the apostle quotes this word of God, which is sealed with \u201cThus saith Jehovah,\u201d as a proof of the final restoration of all Israel; for \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d4 (according to the Apocalypse, \u03bf\u0314 \u03c9\u0313\u0301\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9\u0300 \u03bf\u0314 \u03b7\u0313\u0342\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9\u0300 \u03bf\u0314 \u03b5\u0313\u03c1\u03c7\u03bf\u0301\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 ) is to him the God who moves on through the Old Testament towards the goal of His incarnation, and through the New Testament towards that of His parousia in Christ, which will bring the world's history to a close. But this final close does not take place without its having become apparent at the same time that God \u201chas concluded all in unbelief that He may have compassion upon all\u201d (<a class=\"ref\">Romans 11:32<\/a>).<\/p>",
