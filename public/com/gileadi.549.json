As they are all she has ever known, and as she answers to no one but herself, she resorts to them even when disaster stares her in the face. Failing that, her statisticians, forecasters of trends, or astrologers may have the solution to her plight. Her tactics or schemes have paid off in the past. Why shouldn&rsquo;t they now? As she has always been a law unto herself&mdash;supplanting the true God with herself&mdash;who or what is left that she can turn to that might save her?<\/p> ",
