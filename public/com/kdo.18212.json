    "html": "<p> In the second strophe the prophet includes himself when speaking of the people. They now mourn over that state of exhaustion into which they have been brought through the perpetual straining and disappointment of expectation, and confess those sins on account of which the righteousness and salvation of Jehovah have been withheld. The prophet is speaking communicatively here; for even the better portion of the nation was involved in the guilt and consequences of the corruption which prevailed among the exiles, inasmuch as a nation forms an organized whole, and the delay of redemption really affected them. <em> \u201cTherefore right remains far from us, and righteousness does not overtake us; we hope for light, and behold darkness; for brightness - we walk in thick darkness. We grope along the wall like the blind, and like eyeless men we grope: we stumble in the light of noon-day as in the darkness, and among the living like the dead. We roar all like bears, and moan deeply like doves: we hope for right, and it cometh not; for salvation - it remaineth far off from us.\u201d<\/em> At the end of this group of verses, again, the thought with which it sets out is palindromically repeated. The perfect \u05e8\u05d7\u05e7\u05d4 denotes a state of things reaching from the past into the present; the future \u05ea\u05e9\u05bc\u05c2\u05d9\u05d2\u05e0\u05d5\u05bc a state of things continuing unchangeable in the present. By <em> m ishpa\u0302t <\/em> we understand a solution of existing inequalities or incongruities through the judicial interposition of God; by <em> ts e da\u0302qa\u0302h <\/em> the manifestation of justice, which bestows upon Israel grace as its right in accordance with the plan of salvation after the long continuance of punishment, and pours out merited punishment upon the instruments employed in punishing Israel. The prophet's standpoint, whether a real or an ideal one, is the last decade of the captivity. At that time, about the period of the Lydian war, when Cyrus was making one prosperous stroke after another, and yet waited so long before he turned his arms against Babylon, it may easily be supposed that hope and despondency alternated incessantly in the minds of the exiles. The dark future, which the prophet penetrated in the light of the Spirit, was indeed broken up by rays of hope, but it did not amount to light, i.e., to a perfect lighting up (<em> n e go\u0304ho\u0304th <\/em> , an intensified plural of <em> n e go\u0304ha\u0302h <\/em> , like <em> n e kho\u0304cho\u0304th <\/em> in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTQxXQ==\">Isaiah 26:10<\/a>, pl. of <em> n e kho\u0304cha\u0302h <\/em> in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODE1XQ==\">Isaiah 59:14<\/a>); on the contrary, darkness was still the prevailing state, and in the deep thick darkness (<em> ' a\u0306phe\u0304lo\u0304th <\/em> ) the exiles pined away, without the promised release being effected for them by the oppressor of the nations. \u201cWe grope,\u201d they here complain, \u201clike blind men by a wall, in which there is no opening, and like eyeless men we grope.\u201d \u05d2\u05bc\u05e9\u05bc\u05c1\u05e9\u05c1 (only used here) is a synonym of the older \u05de\u05e9\u05bc\u05c1\u05e9\u05c1 (<a class=\"ref\">Deuteronomy 28:29<\/a>); \u05e0\u05d2\u05e9\u05c1\u05e9\u05c1\u05d4 (with the elision of the reduplication, which it is hardly possible to render audible, and which comes up again in the pausal \u05e0\u05d2\u05e9\u05bc\u05c1\u05e9\u05c1\u05d4 ) has the <em> a\u0302h <\/em> of force, here of the impulse to self-preservation, which leads them to grope for an outlet in this \u03b1\u0313\u03c0\u03bf\u03c1\u03b9\u0301\u03b1 ; and \u05e2\u05d9\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd \u05d0\u05d9\u05df is not quite synonymous with \u05e2\u05d5\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd , for there is such a thing as blindness with apparently sound eyes (cf., <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NTE0XQ==\">Isaiah 43:8<\/a>); and there is also a real absence of eyes, on account of either a natural malformation, or the actual loss of the eyes through either external injury or disease.<\/p><p> In the lamentation which follows, \u201cwe stumble in the light of noon-day ( \u05e6\u05d4\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd , <em> m eridies <\/em> = <em> m esidies <\/em> , the culminating point at which the eastern light is separated from the western) as if it were darkness, and \u05d1\u05bc\u05d0\u05e9\u05c1\u05de\u05e0\u05bc\u05d9\u05dd , as if we were dead men,\u201d we may infer from the parallelism that since \u05d1\u05bc\u05d0\u05e9\u05c1\u05de\u05e0\u05bc\u05d9\u05dd must express some antithesis to \u05db\u05bc\u05de\u05bc\u05ea\u05d9\u05dd , it cannot mean either <em> in c aliginosis <\/em> (Jer., Luther, etc.), or \u201cin the graves\u201d (Targ., D. Kimchi, etc.), or \u201cin desolate places\u201d (J. Kimchi). Moreover, there is no such word in Hebrew as \u05d0\u05e9\u05c1\u05dd , to be dark, although the lexicographers give a Syriac word \u05d0\u05d5\u05bc\u05ea\u05de\u05e0\u05d0 , thick darkness (possibly related to Arab. <em> \u201batamat <\/em> , which does not mean the dark night, but late in the night); and the verb <em> sha\u0302me\u0304n <\/em> , to be fat, is never applied to \u201cfat, i.e., thick darkness,\u201d as Knobel assumes, whilst the form of the word with \u05e0 <em> c. dagesh<\/em> precludes the meaning a solitary place or desert (from \u05d0\u05e9\u05c1\u05dd = \u05e9\u05c1\u05de\u05dd ). The form in question points rather to the verbal stem \u05e9\u05c1\u05de\u05df , which yields a fitting antithesis to \u05db\u05de\u05ea\u05d9\u05dd , whether we explain it as meaning \u201cin luxuriant fields,\u201d or \u201camong the fat ones, i.e., those who glory in their abundant health.\u201d We prefer the latter, since the word <em> m ishmann\u0131\u0304m <\/em> (<a class=\"ref\">Daniel 11:24<\/a>; cf., <a class=\"ref\">Genesis 27:28<\/a>) had already been coined to express the other idea; and as a rule, words formed with \u05d0 <em> prosth.<\/em> point rather to an attributive than to a substantive idea. \u05d0\u05e9\u05c1\u05de\u05df is a more emphatic form of \u05e9\u05c1\u05de\u05df (<a class=\"ref\">Judges 3:29<\/a>);<\/p><p> (Note: The name of the Phoenician god of health and prosperity, viz., Esmoun, which Alois M\u00fcller (Esmun, <em> ein Beitrag zur Mythologie des orient<\/em> . Alterthums. 1864) traces to \u05d7\u05e9\u05c1\u05de\u05df (<a class=\"ref\">Psalms 68:32<\/a>) from \u05d0\u05e9\u05c1\u05dd = \u05d7\u05e9\u05c1\u05dd , \u201cthe splendid one (<em> illustris <\/em> ),\u201d probably means \u201cthe healthy one, or one of full health\u201d (after the form \u05d0\u05e9\u05c1\u05d7\u05d5\u05bc\u05e8 , \u05d0\u05e9\u05c1\u05de\u05d5\u05bc\u05e8\u05d4 ), which agrees somewhat better with the account of Photios: \u0313\u0301\u0395\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd \u03c5\u0314\u03c0\u03bf\u0300 \u03a6\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03b9\u0301\u03ba\u03c9\u03bd \u03c9\u0313\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03c3\u03bc\u03b5\u0301\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd \u03b5\u0313\u03c0\u03b9\u0300 \u03c4\u03b7\u0345\u0342 \u03b8\u03b5\u0301\u03c1\u03bc\u03b7 \u03c4\u03b7\u0342\u03c2 \u03b6\u03c9\u03b7\u0342\u03c2 .)<\/p><p> and \u05d0\u05e9\u05c1\u05de\u05e0\u05bc\u05d9\u05dd indicates indirectly the very same thing which is directly expressed by \u05de\u05e9\u05c1\u05de\u05e0\u05bc\u05d9\u05dd in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODY3XQ==\">Isaiah 10:16<\/a>. Such explanations as \u201c<em> in opimis rebus <\/em> \u201d (Stier, etc.), or \u201cin fatness of body, i.e., fulness of life\u201d (B\u00f6ttcher), are neither so suitable to the form of the word, nor do they answer to the circumstances referred to here, where all the people in exile are speaking. The true meaning therefore is, \u201cwe stumble (reel about) among fat ones, or those who lead a merry life,\u201d as if we were dead. \u201cAnd what,\u201d as Doederlein observes, \u201ccan be imagined more gloomy and sad, than to be wandering about like shades, while others are fat and flourishing?\u201d The growling and moaning in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODEyXQ==\">Isaiah 59:11<\/a> are expressions of impatience and pain produced by longing. The people now fall into a state of impatience, and roar like bears (<em> ha\u0302ma\u0302h <\/em> like <em> fremere <\/em> ), as when, for example, a bear scents a flock, and prowls about it (<em> vespertinus circumgemit ursus ovile <\/em> : Hor. <em> Ep<\/em> . xvi. 51); and now again they give themselves up to melancholy, and moan in a low and mournful tone like the doves, <em> quarum blanditias verbaque murmur habet <\/em> (Ovid). \u05d4\u05d2\u05d4 , like <em> murmurare <\/em> , expresses less depth of tone or <em> raucitas <\/em> than \u05d4\u05de\u05d4 . All their looking for righteousness and salvation turns out again and again to be nothing but self-deception, when the time for their coming seems close at hand.<\/p>",
