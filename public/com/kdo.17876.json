    "html": "<p> In the land of promise there is rejoicing, but on the other side of the Jordan there is fear of ruin. Two contrasted pictures are placed here side by side. The Jordan is the same as the \u201cgreat gulf\u201d in the parable of the rich man. Upon Zion Jehovah descends in mercy, but upon the highlands of Moab in His wrath. <em> \u201cFor the hand of Jehovah will sink down upon this mountain, and Moab is trodden down there where it is, as straw is trodden down in the water of the dung-pit. And he spreadeth out his hands in the pool therein, as the swimmer spreadeth them out to swim; but Jehovah forceth down the pride of Moab in spite of the artifices of his hands. Yea, thy steep, towering walls He bows down, forces under, and casts earthwards into dust.\u201d<\/em> Jehovah brings down His hand upon Zion (<em> nu\u0304ach <\/em> , as in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3Nzg1LDE3ODg2XQ==\">Isaiah 7:2; Isaiah 11:1<\/a>), not only to shelter, but also to avenge. Israel, that has been despised, He now makes glorious, and for contemptuous Moab He prepares a shameful end. In the place where it now is \u05ea\u05bc\u05d7\u05ea\u05bc\u05d9\u05d5 , as in <a class=\"ref\">2 Samuel 7:10; Habakkuk 3:16<\/a>, \u201cin its own place,\u201d its own land) it is threshed down, stamped or trodden down, as straw is trodden down into a dung-pit to turn it into manure: <em> hiddu\u0304sh <\/em> , the <em> inf. constr.<\/em> , with the vowel sound <em> u<\/em> , possibly to distinguish it from the <em> inf. absol.<\/em> <em> hiddosh <\/em> (Ewald, \u00a7240,<em> b<\/em> ). Instead of \u05d1\u05bc\u05de\u05d5 (as in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NTA4XQ==\">Isaiah 43:2<\/a>), the <em> chethib<\/em> has \u05d1\u05bc\u05de\u05d9 (cf., <a class=\"ref\">Job 9:30<\/a>); and this is probably the more correct reading, since <em> m adme\u0304na\u0302h <\/em> , by itself, means the dunghill, and not the tank of dung water. At the same time, it is quite possible that <em> b'mo <\/em> is intended as a play upon the name <em> Moab<\/em> , just as the word <em> m adme\u0304na\u0302h <\/em> may possibly have been chosen with a play upon the Moabitish <em> Madme\u0304n <\/em> (<a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 48:2<\/a>). In <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTMwXQ==\">Isaiah 25:11<\/a> Jehovah would be the subject, if <em> b'kirbo <\/em> (in the midst of it) referred back to Moab; but although the figure of Jehovah pressing down the pride of Moab, by spreading out His hands within it like a swimmer, might produce the impression of boldness and dignity in a different connection, yet here, where Moab has just been described as forced down into the manure-pit, the comparison of Jehovah to a swimmer would be a very offensive one. The swimmer is Moab itself, as Gesenius, Hitzig, Knobel, and in fact the majority of commentators suppose. \u201c<em> In the midst of it:<\/em> \u201d <em> b'kirbo <\/em> points back in a neuter sense to the place into which Moab had been violently plunged, and which was so little adapted for swimming. A man cannot swim in a manure pond; but Moab attempts it, though without success, for Jehovah presses down the pride of Moab in spite of its artifices \u05e2\u05dd , as in <a class=\"ref\">Nehemiah 5:18<\/a>; \u05d0\u05e8\u05d1\u05bc\u05d5\u05ea , written with <em> dagesh<\/em> (according to the majority of MSS, from \u05d0\u05e8\u05d1\u05bc\u05d4 , like the Arabic <em> urbe <\/em> , <em> irbe <\/em> , cleverness, wit, sharpness), i.e., the skilful and cunning movement of its hands. Saad. gives it correctly, as <em> m ucha\u0302tale <\/em> , wiles and stratagems; Hitzig also renders it \u201cmachinations,\u201d i.e., twistings and turnings, which Moab makes with its arms, for the purpose of keeping itself up in the water. What <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTMwXQ==\">Isaiah 25:11<\/a> affirms in figure, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTMxXQ==\">Isaiah 25:12<\/a> illustrates without any figure. If the reading were \u05de\u05d1\u05e6\u05e8 \u05da \u05d7\u05d5\u05de\u05d5\u05ea \u05de\u05e9\u05c2\u05d2\u05bc\u05d1 , the reference would be to Kir-Moab (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3OTYyLDE3OTc3XQ==\">Isaiah 15:1; Isaiah 16:7<\/a>). But as the text stands, we are evidently to understand by it the strong and lofty walls of the cities of Moab in general.<\/p>",
