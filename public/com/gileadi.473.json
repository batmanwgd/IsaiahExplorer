Whereas his people stand in awe of them, in reality they are &ldquo;of no account&rdquo; and their works amount to &ldquo;nothing.&rdquo; That recurring chaos motif in chapters 40-46 puts these prophets in the same category as idolaters and enemies who perish in Jehovah&rsquo;s Day of Judgment (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg0MzgiOjh9LHsiMTg0NTQiOjZ9LFsxODQ2M10seyIxODQ5OCI6OX0sWzE4NTQzLDE4NTU0XV0=\">Isaiah 40:17-24; 41:2-7, 11; 42:17-25; 44:9, 20<\/a>).
