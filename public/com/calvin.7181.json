Here he means those chariots in which the horsemen rode. <\/p> \n <p>Had it been a threatening, it would have been proper to translate it in the future tense, \u201cAnd it shall be;\u201d but as the words which immediately follow are in the past tense, and as there is reason to believe that the Prophet is relating events which have already taken place, I have not hesitated to make this beginning agree with what follows. \u201cThe choice of the valleys\u201d means \u201cthe choicest valleys.\u201d He reminds the Jews of those straits to which they were reduced when the enemies were at their gates. They ought at that time to have sought help from God; but those wretched people became more strongly alienated from God, and more shamefully manifested their rebellion, which shewed them to be men utterly abandoned, and therefore he reproaches them with this hardened obstinacy. <\/p> ",
