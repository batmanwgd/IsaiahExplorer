Jehovah disabuses their minds when he stretches out his<em>hand<\/em> over them as did Moses when Pharaoh&rsquo;s armies who pursued the Israelites drowned in the depths of the sea (<a class=\"ref\">Exodus 14:21-28<\/a>). Jehovah&rsquo;s<em>hand<\/em> &mdash;in this instance, the king of Assyria\/Babylon&mdash;invades Egypt and takes captive many of its inhabitants (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgwMzQiOjJ9LFsxODM3OF1d\">Isaiah 20:4-5; 37:25<\/a>). Like all the wicked in that day, the Egyptians and their allies &ldquo;stumble&rdquo; and &ldquo;fall&rdquo; and &ldquo;come to an end&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxNzcxNl0seyIxNzgyMiI6Mn0sWzE3ODU1LDE3OTIyLDE4MDQ1LDE4MTc4LDE4ODExXV0=\">Isaiah 3:8; 8:14-15; 10:4; 13:15; 21:9; 28:13; 59:10<\/a>).<\/p> ",
