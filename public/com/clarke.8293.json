    "html": "<p><em>Wo to the multitude\u2014<\/em>The three last verses of this chapter seem to have no relation to the foregoing prophecy, to which they are joined. It is a beautiful piece, standing singly and by itself; for neither has it any connection with what follows: whether it stands in its right place, or not, I cannot say. It is a noble description of the formidable invasion and the sudden overthrow of Sennacherib; which is intimated in the strongest terms and the most expressive images, exactly suitable to the event.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Like the rushing of mighty waters!\u2014<\/em>Five words, three at the end of the twelfth verse, and two at the beginning of the thirteenth, are omitted in eight MSS., with the Syriac; that is, in effect, the repetition contained in the first line of  <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3OTk3XQ==\">Isaiah 17:13<\/a>; in this translation, is not made. After having observed that it is equally easy to account for the omission of these words by a transcriber if they are genuine, or their insertion if they are not genuine, occasioned by his carrying his eye backwards to the word <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05dc\u05d0\u05de\u05d9\u05dd <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">leammim<\/span>, or forwards to <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d9\u05e9\u05d0\u05d5\u05df <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">yeshaon<\/span>, I shall leave it to the reader's judgment to determine whether they are genuine or not.
