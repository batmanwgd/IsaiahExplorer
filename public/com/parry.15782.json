    "html": " <p>The Lord continues his promises to latter-day Israel: He will establish her in righteousness and protect her from oppression (54:14). Those who seek to fight against her will fail (54:15, 17); those who speak against her will be condemned (54:17). Her city, the New Jerusalem, will be beautiful (54:11-12), and her children will \"be taught of the Lord\" and will have peace (54:13).<\/p> <p>This passage promises rich blessings to the faithful: The promise of peace (54:14) fulfills the covenant spoken of in 54:10. The blessing of righteousness (54:14, 17) flows from Christ's atonement (54:11). Those now afflicted by life's storms (54:11) will yet be established on safe, firm foundations (54:11, 14). And the people \"not comforted\" (54:11) will be taught, protected, and blessed (54:13-17).<\/p> <p>These things come to the faithful through right of inheritance (54:17). Though our diligent efforts are necessary to bring us to the Lord, ultimately it is his grace that enables us to receive his blessings: \"their righteousness is of me, saith the Lord\" (54:17).<\/p> <blockquote> O thou <i>afflicted,<\/i>     <br><i>tossed with tempest,<\/i>     <br>and <i>not comforted!<\/i>     <br>Behold, I will <i>lay thy stones<\/i> with <u>fair colours<\/u>,     <br>and <i>lay thy foundations<\/i> with <u>sapphires<\/u>. (54:11)     <br>And I will make <i>thy windows <\/i><u>of agates<\/u>,     <br>and <i>thy<\/i> <i>gates <\/i><u>of carbuncles<\/u>,     <br>and all <i>thy<\/i> <i>borders <\/i><u>of pleasant stones<\/u>. (54:12)     <br>And all <i>thy children<\/i> <u>shall be taught of the Lord<\/u>;     <br>and <u>great shall be the peace<\/u> of <i>thy children.<\/i> (54:13)     <br>In righteousness shalt thou be established:     <br>thou shalt be far <i>from oppression;<\/i> for <u>thou shalt not fear<\/u>:     <br>and <i>from terror;<\/i> for <u>it shall not come near thee<\/u>. (54:14)     <br>Behold, <i>they shall surely gather together<\/i> [<u>against thee<\/u>],&hellip;not by me:     <br><i>whosoever shall gather together<\/i> <u>against thee<\/u> shall fall for thy sake. (54:15)     <br>Behold, I have created the <i>smith<\/i> that <u>bloweth the coals in the fire<\/u>,     <br>and <i>that<\/i> <u>bringeth forth an instrument<\/u> for his work<i>;<\/i>     <br>and I have created the waster to destroy. (54:16)     <br>No <i>weapon<\/i> <i>that is<\/i> <i>formed <\/i><u>against thee<\/u> shall prosper;     <br>and <i>every tongue that shall [revile] <u>against thee<\/u> in judgment thou shalt condemn.<\/i>     <br>This is the heritage of the servants of the Lord, and their righteousness is of me, saith the Lord.
