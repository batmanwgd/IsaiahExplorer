The Hebrew word <span class=\"greek-hebrew\"> \u05e2\u05e9\u05e7 <\/span> (<i>gn\u014dsh\u0115k<\/i>) denotes \u201crobbery,\u201d and \u201cseizing property which belongs to another.\u201d Others render it \u201cill-gotten wealth.\u201d Those who render it \u201ccalumny,\u201d do not sufficiently express the Prophet\u2019s meaning.

And as the poets feign that the giants made war with God, so those men resisted God\u2019s threatenings, and thought that they would speedily overcome his power by their fierceness and presumption. <\/p> ",
