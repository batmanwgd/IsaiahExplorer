Reduced to refugee status, they want someone to cover their sins and care for them. Parallel lines&mdash;&ldquo;to those who rule in the earth&rdquo; and &ldquo;to the mountain of the Daughter of Zion&rdquo;&mdash;imply that the Moabites are appealing for help to Jehovah&rsquo;s people in Zion who have now come into their own. The reference to Moab&rsquo;s &ldquo;women&rdquo; may be both literal and figurative (cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 3:12; 19:16<\/a>).<\/p>",
