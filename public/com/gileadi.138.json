National disasters, symbolized by the covenant curses of fallen buildings and destroyed trees, are taken in stride as if they are merely temporary setbacks, not signs of a protracted trend brought on by Jehovah&rsquo;s judgments. Steeped in &ldquo;pride and arrogance of heart,&rdquo; Jehovah&rsquo;s people assume that by their own wisdom and strength they will regroup and rebuild even bigger and better. <\/p> ",
