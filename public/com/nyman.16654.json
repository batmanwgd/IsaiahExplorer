(KJV, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4OTE4XQ==\">Isaiah 65:20<\/a>.) <\/td>                 <td><i>In those days<\/i> there shall be no more thence an infant of days, nor an old man that hath not filled his days; for the child shall <i>not<\/i> die, <i>but shall live to be<\/i> an hundred years old; but the sinner, <i>living to be<\/i> an hundred years old, shall be accursed. (JST, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4OTE4XQ==\">Isaiah 65:20<\/a>.) <\/td>             <\/tr>         <\/tbody>     <\/table>     <p>During the Millennium, the life span of man will be extended to the \"age of a tree,\" or approximately 100 years. There will be no infant mortality, but all people will live out their days and then be changed from mortality to immortality instantaneously, or \"in the twinkling of an eye\" (see <a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 101:30-31; 63:50<\/a>). However, there will still be agency on the earth, and man must choose between an honorable terrestrial life and a glorified celestial one. There will be many, particularly during the beginning of the Millennium, who will not yet be members of the Church but will be honorable people by the earth's standards (see Joseph Fielding Smith, DS, 3:63-64; <i>AQ,<\/i> 2:20-21; 5:141-42).<\/p>     ",
