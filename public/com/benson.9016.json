In the subsequent verses the prophet enters into particulars. This general interpretation is fully verified by the history of the Jewish people, especially in the time of our Lord and his apostles:<i> and the men of Judah his pleasant plant<\/i> \u2014 In whom God formerly delighted;<i> and he looked for judgment<\/i> \u2014 Both the administration of justice by magistrates, and justice in the dealings of the people with one another:<i> but behold oppression<\/i> \u2014 From the powerful upon their inferiors; and<i> for righteousness \u2014<\/i> For equity, mercy, and benevolence;<i> but behold a cry<\/i> \u2014 From the oppressed, crying to men for help, and to God for vengeance. \u201cThe paronomasia, or play on the words, in the Hebrew, in this place, is very remarkable;<i> mispat, mispach; zedakah, zeakah.<\/i> There are many examples of it in the other prophets; but Isaiah seems peculiarly fond of it. The rabbins esteem it a great beauty: their term for it is,<i> elegance of language.\u201d<\/i> \u2014 Bishop Lowth.<\/p> ",
