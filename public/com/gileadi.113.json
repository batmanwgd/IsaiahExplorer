    "html": "<p>Isaiah&rsquo;s word to Ahaz&mdash;&ldquo;from Jehovah your God&rdquo;&mdash;is twofold: (1) it is a symbolic reminder of Jehovah&rsquo;s covenant with King David, Ahaz&rsquo; ancestor, including the idea that the scheme to overthrow Ahaz will bring covenant curses on those who attempt it (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzc4NCI6OX0=\">vv 1-9<\/a>); and (2) it constitutes a &ldquo;sign&rdquo; or &ldquo;confirmation&rdquo; (<em>&rsquo;ot<\/em>) that Jehovah will fulfill his promise (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzc5MyI6OH0=\">vv 10-17<\/a>). Ahaz, however, responds with pious hypocrisy, quoting <a class=\"ref\">Deuteronomy 6:16<\/a> about not putting Jehovah to the test. In his disloyalty and inability to believe Jehovah&rsquo;s word, Ahaz refuses confirmation and thus puts himself above Isaiah.<\/p>",
