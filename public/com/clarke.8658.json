    "html": "<p><em>Jesurun\u2014<\/em>Jeshurun means Israel. This name was given to that people by Moses,  <a class=\"ref\">Deuteronomy 32:15;  Deuteronomy 33:5,  Deuteronomy 33:26<\/a>. The most probable account of it seems to be that in which the Jewish commentators agree; namely, that it is derived from <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d9\u05e9\u05e8 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">yashar<\/span>, and signifies upright. In the same manner, Israel, as a people, is called <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05de\u05e9\u05dc\u05dd <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">meshullam<\/span>, perfect,  <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NTAwXQ==\">Isaiah 42:19<\/a>, They were taught of God, and abundantly furnished with the means of rectitude and perfection in his service and worship. Grotius thinks that <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d5\u05df <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">yeshurun<\/span>  is a diminutive of <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">yishrael<\/span>, Israel; expressing peculiar fondness and affection; <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u0399\u03c3\u03c1\u03b1\u03b7\u03bb\u03b9\u03b4\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd<\/span>, O little Israel.<\/p>",
