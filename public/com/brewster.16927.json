The Ten Tribes, or tribes of the northern kingdom of Israel, were taken into captivity by the Assyrians about 721 b.c. (See <a class=\"ref\">2 Kings 17<\/a>.) The return of these lost tribes, to receive their full blessings at the hands of Ephraim, is one of the basic beliefs of Latter-day Saints. (See <a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 133:26-34<\/a>; BICQ, 135-42.) Judah, while having gathered to the nation of Israel in a political or cultural sense, has yet to be gathered to the fold of the True Shepherd in fulfillment of the Lord's admonition to \"let them who be of Judah flee unto Jerusalem, unto the mountains of the Lord's house [His temples and His kingdom].\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 133:13<\/a>; BICQ, 125-34.)<\/p>",
