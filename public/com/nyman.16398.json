Paul quoted this passage with slightly different wording as evidence that the Gentiles were to receive the gospel. This wording also helps to identify the servant as Joseph Smith: \"And again, Esaias saith, There shall be a root of Jesse, and <i>he that shall rise<\/i> to <i>reign<\/i> over the <i>Gentiles;<\/i> in him shall the Gentiles trust\" (<a class=\"ref\">Rom. 15:12<\/a>).<\/p>     ",
