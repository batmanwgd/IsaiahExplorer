    "html": " <i>For all those things hath mine hand made, and those things have been.<\/i> The Lord created all things<i> <\/i>in heaven and on the earth. Other translations clarify the second phrase: \"by my hand all those things have been.\"<\/p> <p><i>to this man will I look.<\/i> The Lord has power over all, but he looks to a few with joy; he looks to a few to help him with his work. Those few are the obedient and contrite.<\/p> <p><i>poor and of a contrite spirit.<\/i> \"Blessed are the poor in spirit who come unto me,\" Jesus said, \"for theirs is the kingdom of heaven\" (<a class=\"ref\">3 Ne. 12:3<\/a>). A contrite spirit is often given as one of the principal requirements for receiving the saving grace of Christ (<a class=\"ref\">2 Ne. 2:7; Hel. 8:15<\/a>). A contrite spirit is penitent and sorrowful for sin. A <i>poor<\/i> spirit is a humble spirit. Those with a humble and a contrite spirit are those to whom the Lord will bring his greatest blessings.<\/p> <p><i>trembleth at my word.<\/i> The Lord is most pleased with those who desire to receive his word of revelation, both through his prophets and through the Holy Spirit, and who then are filled with awe, amazement, and reverence at that word. Those with such an attitude, of course, are those who love and obey the Lord's word with all their hearts.<\/p> ",
