    "html": "<p>In this chapter the Messiah is introduced, declaring the full extent of his commission, which is not only to be Savior to the Jews, but also to the Gentiles. The power and efficacy of his word is reprehended by apt images; the ill success of his ministry among the Jews is intimated, and the great success of the Gospel among the Gentiles, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODYzOCI6MTJ9\">Isaiah 49:1-12<\/a>.
