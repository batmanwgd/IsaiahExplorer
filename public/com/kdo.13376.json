    "html": "<p>What the prophet here foretells relates to all nations, and to every individual within them, in their relation to the congregation of Jehovah. He therefore commences with the appeal in <a class=\"ref\"><\/a>:<i>\u201cCome near, ye peoples, to hear; and he nations, attend. Let the earth hear, and that which fills it, the world, and everything that springs from it. For the indignation of Jehovah will fall upon all nations, and burning wrath upon all their host; He has laid the ban upon them, delivered them to the slaughter. And their slain are cast away, and their corpses - their stench will arise, and mountains melt with their blood.\u201d<\/i> The summons does not invite them to look upon the completion of the judgment, but to hear the prophecy of the future judgment; and it is issued to everything on the earth, because it would all have to endure the judgment upon the nations (see at <a class=\"ref\">;<\/a>). The expression (<span class=\"translit\"> qetseph layeho\u0304va\u0302h<\/span>) implies that Jehovah was ready to execute His wrath (compare (<span class=\"translit\"> yo\u0304m layeho\u0304va\u0302h<\/span>) in <a class=\"ref\"><\/a> and <a class=\"ref\"><\/a>). The nations that are hostile to Jehovah are slaughtered, the bodies remain unburied, and the streams of blood loosen the firm masses of the mountains, so that they melt away. On the stench of the corpses, compare <a class=\"ref\"><\/a>. Even if (<span class=\"translit\"> cha\u0302sam<\/span>), in this instance, does not mean \u201cto take away the breath with the stench,\u201d there is no doubt that Ezekiel had this prophecy of Isaiah in his mind, when prophesying of the destruction of Gog and Magog (Ezek 39). <br><\/p> ",
