    "html": "<p>&ldquo;Israel&rsquo;s rebellion is evidence of the highest degree of sin&rdquo; (Sidney B. Sperry, <em>The Spirit of the Old Testament,<\/em> p. 175). Jehovah had nourished and brought them up as children (in Egypt and the wilderness), and now in their adulthood (in the promised land) they had turned against the Lord. Their affliction is like wounds or sores that have not healed. The totality of their rebellion is illustrated by the references to head and heart, to the whole person from foot to head. In other words, the spiritual cancer had infested the whole body of Israel. Little spiritual health was left in the nation. That was why the land would be left utterly desolate.<\/p><p class=\"cite\"> LDS Church Educational System Old Testament Student Manual, 1 Kings&ndash;Malachi, Religion 302, Chapter 13, Item 3<\/p> ",
