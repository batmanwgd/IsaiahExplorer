Lucifer, because of his destructive and murderous acts, will not join the \"kings of the nations\" (14:18) who receive monumental tombs. Lucifer, of course, never received a body and therefore will never be buried.<\/p> <p><i>thou hast destroyed thy land.<\/i> Lucifer's code has always been war and destruction against both humanity and nature.<\/p> <p><i>slain thy people.<\/i> Lucifer uses men as instruments by tempting them to murder their fellow beings; Lucifer also leads people \"away unto destruction\" (<a class=\"ref\">Matt. 10:28; Alma 36:14<\/a>). In a sense, he slays their souls so they will suffer spiritual death.<\/p> <p><i>the seed of evildoers shall never be renowned.<\/i> Lucifer, or the king of Babylon, and others like them will not be honored or acclaimed in the eternities.<\/p> ",
