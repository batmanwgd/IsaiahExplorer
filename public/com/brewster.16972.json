This promise has been partially fulfilled as the kings and queens of the earth (those in positions of political power) have materially helped the dispersed return to their homelands. (See <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg2NTkiOjN9LHsiMzE4ODIiOjJ9LHsiMzE5OTIiOjJ9XQ==\">Isaiah 49:22-24; 2 Nephi 6:6-7; 10:8-9<\/a>; BICQ, 129 30.) However, the promise may also find fulfillment as heads of state open doors and break down barriers that have previously prevented the work of the Lord from moving forward.<\/p>",
