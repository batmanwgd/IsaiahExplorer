    "html": " <p> <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODM5XQ==\">Isa. 9<\/a> presents a messianic prophecy that is directly connected to the coronation and enthronement of Jesus (when Jesus is made King of kings). Kingship themes in this section include the victory of Jesus as the new king over oppressive kingdoms (9:4-5); the divine sonship of the new king (see commentary on 9:6; <a class=\"ref\">2 Sam. 7:11-16; Ps. 2<\/a>) the new king receives the government (9:6); the king receives names fitting for his kingship in a naming ceremony (9:6); the king becomes Father, God, and a member of the royal family, \"Prince of Peace\" (9:6); the king is given the throne and the kingdom (9:7); and the king rules forever with judgment, peace, and justice (9:7).<\/p> <p> Other themes presented in this section are called \"Davidic king motifs\"; they recall King David and his golden reign over Israel. This prophecy speaks of Jesus Christ, who is the last and greatest king from the house of David. The Davidic king motifs are the dawn of a great light (9:1-2; <a class=\"ref\">2 Sam. 23:4; Ps. 110:3<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\"> 118:24,  27<\/a>), rejoicing (9:3; <a class=\"ref\">Ps. 118:15,  24<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\"> 132:9,  16<\/a>), the overthrow of enemies (9:4; <a class=\"ref\">Ps. 2:8-9; 72:4<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\"> 89:23; 110:1<\/a>, <a class=\"ref\"> 5-6; 132:18<\/a>), burning with fire (9:5; <a class=\"ref\">2 Sam. 23:7; Ps. 21:9<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\"> 118:12<\/a>), and an eternal reign of the Lord (9:7; <a class=\"ref\">Ps. 21:4; 61:6<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\"> 89:3,  28-29<\/a>, <a class=\"ref\"> 36-<\/a> 37; 132:11-12). <\/p> <p>The prophetic setting and context of 9:3-7 primarily point to the millennial reign of Jesus Christ, although subthemes have appropriate applications in other settings. For instance, 9:6 refers to both Jesus' mortal birth and his millennial reign.<\/p> <p>Because Jesus Christ has become king, the nation's joy has increased (9:3), the people's yoke and burdens have been lifted and their oppressors removed (9:4), and there is no need for soldiers and other associations with war (9:5); the Prince of Peace (9:6) now reigns.<\/p> <p>The four royal names or titles given to Christ at the time of his investiture of authority and kingship\u2014wonderful Counsellor, mighty God, everlasting Father, and Prince of Peace (9:6)\u2014emphasize Jesus' ability to judge in righteousness, his godhood, his fatherhood, and his royal nature. The four names also recall the four parts inherent in the name of Isaiah's son Maher-shalal-hash-baz. The name <i>Maher-shalal- hash-baz<\/i> speaks of the judgments of God on Israel (8:1-4); the four names of Christ in 9:6 refer to the ultimate victory of the house of Israel because Jesus the Messiah has become King and God.<\/p> <p>It is valuable to observe the connections between the Immanuel prophecy (7:14- 17), its local fulfillment (8:3-7), and the fulfillment described in this section of Isaiah. All three sections pertain to similar events, including the birth of a son, his naming, oppression and its eventual removal, kings of the world as opposed to the new king, the destruction of the land so that peace may eventually prevail, God's role in mankind's history, and God's presence among the people (Immanuel = \"God is with us\"). Table 3 demonstrates the connections among the three sections (see the commentary on 7:10-16; see Tables 1 and 2, pages 73 and 74).<\/p> <table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" >
