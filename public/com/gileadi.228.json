    "html": "<p>When the Israelites conquered the Land of Canaan under the leadership of Moses and Joshua, Jehovah commanded them to slay men, women, and children because the iniquity of the Hivites, Amorites, Amalekites, Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, and Jebusites who dwelt there was full (<a class=\"ref\">Genesis 15:16; Exodus 23:23; Deuteronomy 3:6; Numbers 21:35<\/a>). Now that the iniquity of Jehovah&rsquo;s people themselves is full, they meet the same fate (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 1:4, 7; 26:21; 59:12-19<\/a>). Once Jehovah takes the righteous out from among them, the wicked left behind in the land fall prey to their enemies (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 57:1<\/a>).<\/p>",
