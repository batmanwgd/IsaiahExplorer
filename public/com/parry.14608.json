    "html": " <i> sacrifices\/burnt offerings.<\/i> In this passage Isaiah teaches that although a multitude of sacrifices are being offered, the hearts of the children of Israel are not given with their offerings, and thus their sacrifices are in vain and have no power to draw on the salvation of the Atonement. The emptiness of such offerings, offensive to God, results in condemnation (<a class=\"ref\">1 Sam. 15:22<\/a>). We are under the same condemnation when we observe the forms of our religion without yielding our hearts.<\/p> <p><i>fat\/blood.<\/i> The law of Moses provided specific instructions regarding the fat of the sacrificial victim (<a class=\"ref\">Lev. 3;  4<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\"> 7:23; 8:20<\/a>) and its blood (<a class=\"ref\">Lev. 4; 8:15<\/a>, <a class=\"ref\"> 19,  23-24<\/a>, <a class=\"ref\"> 30<\/a>). The meaning of the sacrifice, which pointed to Christ's atonement, were ignored, misunderstood, or misconstrued in Isaiah's time.<\/p> <p><i>rams\/beasts\/bullocks\/lambs\/goats.<\/i> Each of the sacrifices of the Mosaic temple system symbolically pointed to the ministry and atonement of Jesus Christ. Yet because this significance was not understood by the house of Israel, the sacrifices were no longer offered with real intent.<\/p> ",
