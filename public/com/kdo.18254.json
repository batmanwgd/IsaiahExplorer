    "html": "<p>(5)<\/p><p> After the long period governed by \u05dc\u05d5\u05bc\u05d0 has thus been followed by the retrospect in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODg5XQ==\">Isaiah 64:3<\/a> (4.), it is absolutely impossible that  (5<em> a<\/em> ) should be intended as an optative, in the sense of \u201cO that thou wouldst receive him that,\u201d etc., as Stier and others propose. The retrospect is still continued thus: <em> \u201cThou didst meet him that rejoiceth to work righteousness, when they remembered Thee in Thy ways.\u201d<\/em> \u05e6\u05d3\u05e7 \u05d5\u05e2\u05e9\u05c2\u05d4 \u05e9\u05c2\u05e9\u05c2 is one in whom joy and right action are paired, and is therefore equivalent to \u05dc\u05e2\u05e9\u05c2\u05d5\u05ea \u05e9\u05c2\u05e9\u05c2 . At the same time, it may possibly be more correct to take \u05e6\u05d3\u05e7 as the object of both verses, as Hofmann does in the sense of \u201cthose who let what is right be their joy, and their action also;\u201d for though \u05e9\u05c2\u05d5\u05bc\u05e9\u05c2 ( \u05e9\u05c2\u05d9\u05e9\u05c2 ) cannot be directly construed with the accusative of the object, as we have already observed at <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODE0XQ==\">Isaiah 8:6<\/a> and <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MzIyXQ==\">Isaiah 35:1<\/a>, it may be indirectly, as in this passage and <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4OTE2XQ==\">Isaiah 65:18<\/a>. On <em> pa\u0302ga\u201b <\/em> , \u201cto come to meet,\u201d in the sense of \u201ccoming to the help of,\u201d see at <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NjAzXQ==\">Isaiah 47:3<\/a>; it is here significantly interchanged with \u05d1\u05bc\u05d3\u05e8\u05db\u05d9 \u05da of the minor clause <em> bidra\u0302khekha\u0302 <\/em> <em> yizk e ru\u0304kha\u0302 <\/em> , \u201cthose who remember Thee in Thy ways\u201d (for the syntax, compare <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NjYwXQ==\">Isaiah 1:5<\/a> and <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTQ3XQ==\">Isaiah 26:16<\/a>): \u201cWhen such as love and do right, walking in Thy ways, remembered Thee (i.e., thanked Thee for grace received, and longed for fresh grace), Thou camest again and again to meet them as a friend.\u201d <\/p><p> But Israel appeared to have been given up without hope to the wrath of this very God.  (5<em> b<\/em> ). <em> \u201cBehold, Thou, Thou art enraged, and we stood as sinners there; already have we been long in this state, and shall we be saved?\u201d<\/em> Instead of <em> he\u0304n <\/em> <em> \u201b atta\u0302h <\/em> (the antithesis of now and formerly), the passage proceeds with <em> he\u0304n <\/em> <em> ' atta\u0302h <\/em> . There was no necessity for <em> ' atta\u0302h <\/em> with <em> qa\u0302tsaphta\u0302 <\/em> ; so that it is used with special emphasis: <em> \u201cBehold, Thou, a God who so faithfully accepts His own people, hast broken out in wrath.\u201d<\/em> The following word \u05d5\u05e0\u05bc\u05d7\u05d8\u05d0 cannot mean \u201cand we have sinned,\u201d but is a <em> fut. consec.<\/em> , and therefore must mean at least, \u201cthen we have sinned\u201d (the sin inferred from the punishment). It is more correct, however, to take it, as in <a class=\"ref\">Genesis 43:9<\/a>, in the sense of, \u201cThen we stand as sinners, as guilty persons:\u201d the punishment has exhibited Israel before the world, and before itself, as what it really is (consequently the <em> fut. consec.<\/em> does not express the logical inference, but the practical consequence). As \u05d5\u05e0\u05d7\u05d8\u05d0 has <em> tsakeph<\/em> , and therefore the accents at any rate preclude Shelling's rendering, \u201cand we have wandered in those ways from the very earliest times,\u201d we must take the next two clauses as independent, if indeed \u05d1\u05d4 \u05dd is to be understood as referring to \u05d1\u05d3\u05e8\u05db\u05d9 \u05da . Stier only goes halfway towards this when he renders it, \u201cAnd indeed in them (the ways of God, we sinned) from of old, and should we be helped?\u201d This is forced, and yet not in accordance with the accents. Rosenm\u00fcller and Hahn quite satisfy this demand when they render it, \u201c<em> Tamen in viis tuis aeternitas ut salvemur <\/em> ;\u201d but <em> \u201b o\u0304la\u0302m <\/em> , \u03b1\u03b9\u0313\u03c9\u0301\u03bd , in this sense of \u03b1\u03b9\u0313\u03c9\u03bd\u03b9\u03bf\u0301\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 , is not scriptural. The rendering adopted by Besser, Grotius, and Starck is a better one: \u201c(<em> Si vero <\/em> ) <em> in illis <\/em> (<em> viis<\/em> <em> tuis <\/em> ) <em> perpetuo <\/em> (<em> m ansissemus <\/em> ), <em> tunc servati fuerimus <\/em> \u201d (if we had continued in Thy ways, then we should have been preserved). But there is no succession of tenses here, which could warrant us in taking \u05d5\u05e0\u05d5\u05bc\u05e9\u05c1\u05e2 as a <em> paulo-post future;<\/em> and Hofmann's view is syntactically more correct, \u201cIn them (i.e., the ways of Jehovah) eternally, we shall find salvation, after the time is passed in which He has been angry and we have sinned\u201d (or rather, been shown to be guilty). But we question the connection between \u05d1\u05d4\u05dd and \u05e8\u05d3\u05db\u05d9\u05da in any form. In our view the prayer suddenly takes a new turn from <em> he\u0304n <\/em> (behold) onwards, just as it did with <em> lu\u0304' <\/em> (O that) in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODg3XQ==\">Isaiah 64:1<\/a>; and \u05e8\u05d3\u05db\u05d9\u05da in  stands at the head of a subordinate clause. Hence \u05d1\u05d4\u05dd must refer back to \u05d5\u05e0\u05d7\u05d8\u05d0 \u05e7\u05e6\u05e4\u05ea (\u201cin Thine anger and in our sins,\u201d Schegg). There is no necessity, however, to search for nouns to which to refer \u05d1\u05bc\u05d4\u05dd . It is rather to be taken as neuter, signifying \u201ctherein\u201d (<a class=\"ref\">Ezekiel 33:18<\/a>, cf., <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 90:10<\/a>), like \u05e2\u05dc\u05d9\u05d4\u05dd , thereupon = thereby (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDA3XQ==\">Isaiah 38:16<\/a>), \u05d1\u05bc\u05d4\u05df therein (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MzY5XQ==\">Isaiah 37:16<\/a>), \u05de\u05d4\u05dd thereout (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MjI0XQ==\">Isaiah 30:6<\/a>), therefrom (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NTQ5XQ==\">Isaiah 44:15<\/a>). The idea suggested by such expressions as these is no doubt that of plurality (here a plurality of manifestations of wrath and of sins), but one which vanishes into the neuter idea of totality. Now we do justice both to the clause without a verb, which, being a logical <em> copula <\/em> , admits simply of a present <em> sumus <\/em> ; and also to <em> \u201b o\u0304la\u0302m <\/em> , which is the accusative of duration, when we explain the sentence as meaning, \u201cIn this state we are and have been for a long time.\u201d <em> \u201b Ola\u0302m <\/em> is used in other instances in these prophecies to denote the long continuance of the sate of punishment (see <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDk1LDE4Nzc3XQ==\">Isaiah 42:14; Isaiah 57:11<\/a>), since it appeared to the exiles as an eternity (a whole aeon), and what lay beyond it as but a little while (<em> m its\u201ba\u0302r <\/em> , <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODg1XQ==\">Isaiah 63:18<\/a>). The following word \u05d5\u05e0\u05d5\u05bc\u05e9\u05c1\u05e2 needs no correction. There is no necessity to change it into \u05d5\u05e0\u05bc\u05ea\u05e2 , as Ewald proposes, after the lxx \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9\u0300 \u03b5\u0313\u03c0\u03bb\u03b1\u03bd\u03b7\u0301\u03b8\u03b7\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd (\u201cand we fell into wandering\u201d), or what would correspond still more closely to the lxx (cf., <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NTk1XQ==\">Isaiah 46:8<\/a>, \u05e4\u05e9\u05c1\u05e2\u05d9\u05dd , lxx \u03c0\u03b5\u03c0\u03bb\u03b1\u03bd\u03b7\u0301\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9 ), but is less appropriate here, into \u05d5\u05e0\u05bc\u05e4\u05e9\u05c1\u05e2 (\u201cand we fell into apostasy\u201d), the reading supported by Lowth and others. If it were necessary to alter the text at all, we might simply transpose the letters, and read \u05d5\u05bc\u05e0\u05e9\u05c1\u05d5\u05bc\u05e2 , \u201cand cried for help.\u201d But if we take it as a question, \u201cAnd shall we experience salvation - find help?\u201d there is nothing grammatically inadmissible in this (compare <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTkzXQ==\">Isaiah 28:28<\/a>), and psychologically it is commended by the state of mind depicted in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODQ0OF0seyIxODgxMSI6M31d\">Isaiah 40:27; Isaiah 59:10-12<\/a>. Moreover, what follows attaches itself quite naturally to this.<\/p>",
