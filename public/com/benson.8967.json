Perhaps the great day of atonement was especially intended. Bishop Lowth renders it, <i>the day of <\/i> <i>restraint,<\/i>, certain holy days, ordained by the law, being distinguished by a particular charge, that \u201cno servile work should be done therein.\u201d This circumstance clearly explains the reason of the name, <i>the restraint,<\/i>, given to those days. <\/p>",
