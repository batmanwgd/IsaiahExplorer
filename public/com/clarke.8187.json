But what is it that they shall know? The verb stands destitute of its object; and the sense is imperfect. The Chaldee is the only one, as far as I can find, that expresses it otherwise. He renders the verb in this place by<span class=\"greek-hebrew\"> \u05d5\u05d0\u05ea\u05e8\u05d1\u05e8\u05d1\u05d5<\/span><span class=\"translit\"> veithrabrabu<\/span> , \"they exalt themselves, or carry themselves haughtily; the same word by which he renders<span class=\"greek-hebrew\"> \u05d2\u05d1\u05d4\u05d5<\/span><span class=\"translit\"> gabehu<\/span> ,<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzI0XQ==\">Isaiah 3:16<\/a> . He seems, therefore, in this place to have read<span class=\"greek-hebrew\"> \u05d5\u05d9\u05d2\u05d1\u05d4\u05d5<\/span><span class=\"translit\"> vaiyigbehu<\/span> , which agrees perfectly well with what follows, and clears up the difficulty. Archbishop Secker conjectured<span class=\"greek-hebrew\"> \u05d5\u05d9\u05d3\u05d1\u05e8\u05d5<\/span><span class=\"translit\"> vayedabberu<\/span> , referring it to<span class=\"greek-hebrew\"> \u05dc\u05d0\u05de\u05e8<\/span><span class=\"translit\"> lemor<\/span> , in the next verse, which shows that he was not satisfied with the present reading. Houbigant reads<span class=\"greek-hebrew\"> \u05d5\u05d9\u05e8\u05e2\u05d5<\/span><span class=\"translit\"> vaiyereu<\/span> ,<i> et pravi facti sunt<\/i> , they are become wicked, which is found in a MS.; but I prefer the reading of the Chaldee, which suits much better with the context.<\/p> \n\n<p>Houbigant approves of this reading; but it is utterly unsupported by any evidence from antiquity: it is a mere mistake of<span class=\"greek-hebrew\"> \u05e8<\/span><span class=\"translit\"> resh<\/span> for<span class=\"greek-hebrew\"> \u05d3<\/span><span class=\"translit\"> daleth<\/span> ; and I am surprised that it should be favored by Houbigant.<\/p> ",
