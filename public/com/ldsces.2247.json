This phrase suggests that the condition mentioned in verse 1 is caused by the scarcity of men, a result of the devastation of war mentioned in<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzczMyI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 3:25&ndash;26<\/a> . The conditions under which these women would accept this marriage (&ldquo;eat our own bread, and wear our own apparel&rdquo;) are contrary to the Lord&rsquo;s order of marriage (see<a class=\"ref\">Exodus 21:10; D&amp;C 132:58&ndash;61<\/a>). To be unmarried and childless in ancient Israel was a disgrace (see<a class=\"ref\">Genesis 30:23; Luke 1:25<\/a>). So terrible would conditions in those times be that women would offer to share a husband with others and expect no material support from him, if they could claim they were married to him.<\/p><p class=\"cite\"> LDS Church Educational System Old Testament Student Manual, 1 Kings&ndash;Malachi, Religion 302, Chapter 13, Item 23<\/p> ",
