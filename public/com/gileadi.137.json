    "html": " <p>The term &ldquo;peace&rdquo;&mdash;a synonym of &ldquo;salvation&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzA0LDE4NzE3XQ==\">Isaiah 52:7; 53:5<\/a>)&mdash;alludes to the peace that ensues after a war to end all wars (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc4MzMiOjN9LHsiMTc5MzMiOjR9LHsiMTgyOTkiOjJ9LHsiMTg3MzMiOjl9XQ==\">vv 3-5; Isaiah 14:4-7; 33:19-20; 54:9-17<\/a>). Its parallelism with &ldquo;sovereignty&rdquo; recalls the title &ldquo;Prince of Peace&rdquo; (<em>sar-salom <\/em>) (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODM2XQ==\">v 6<\/a>). The attributes of &ldquo;justice and righteousness,&rdquo; which characterize the son&rsquo;s reign, typify the ministry of Jehovah&rsquo;s servant, the terms <em>righteousness <\/em> and <em>zeal <\/em> themselves designating the servant (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODE0MiwxODQ1NF0seyIxODQ4MiI6NH1d\">Isaiah 26:11; 41:2; 42:1-4<\/a>). Like King Hezekiah, he intercedes with Jehovah in seeking his people&rsquo;s peace or temporal salvation (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgzNjgiOjZ9LHsiMTgzODUiOjR9XQ==\">Isaiah 37:15-20, 32-35<\/a>). <\/p> <p>The servant&rsquo;s Davidic identity has similar parallels and word links: &ldquo;When oppressors are no more and violence has ceased, when tyrants are destroyed from the earth, then, in loving kindness, shall a throne be set up in the abode of David, and in faithfulness a judge sit on it who will maintain justice and expedite righteousness&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzk3NCI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 16:4-5<\/a>); &ldquo;Give ear and come unto me; pay heed, that your souls may live! And I will make with you an everlasting covenant: [my] loving fidelity toward David. See, I have appointed him as a witness to the nations, a prince and lawgiver of the peoples&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODc0NCI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 55:3-4<\/a>). <\/p> <p>Other Hebrew prophets, too, predict the millennial rule of a descendant of David named David who is not identical with Jehovah, Israel&rsquo;s divine King (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4Mjk3LDE4MzAyLDE4NTIxXQ==\">Isaiah 33:17, 22; 43:15<\/a>), but who prepares the way for Jehovah&rsquo;s coming (cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg0MjQiOjN9LFsxODcwNF1d\">Isaiah 40:3-5; 52:7<\/a>): &ldquo;They shall serve Jehovah their God and David their king, whom I will raise up to them&rdquo; (<a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 30:9<\/a>); &ldquo;I Jehovah will be their God, and my servant David a prince among them&rdquo; (<a class=\"ref\">Ezekiel 34:24<\/a>); &ldquo;David my servant shall be king over them, and they all shall have one shepherd.... and my servant David shall be their prince forever&rdquo; (<a class=\"ref\">Ezekiel 37:24-25<\/a>). <\/p> ",
