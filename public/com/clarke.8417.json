The city, beautifully situated on the top of a round hill, and surrounded immediately with a rich valley and a circle of other hills beyond it, suggested the idea of a chaplet or wreath of flowers worn upon their heads on occasions of festivity, expressed by the proud crown and the fading flower of the drunkards. That this custom of wearing chaplets in their banquets prevailed among the Jews, as well as among the Greeks and Romans, appears from the following passage of the book of The Wisdom of Solomon: - <\/p>\n\n <p>\"Let us fill ourselves with costly wine and ointments, <\/p>\n\n <p>And let no flower of the spring pass by us: <\/p>\n\n <p>Let us crown ourselves with rose-buds before they are withered.\" <\/p>\n\n <p>The <a href=\"\/\/www.studylight.org\/desk\/index.cgi?q1=Wisdom%20of%20Solomon+2:7&t1=en_nas\" id=\"18\" class=\"stL\" target=\"_blank\">, Wisdom of Solomon 2:7<\/a>, <a href=\"\/\/www.studylight.org\/desk\/index.cgi?q1=Wisdom%20of%20Solomon+2:8&t1=en_nas\" id=\"19\" class=\"stL\" target=\"_blank\">,8<\/a>. <\/p>",
