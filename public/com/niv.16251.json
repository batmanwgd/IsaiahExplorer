They made the fatal error of thinking that they were self-existent and self-perpetuating: \u201cI am, and there is none besides me\u201d (47:8, 10). It never occurred to them that they might be the agents of One infinitely greater than they who will hold them to account for their actions (47:7). But there is such a Person (cf. 43:10; 44:6; 45:5, 21; 46:8), and for Babylon to have tried to usurp his prerogatives was a deadly mistake.<\/p>         <p>\u2003Part of the deadliness of that mistake is complacency. Queen Babylon is so convinced of her ascendancy that she cannot imagine herself as a widow bereft of children (47:8\u20139). Her complacency robs her of that beneficial self-criticism that asks whether what we are doing may reap bad consequences. Babylon has none of that, so that \u201cwickedness\u201d runs rampant (47:10). Part of that wickedness is the attempt to control the spirit world through magic \u201cspells\u201d and \u201csorceries\u201d (47:9\u201311). The Babylonians were intelligent and devoted that intelligence to mastering magical arts, so they are sure that they can ward off any \u201ccalamity\u201d that threatens them. They do not reckon with a God who is beyond all magical manipulation, who is complete in himself, and who knows nothing of fate or destiny (cf. 65:11).<\/p>         ",
