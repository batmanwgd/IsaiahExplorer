    "html": "<p><em> \u201cAnd peoples in multitude go and say, Come, let us go up to the mountain of Jehovah, to the house of the God of Jacob; let Him instruct us out of His ways, and we will walk in His paths.\u201d<\/em> This is their signal for starting, and their song by the way (cf., <a class=\"ref\">Zechariah 8:21-22<\/a>). What urges them on is the desire for salvation. Desire for salvation expresses itself in the name they give to the point towards which they are travelling: they call Moriah \u201cthe mountain of Jehovah,\u201d and the temple upon it \u201cthe house of the God of Jacob.\u201d Through frequent use, <em> Israel<\/em> had become the popular name for the people of God; but the name they employ is the choicer name <em> Jacob<\/em> , which is the name of affection in the mouth of Micah, of whose style we are also reminded by the expression \u201cmany peoples\u201d (<em> ammim <\/em> <em> rabbim <\/em> ). Desire for salvation expresses itself in the object of their journey; they wish Jehovah to teach them <em> \u201cout of His ways,\u201d<\/em> - a rich source of instruction with which they desire to be gradually entrusted. The preposition <em> min<\/em> (out of, or from) is not partitive here, but refers, as in <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 94:12<\/a>, to the source of instruction. The \u201cways of Jehovah\u201d are the ways which God Himself takes, and by which men are led by Him - the revealed ordinances of His will and action. Desire for salvation also expresses itself in the resolution with which they set out: they not only wish to learn, but are resolved to act according to what they learn. <em> \u201cWe will walk in His paths:\u201d<\/em> the hortative is used here, as it frequently is (e.g., <a class=\"ref\">Genesis 27:4<\/a>, vid., Ges. <\/p>",
