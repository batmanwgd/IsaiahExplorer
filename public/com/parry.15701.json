The servant in this case seems to be Christ in the meridian of time. As the headnote to this chapter in the LDS edition to the Bible says, \"Isaiah speaks Messianically\u2014Messiah shall have the tongue of the learned.\" These verses also apply to Isaiah or to any true servant of the Lord who obeys despite persecution.<\/p> <p>The Lord enables the servant to speak and hear as a learned one does (50:4). This servant is faithful, \"not rebellious\" (50:5). He submits himself to the persecutions that come: \"I gave my back to the smiter&hellip;. I hid not my face from shame and spitting\" (50:6). He trusts in the Lord: \"The Lord God will help me,\" he says (50:7, 9). He knows that his life and ministry please the Lord: \"The Lord is near, and he justifieth me\" (50:8). At the same time, the servant knows that his enemies will not stand: \"I will smite him with the strength of my mouth&hellip;the moth shall eat them up\" (50:8, 9).<\/p> <p>This passage stands in contrast to earlier ones. Here, the servant receives the Lord's word (50:4); earlier, \"no man\" would listen (50:2). Here, the servant is confident in the Lord's help (50:7-9); earlier, the people doubted the Lord's love and power (49:14, 21). Here, the servant suffers because he is obedient (50:5-6); earlier, the people suffered because of their iniquities (50:1-3). Here, the servant is innocent of all charges (50:8-9), with the Lord supporting him; earlier, the Lord is an accuser and the people are guilty (50:1). Of course, we can and should be like the servant, rather than the sinful people; the servant is an example and model for us all.<\/p> <blockquote>The Lord God hath given <i>me<\/i> the <u>tongue of the learned<\/u>,     <br>that <i>I <\/i> should know <u>how to speak<\/u> a word in season [unto thee, O house of Israel.     <br>When ye are] weary     <br><i>he<\/i> [<u>waketh<\/u>] morning by morning.     <br><i>He<\/i> [<u>waketh<\/u>] mine ear to hear as the learned.
