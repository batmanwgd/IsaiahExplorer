Eaten\u2014That remnant shall be devoured a second time, by the kings of Syria, and afterwards by the Romans. Yet\u2014Yet there shall be another remnant, not such an one as that which came out of Babylon, but an holy seed, who shall afterwards look upon him whom they have pierced, and mourn over him. When\u2014Who when their leaves are cast in winter, have a substance within themselves, a vital principle, which preserves life in the root of the tree, and in due time sends it forth into all the branches. The support\u2014Of the land or people, which, were it not for the sake of these, should be finally rooted out.",
