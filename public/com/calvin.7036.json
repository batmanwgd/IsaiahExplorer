Not that he directs instruction to them, as if he hoped that it would be of any advantage, but, in foretelling what shall be their condition, he emphatically employs this form of direct address.<\/p> \n<p><i> For the day of the Lord is at hand.<\/i> He calls it<i> the day of the Lord<\/i> , according to the usual custom of Scripture, because when the Lord delays his judgment, he appears to cease from the discharge of his office, like judges when they do not ascend the judgment-seat. This mode of expression deserves notice, for we would gladly subject God to our disposal, that he might immediately pass sentence against the wicked. But he has his own appointed time, and knows the seasons when it is proper both to punish the bad and to assist the good.<\/p> \n<p><i> It shall come as destruction from the Strong One.<\/i> He threatens that the severity of judgment will be such that the inhabitants of<i> Babylon<\/i> will have good reason not only to<i> cry<\/i> but to<i> howl<\/i> ; because God displays his power to waste and destroy them.<span class=\"greek-hebrew\"> \u05e9\u05d3\u05d3<\/span> (<i> shadad<\/i>) signifies to<i> lay waste<\/i> and<i> plunder<\/i> . From this verb is derived<span class=\"greek-hebrew\"> \u05e9\u05d3\u05d9<\/span> , (<i> Shaddai<\/i> ,) one of the names of God, which some render<i> Almighty<\/i> . There is therefore an elegant allusion to the derivation of the word; as if he had said, that the inhabitants of Babylon shall learn by their own destruction how appropriately God is called<span class=\"greek-hebrew\"> \u05e9\u05d3\u05d9<\/span> , (<i> Shaddai<\/i> ,) that is,<i> strong<\/i> and<i> powerful<\/i> to destroy.<\/p> ",
