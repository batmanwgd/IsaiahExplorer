Jehovah&rsquo;s informing his servant of the approaching calamity spells hope for those who heed his summons (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTU1XQ==\">v 3<\/a>). Although Jehovah is a sanctuary for those who love him (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxNzgyMl0seyIxODEyMyI6Mn1d\">Isaiah 8:14; 25:4-5<\/a>), he doesn&rsquo;t hinder the searing <em>heat<\/em>&mdash;the archtyrant&rsquo;s destruction&mdash;from overtaking the wicked (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc4NDgiOjJ9LHsiMTgyOTQiOjN9XQ==\">Isaiah 9:18-19; 33:14-16<\/a>).<\/p>",
