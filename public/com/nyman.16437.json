There is to be a group in the midst of the land (the earth) who shall sing unto the Lord and glorify him. He further identifies the place as \"in the fires... in the isles of the sea.\" A marginal note in the KJV suggests the word \"valleys\" instead of \"fires.\" Isaiah consistently uses the term \"isles of the sea,\" undoubtedly with reference to America. Similarly, the Book of Mormon prophet Jacob spoke of the Nephites' being on \"an isle of the sea\" (<a class=\"ref\">2 Ne. 10:20<\/a>). Thus Isaiah seems to be describing the Latter-day Saints, who will be singing and glorifying God in the day of the earth's turmoils and devastation.<\/p>     ",
