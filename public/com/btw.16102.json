Isaiah continues, \"for he was cut off out of the land of the living.\" Isaiah answers the question later in verse 10, where he declares that after his death, \"he shall see his seed.\"  <\/p>  <p>  <b>Mosiah 14:9. \"His grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death\"<\/b> We remember that Jesus was crucified between two thieves and was laid to rest in the borrowed tomb of a wealthy man, Joseph of Arimathea (see John 19:38\u201342).  <\/p>  ",
