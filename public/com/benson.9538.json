    "html": "<p><a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 59:7-8<\/a>.<i>Their feet run to evil <\/i>\u2014 This seems to be taken from <a class=\"ref\">Proverbs 1:16<\/a>; where see the note. He had spoken of their hands, fingers, lips, tongues, &c., before, and now he speaks of their feet, to show that they were wholly set upon mischief. <i>Their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity <\/i>\u2014 Their minds and hearts are wholly set upon committing wickedness, and doing injuries: they not only do evil, but do it deliberately. <i>Wasting and destruction are in their paths <\/i>\u2014 In what way or work soever they are engaged, it all tends to ruin and destruction. It is a metaphor taken from an overspreading torrent, or sweeping plague, or from beasts of prey, that tear and devour whatever comes in their way. <i>The way of peace they know not <\/i>\u2014 They live in continual contentions and discords, and break in pieces the very bonds of society. <i>And there is no judgment <\/i>\u2014 No justice, equity, faith, or integrity, which are the foundation of judgment; <i>in their goings <\/i>\u2014 In their conduct or actions. <i>They have made them crooked paths<\/i> \u2014 They have turned aside from the way of God\u2019s commandments, which are a plain and straight way, into the crooked and winding paths of craft, subtlety, and selfishness. <i>Whosoever goeth therein shall know no peace <\/i>\u2014 Shall experience none. Whosoever shall do as they do, and be turbulent and perverse as they are, will have as little peace within, or happiness without, as they have.<\/p>",
