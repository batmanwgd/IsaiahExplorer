With her strength gone, the earth is no longer able to bring forth fruit as she once had, a curse that has been associated with sin since the world's beginning (<a class=\"ref\">Gen. 3:17-<\/a> 19). This in turn affects all who dwell on the earth\u2014human beings, animals, and vegetables (24:7; 40:7-8; <a class=\"ref\">Hosea 4:3<\/a>; JST <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODkyXQ==\">Isa. 64:6<\/a>). The earth mourns and withers both from judgment and from apostasy.<\/p> <p><i>the haughty people of the earth do languish. <\/i>In the last days, the proud will languish, or droop, under the weight of their sins (10:33; 13:11; <a class=\"ref\">Prov. 16:18<\/a>). <\/p> ",
