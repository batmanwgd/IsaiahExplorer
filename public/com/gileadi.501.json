    "html": "<p>The creation motif of Jehovah as Creator-King (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzAxXQ==\">v 15<\/a>) resumes with the exodus of Jehovah&rsquo;s people out of Greater Babylon (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzAyXQ==\">v 16<\/a>) at the center of the chaos-creation pattern. The forces of chaos&mdash;notably the archtyrant who personifies the <em>Sea<\/em> and &ldquo;mighty waters&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxNzgxNV0seyIxNzk5NiI6Mn0sWzE4MTY3XV0=\">Isaiah 8:7; 17:12-13; 28:2<\/a>)&mdash;are subdued to let Jehovah&rsquo;s elect pass through (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc5MDAiOjJ9LHsiMTg2ODQiOjJ9LHsiMTg4NzgiOjN9XQ==\">Isaiah 11:15-16; 51:10-11; 63:11-13<\/a>). Just as Israel&rsquo;s deliverance from Egypt wasn&rsquo;t complete until Pharaoh&rsquo;s armies had drowned in the sea (<a class=\"ref\">Exodus 15:1-4<\/a>), so the end-time deliverance of Jehovah&rsquo;s people isn&rsquo;t complete until their enemies are &ldquo;snuffed out.&rdquo;<\/p><p>The exodus of Jehovah&rsquo;s elect out of Greater Babylon&mdash;out of all the world at the time of its desolation (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxNzkwOCwxNzkxNiwxNzkxOF0seyIxODYzNSI6Mn0seyIxODcwOCI6Mn1d\">Isaiah 13:1, 9, 11; 48:20-21; 52:11-12<\/a>)&mdash;quintessentially expresses Jehovah&rsquo;s redemption of his people. As ancient Israel was born as a nation following its exodus out of Egypt&mdash;covenanting with Jehovah in the wilderness to be his people and he their God (<a class=\"ref\">Exodus 19:5-8<\/a>)&mdash;so, as a result of the servant&rsquo;s mission, they are reborn as his covenant people following the new exodus. In that great reversal of circumstances those who didn&rsquo;t respond to the servant&rsquo;s mission, whose light remains dim, perish.<\/p>",
