If we were disposed to cavil, we might bring the same charge against them. For a few weeks ago, \"a beautiful altar-piece, painted and presented by the lady of major general Cheney, was put in Horn-sea church, representing Christ blessing the bread and wine.\" But Protestants can confine such things to their proper use, and Catholic must adore them.
