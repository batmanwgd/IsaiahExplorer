While relying upon this, Israel received strokes, because Jehovah made Israel's staff into its rod. But henceforth it would sanctify the Holy One of Israel, putting its trust in Him and not in man, and that purely and truly (<em> be'emeth <\/em> , \u201cin truth\u201d), not with fickleness and hypocrisy.
