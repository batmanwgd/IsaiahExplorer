While some scholars dispute this, saying that there is really no answer to the charge that God has been silent, the fact is God answers the real issue: the continuing rebellion of the people. They have sought to placate God with a reliance on cult and liturgy that is as offensive to him as any of the pagan worship. They have relied on their status as the elect of God while continuing to live lives of self-willed, self-serving sin. They call themselves the \u201cservants of God,\u201d but they are not.<\/p>     ",
