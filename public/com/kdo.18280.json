    "html": "<p> Jehovah appears with these warlike terrors because He is coming for a great judgment. <em> \u201cFor in the midst of fire Jehovah holds judgment, and in the midst of His sword with all flesh; and great will be the multitude of those pierced through by Jehovah.\u201d<\/em> The fire, which is here introduced as the medium of judgment, points to destructive occurrences of nature, and the sword to destructive occurrences of history. At the same time all the emphasis is laid here, as in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODMwOSI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 34:5-6<\/a> (cf., <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTUzXQ==\">Isaiah 27:1<\/a>), upon the direct action of Jehovah Himself. The parallelism in  is progressive. <em> Nishpat <\/em> <em> 'e\u0304th <\/em> , \u201cto go into judgment with a person,\u201d as in <a class=\"ref\">Ezekiel 38:22<\/a> (cf., \u05e2\u05dd in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxNzcyMiwyMjM0NiwxMTY1M10seyIxMTE5NiI6MTd9LHsiMjU0MzciOjJ9XQ==\">Isaiah 3:14, Joel 3:2; 2 Chronicles 22:8; \u03bc \u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u0301 , Luke 11:31-32<\/a>). We find a resemblance to  in <a class=\"ref\">Zephaniah 2:12<\/a>, and this is not the only resemblance to our prophecy in that strongly reproductive prophet.<\/p>",
