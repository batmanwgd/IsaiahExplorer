    "html": "          <p>The traditional interpretation of these verses is that they describe Christ. This is supported by pas sages in the book of Revelation (2:16; 19:15) and the Doctrine and Covenants (19:15; 113:1-2), and by President Joseph Fielding Smith (see DS, 1:168). Nephi quotes verses 4 through 9 (see <a class=\"ref\">2 Ne. 30:9-15<\/a>), clearly indicating that verses 4 and 5 describe \"the Lord God.\" There is one verse inserted be tween verses 4 and 5 (<a class=\"ref\">2 Ne. 30:10<\/a>) which appears to be Nephi's comment. There are also three verses following verse 9 which are not in the KJV (<a class=\"ref\">2 Ne. 30:16-18<\/a>).<\/p>     <p><a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzg4NyI6NH0=\">Isaiah 11:2-5<\/a> must be understood within the context established in verse 1, including the \"rod\" (servant) mentioned there, and verses 2 through 4 especially may refer to Joseph Smith. \"The spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him.\" As <a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 5:6-10<\/a> clearly points out, Joseph Smith was chosen to give the Lord's word to this generation. These verses may have a double reference to both Christ and Joseph Smith. (Isaiah uses double references in other passages as well; for example, see note on 52:13-15.) After all, the servant was to be an instrument in the hands of Christ to carry out his work. As the Spirit of the Lord came upon Joseph Smith, he did attain wisdom, understanding, and knowledge; further, Joseph did judge in righteousness through the Spirit of the Lord.<\/p>     ",
