    "html": "<p> In this v. a disputed question arises as to the words \u05e2\u05dc\u05be\u05de\u05d4 ( \u05de\u05d4 , the shorter, sharper form of \u05de\u05d4 , which is common even before non-gutturals, Ges. \u00a732, 1): viz., whether they mean \u201cwherefore,\u201d as the lxx, Targums, Vulgate, and most of the early versions render them, or \u201cupon what,\u201d i.e., upon which part of the body, as others, including Schr\u00f6ring, suppose. Luzzatto maintains that the latter rendering is spiritless, more especially because there is nothing in the fact that a limb has been struck already to prevent its being struck again; but such objections as these can only arise in connection with a purely literal interpretation of the passage. If we adopted this rendering, the real meaning would be, that there was no judgment whatever that had not already fallen upon Israel on account of its apostasy, so that it was not far from utter destruction. We agree, however, with Caspari in deciding in favour of the meaning \u201cto what\u201d (to what end). For in all the other passage in which the expression occurs (fourteen times in all), it is used in this sense, and once even with the verb <em> hicca\u0302h <\/em> , to smite (<a class=\"ref\">Numbers 22:32<\/a>), whilst it is only in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NjYxXQ==\">Isaiah 1:6<\/a> that the idea of the people as one body is introduced; whereas the question \u201cupon what\u201d would require that the reader or hearer should presuppose it here. But in adopting the rendering \u201cwhereto,\u201d or to what end, we do not understand it, as Malbim does, in the sense of <em> Cui bono <\/em> , with the underlying thought, \u201cIt would be ineffectual, as all the previous smiting has proved;\u201d for this thought never comes out in a direct expression, as we should expect, but rather - according to the analogy of the questions with <em> lamah <\/em> in <a class=\"ref\">Ezekiel 18:31; Jeremiah 44:7<\/a> -in the sense of <em> qua de causa <\/em> , with the underlying thought, \u201cThere would be only an infatuated pleasure in your own destruction.\u201d <\/p><p> we therefore render thus: <em> \u201cWhy would ye be perpetually smitten, multiplying rebellion?\u201d<\/em> \u05e2\u05d5\u05d3 (with <em> tiphchah<\/em> , a stronger disjunctive than <em> tebir <\/em> ) belongs to \u05ea\u05bc\u05db\u05bc\u05d5\u05bc ; see the same form of accentuation in <a class=\"ref\">Ezekiel 19:9<\/a>. They are not two distinct interrogative clauses (\u201cwhy would ye be smitten afresh? why do ye add revolt?\u201d (Luzzatto), but the second clause is subordinate to the first (without there being any necessity to supply <em> C hi <\/em> , <em> \u201cbecause,\u201d<\/em> as Gesenius supposes), an adverbial minor clause defining the main clause more precisely; at all events this is the logical connection, as in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzUxXQ==\">Isaiah 5:11<\/a> (cf., <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 62:4<\/a>, \u201cdelighting in lies,\u201d and <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 4:3<\/a>, \u201cloving vanity\u201d): lxx \u201cadding iniquity.\u201d <em> Sa\u0302ra\u0302h <\/em> (rebellion) is a deviation from truth and rectitude; and here, as in many other instances, it denotes apostasy from Jehovah, who is the absolutely Good, and absolute goodness. There is a still further dispute whether the next words should be rendered \u201cevery head\u201d and \u201cevery heart,\u201d or \u201cthe whole head\u201d and \u201cthe whole heart.\u201d In prose the latter would be impossible, as the two nouns are written without the article; but in the poetic style of the prophets the article may be omitted after <em> Col <\/em> , when used in the sense of \u201cthe whole\u201d (e.g., <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODQyXQ==\">Isaiah 9:12<\/a> : with <em> whole<\/em> mouth, i.e., with full mouth). Nevertheless <em> Col <\/em> , without the article following, never signifies \u201cthe whole\u201d when it occurs several times in succession, as in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3OTYzXQ==\">Isaiah 15:2<\/a> and <a class=\"ref\">Ezekiel 7:17-18<\/a>. We must therefore render  , <em> \u201cEvery head is diseased, and every heart is sick.\u201d<\/em> The <em> Lamed<\/em> in <em> locholi <\/em> indicates the state into which a thing has come: every head in a state of disease (Ewald, \u00a7217, <em> d:<\/em> <em> locholi <\/em> without the article, as in <a class=\"ref\">2 Chronicles 21:18<\/a>). The prophet asks his fellow-countrymen why they are so foolish as to heap apostasy upon apostasy, and so continue to call down the judgments of God, which have already fallen upon them blow after blow. Has it reached such a height with them, that among all the many heads and hearts there is not one head which is not in a diseased state, not one heart which is not thoroughly ill? (<em> davvai <\/em> an emphatic form of <em> daveh <\/em> ). Head and heart are mentioned as the noblest parts of the outer and inner man. Outwardly and inwardly every individual in the nation had already been smitten by the wrath of God, so that they had had enough, and might have been brought to reflection.<\/p>",
