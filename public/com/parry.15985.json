But they are assured that the promise will indeed come to pass and that a seed of Jacob will inherit the mountains of Palestine (14:25; 57:13; 60:21). Because mountains often symbolize temples, this passage seems to indicate that the covenant people will receive the blessings of the temple.<\/p> <p><i>mine elect\/my servants.<\/i> The elect of God are those Saints who are faithful and true (<a class=\"ref\">Col. 3:12-13; D&amp;C 29:7<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\"> 33:6; 35:20<\/a>). They are justified by Christ and will come to his glory (<a class=\"ref\">Rom. 8:28-30<\/a>). <i>Mine elect<\/i> and <i>my servants<\/i> are synonymous (45:4).
