    "html": " <i>A <\/i><b> <\/b><i>bruised reed shall he not break&hellip;smoking flax shall he not quench. <\/i>A reed is a marsh plant with tall, hollow stems. A bruised reed is one that is cracked, and therefore is weak. Symbolically, a <i>bruised reed<\/i> may be a mortal with physical weaknesses or bodily afflictions. A <i>smoking flax<\/i> is a wick made from flax for an oil lamp, whose flame wavers, about to go out. This may signify someone who is spiritually weak, whose light flickers and does not burn brightly. Jesus healed and cared for the physically infirm (bruised reed), and he taught and guided the spiritually weak (smoking flax). A reed requires much water for it to grow properly; a flax or wick burns brightly when it has sufficient oil. Symbolically, Jesus Christ (as the waters of life) provides water to the reed, and (as the Anointed One) provides oil to the wick.<\/p> <p><i>judgment unto truth. <\/i>The New International Version reads: \"In faithfulness he will bring forth justice.\" The passage is difficult in this context, but it may refer to the Day of Judgment (see <a class=\"ref\">Matt. 12:20<\/a>), when the Lord will be victorious and establish truth in his kingdom on the earth (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 52:11<\/a>). <\/p> ",
