    "html": " <p><i>Latter-day Saints love to worship the Lord through singing hymns, and we do so on many occasions, such as at sacrament meetings, general conference, and baptisms. Isaiah, some seven hundred years before Christ, provided the words of a hymn (25:1- 5) that the righteous will sing after Jesus Christ destroys wickedness and corruption from off the face of the earth at his second coming. The words of the hymn should give us hope for the future as well as build our faith in him.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>The second part of this chapter introduces us to a great sacred feast that will be prepared by the Lord (25:6-12). This feast is the supper of the Lord, or the Bridegroom, which will be attended by all the righteous.<\/i><\/p> ",
