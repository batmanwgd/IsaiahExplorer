    "html": "<p>(6)<\/p><p> The people who ask the question in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODkxXQ==\">Isaiah 64:5<\/a> do not regard themselves as worthy of redemption, as their self-righteousness has been so thoroughly put to shame. <em> \u201cWe all became like the unclean thing, and all our virtues like a garment soiled with blood; and we all faded away together like the leaves; and our iniquities, like the storm they carried us away.\u201d<\/em> The whole nation is like one whom the law pronounces unclean, like a leper, who has to cry \u201c<em> ta\u0302me\u0304 <\/em> , <em> ta\u0302me\u0304 <\/em> \u201cas he goes along, that men may get out of his way (<a class=\"ref\">Leviticus 13:45<\/a>). Doing right in all its manifold forms (<em> ts e da\u0302qo\u0304th <\/em> , like <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4Mjk1XQ==\">Isaiah 33:15<\/a>, used elsewhere of the manifestations of divine righteousness), which once made Israel well-pleasing to God (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3Njc2XQ==\">Isaiah 1:21<\/a>), has disappeared and become like a garment stained with menstruous discharge (cf., <a class=\"ref\">Ezekiel 36:17<\/a>); (lxx \u03c9\u0314\u03c2 \u03c1\u0314\u03b1\u0301\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2 \u03b1\u0313\u03c0\u03bf\u03ba\u03b1\u03b8\u03b7\u03bc\u03b5\u0301\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2 = <em> da\u0302va\u0302 <\/em> , <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MjQwXQ==\">Isaiah 30:22<\/a>; <em> nidda\u0302h <\/em> , <a class=\"ref\">Lamentations 1:17<\/a>; <em> t e me\u0304'a\u0302h <\/em> , <a class=\"ref\">Leviticus 15:33<\/a>). <em> \u201bIdd\u0131\u0304m <\/em> (used thus in the plural in the Talmud also) signifies the monthly period (<em> menstrua <\/em> ). In the third figure, that of fading falling foliage, the form <em> vanna\u0302bhel <\/em> is not <em> kal<\/em> (= <em> vannibbo\u0304l <\/em> or <em> vannibbal <\/em> ; Ewald, \u00a7232,<em> b<\/em> ), which would be an impossibility according to the laws of inflexion; still less is it <em> niphal<\/em> = <em> vanninna\u0302bhel <\/em> (which Kimchi suggests as an alternative); but certainly a <em> hiphil<\/em> . It is not, however, from <em> na\u0302bhe\u0304l <\/em> = <em> vannabbel <\/em> , \u201cwith the reduplication dropped to express the idea of something gradual,\u201d as B\u00f6ttcher proposes (a new and arbitrary explanation in the place of one founded upon the simple laws of inflexion), but either from <em> ba\u0302lal <\/em> (compare the remarks on <em> bel\u0131\u0304l <\/em> in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MjQyXQ==\">Isaiah 30:24<\/a>, which hardly signifies \u201cripe barley\u201d however), after the form \u05d5\u05d9\u05bc\u05d2\u05dc (from \u05d2\u05bc\u05dc\u05dc ) \u05d5\u05d9\u05bc\u05e1 \u05da (from \u05e1\u05db \u05da ), or from <em> bu\u0304l <\/em> , after the form \u05d5\u05d9\u05bc\u05e7\u05dd , etc. In any case, therefore, it is a metaplastic formation, whether from <em> ba\u0302lal <\/em> or <em> bu\u0304l <\/em> = <em> na\u0302bhe\u0304l <\/em> , like \u05d5\u05d9\u05bc\u05e9\u05c2\u05e8 (in <a class=\"ref\">1 Chronicles 20:3<\/a>, after the form \u05d5\u05d9\u05bc\u05e1\u05e8 , from \u05e9\u05bc\u05c2\u05d5\u05e8 = \u05e0\u05e9\u05c2\u05e8 , or after the form \u05d5\u05d9\u05bc\u05e8\u05e2 , from \u05e9\u05c2\u05e8\u05e8 = \u05e0\u05e9\u05c2\u05e8 (compare the rabbinical explanation of the name of the month Bul from the falling of the leaves, in Buxtorf, <em> Lex. talm.<\/em> col. 271). The <em> hiphil<\/em> \u05d4\u05d1\u05dc or \u05d4\u05d1\u05d9\u05dc is to be compared to \u05d4\u05d0\u05d3\u05d9\u05dd , to stream out red (= to be red); \u05d4\u05d0\u05e8\u05d9 \u05da , to make an extension (= to be long); \u05d4\u05e9\u05c1\u05e8\u05d9\u05e9\u05c1 , to strike root (= to root), etc., and signifies literally to produce a fading (= to fade away). In the fourth figure, \u05e2\u05d5\u05e0\u05e0\u05d5\u05bc (as it is also written in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODkyXQ==\">Isaiah 64:6<\/a> according to correct codices) is a defective plural (as in <a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 14:7; Ezekiel 28:18; Daniel 9:13<\/a>) for the more usual \u05e2\u05d5\u05e0\u05ea\u05d9\u05e0\u05d5\u05bc (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODEzXQ==\">Isaiah 59:12<\/a>). \u05e2\u05d5\u05df is the usual term applied to sin regarded as guilt, which produces punishment of itself. The people were robbed by their sins of all vital strength and energy, like dry leaves, which the guilt and punishment springing from sin carried off as a very easy prey.<\/p>",
