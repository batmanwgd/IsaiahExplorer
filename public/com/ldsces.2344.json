    "html": "<p>&ldquo;The prophet confronts the rulers of Jerusalem with the assertion that their policy and behavior are bringing inevitable ruin. This time the fault is that they have deliberately entered into a covenant to serve, in return for protection, a god or gods other than their own. Death,<em>maweth,<\/em> is here the god of the underworld, Sheol or hell. Perhaps the Canaanite god of the underworld, Mot, is intended, or the reference may be to the Egyptian Osiris. It was customary for the prophets to speak of the alien deities as lies and falsehood (compare<a class=\"ref\">Amos 2:4; Jer. 10:14<\/a>). In contrast to this act of panic by the rulers, Isaiah declares that faith in God is the only secure foundation of Zion&rsquo;s security, and that his justice and righteousness alone can erect a building that will stand. Those who in fright have sought to secure themselves by worshiping other gods as well, will experience in sheer terror the effects of Yahweh&rsquo;s decree of destruction.&rdquo; (<em>The Interpreter&rsquo;s Bible,<\/em> 5:317.)<\/p><p>Of course, the phrase may have a spiritual meaning as well. Israel made a covenant with death because that is what &ldquo;the wages of sin&rdquo; are&mdash;death (<a class=\"ref\">Romans 6:23<\/a>).<\/p><p>For other references to the overflowing scourge in modern times, see<a class=\"ref\">Doctrine and Covenants 29:17&ndash;19; 45:31; 84:96&ndash;97; 97:22&ndash;26; 105:15<\/a> .<\/p><p class=\"cite\"> LDS Church Educational System Old Testament Student Manual, 1 Kings&ndash;Malachi, Religion 302, Chapter 15, Item 12<\/p> ",
