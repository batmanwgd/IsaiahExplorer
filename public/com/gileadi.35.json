    "html": " <p>A transitional verse between the previous passage and what follows, it addresses the Jacob\/Israel category of Jehovah&rsquo;s people. If they repent and follow Jehovah&rsquo;s light, they may qualify for the new exodus of his people to Zion and escape the destruction that engulfs the world. Jehovah&rsquo;s &ldquo;light&rdquo; has three applications, which follow each other consecutively. First are Jehovah&rsquo;s law and precepts: &ldquo;The law shall go forth from me; my precepts shall be a light to the peoples. Then, suddenly, I will act: My <em>righteousness <\/em> shall be at hand and my <em>salvation <\/em> proceed&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODY3OCI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 51:4-5<\/a>; emphasis added). <\/p> <p>Jehovah&rsquo;s servant and forerunner&mdash;his <em>righteousness <\/em> (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDU0XQ==\">Isaiah 41:2<\/a>)&mdash;follows next: &ldquo;I have created you and appointed you to be a <em>covenant <\/em> for the people, a <em>light <\/em> to the nations&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDg3XQ==\">Isaiah 42:6<\/a>; emphasis added; cf. 62:1); &ldquo;It is too small a thing for you to be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob and to restore those preserved of Israel. I will also appoint you to be a <em>light <\/em> to the nations, that my <em>salvation <\/em> may be to the end of the earth&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NjQzXQ==\">Isaiah 49:6<\/a>; emphasis added). Lastly, in the millennial age, &ldquo;Jehovah will be an endless <em>Light <\/em> when your days of mourning are fulfilled&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODQyXQ==\">Isaiah 60:20<\/a>; emphasis added). <\/p> ",
