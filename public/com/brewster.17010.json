The nation was home of the Philistines, detested enemies of Judah and the Israelites. This country was at the height of its power at the time of King Saul's death, but declined during the reign of King David. The Philistines were conquered by the Assyrians in 734 b.c., later they became part of the Persian Empire, and finally the land was annexed to Syria by the Romans. \"Strangely enough the name of the territory of these detested enemies of the Jews has become one familiar title (Palestine) for the whole of the Holy Land.\" (LDSBD, \"Philistines,\" 751.)<\/p>",
