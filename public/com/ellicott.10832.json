In this case the armies are thought of as doing the work of Jehovah Sabaoth, and therefore as being summoned by Him. The same image meets us in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 11:10<\/a>; <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 11:12<\/a>; <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 13:2<\/a>; <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 18:3<\/a>; <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 49:22<\/a>; <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 62:10<\/a>.<\/p>\n <p>Will hiss unto them.\u2014The verb meets us in a like context in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 7:18<\/a>. It seems to describe the sharp shrill whistle which was to the ear what the banner was to the eye, the signal of a rendezvous. Possibly, as in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 7:18<\/a>, the idea of the bees swarming at the whistling of the bee-master is already in the prophet\u2019s thoughts.<\/p>\n <p>From the end of the earth.\u2014The words point to the Assyrians, the Euphrates being the boundary of Isaiah\u2019s political geography.<\/p>",
