This term represents those who are more concerned with selfish and sensual desires than with the needs of others or with God (<a class=\"ref\">Luke 8:14; 2 Tim. 3:4<\/a>). <\/p> <p><i>carelessly<\/i>. This word means without care for what God desires or requires (<a class=\"ref\">Ezek. 39:6<\/a>). <\/p> <p><i>I am, and none else beside me<\/i>. This statement is something God says of himself (45:5-6, 18, 21-22; <a class=\"ref\">Ex. 3:13-14<\/a>). Now Babylon (or the wicked world) is saying it of herself, suggesting she needs no God and is independent and self-sufficient (<a class=\"ref\">Zeph. 2:15<\/a>). By saying \"I am,\" Babylon is also saying, \"I am God.\"<\/p> <p><i>not sit as a widow\/neither shall I know the loss of children<\/i>. Babylon feels secure: she is convinced she will never lose her source of strength (husband) or continuance (children; see <a class=\"ref\">Rev. 18:7-8<\/a>). Similarly, the loss of husband (bridegroom) and children symbolize the loss of the Abrahamic covenant. Some self-sufficient but unworthy Church members feel they are exempt from God's judgments.<\/p> ",
