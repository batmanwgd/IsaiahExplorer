It flies fast and straight, never varying. The promised Servant (Christ) was absolutely true and never varied from His appointed target or work. He was surely polished in the furnace of affliction. It should be noted that Joseph Smith did refer to himself as \"a smooth and polished shaft in the quiver of the Almighty.\" (TPJS, 304.) Certainly he too was true to his assigned mission.<\/p>",
