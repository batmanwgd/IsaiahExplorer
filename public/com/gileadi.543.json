    "html": "<p>By paralleling chapters 13-23 with chapter 47, Part IV of Isaiah&rsquo;s Seven-Part Structure ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODYwMSI6MTV9\">Isaiah 13-23; 47<\/a>) establishes the concept of a<em>composite<\/em> entity identified as Babylon&mdash;a kind of Greater Babylon that resembles John&rsquo;s &ldquo;Babylon the Great&rdquo; ( <a class=\"ref\">Revelation 17:5<\/a>). From being &ldquo;Mistress of Kingdoms&rdquo; ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODYwNSI6NH0=\">vv 5-8<\/a>), who rules the nations of the world, her lot is now to be a slave girl. Her lording it over Jehovah&rsquo;s people ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NjA2XQ==\">v 6<\/a>) has led to her descent into the dust. A chaos motif, &ldquo;dust&rdquo; signifies her final state as she is reduced to a nonentity in Jehovah&rsquo;s Day of Judgment ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxNzkyNl0seyIxNzk1MSI6Mn0sWzE4MDQ1XSx7IjE4MDkwIjoyfV0=\">Isaiah 13:19; 14:22-23; 21:9; 23:12-13<\/a>).<\/p><p>Although the world touts her as &ldquo;delicate and refined&rdquo;&mdash;as she typifies the height of culture and sophistication&mdash;the idolatrous and oppressive establishment Babylon represents is the opposite of Zion&rsquo;s. Isaiah&rsquo;s Seven-Part Structure juxtaposes the two. This &ldquo;Virgin Daughter of Babylon&rdquo;&mdash;a new, end-time Babylon&mdash;is in reality a whore whose tyranny, like that of the evil stepmother of fairy tales, finally comes to an end: &ldquo;And Babylon, the most splendid of kingdoms, the glory and pride of Chaldeans, shall be [thrown down] as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah&rdquo; ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3OTI2XQ==\">Isaiah 13:19<\/a>; cf. <a class=\"ref\">Revelation 18:2<\/a>).<\/p> ",
