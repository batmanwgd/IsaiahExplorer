    "html": "<p>As we learn from Hezekiah&rsquo;s account of his illness, his desire was to see Jehovah during his lifetime (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzgxXQ==\">v 11<\/a>). Inspired by his mentor Isaiah, who had seen Jehovah in the temple (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzcxXQ==\">Isaiah 6:1<\/a>), Hezekiah wanted the same privilege. His inquiry, &ldquo;What of a sign that I shall [again] go up to the house of Jehovah?&rdquo; thus implies more than his physically being able to worship again at the temple. Hezekiah knows from Isaiah that the ultimate purpose of temple ordinances is to see Jehovah (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzY2NiI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 1:11-12<\/a>). It was therefore a great source of anguish that he was going to leave this world without fulfilling that desire.<\/p><p>An ancient apocryphal work, the <em>Ascension of Isaiah<\/em>, records how Hezekiah sees Jehovah during his illness (<em>Ascension of Isaiah<\/em>, 1:4). The &ldquo;sign&rdquo; Jehovah gives Hezekiah is the sun&rsquo;s reversing its descent by ten degrees. That has meaning in its ancient Near Eastern context of the king&rsquo;s role as the &ldquo;sun of his people.&rdquo; As in Egypt, the sun&rsquo;s disc rising over the primeval hill signifies Pharaoh&rsquo;s ascent to God and a new age dawning for his people. The extension of Hezekiah&rsquo;s life thus betokens Jehovah&rsquo;s renewed blessing when king and people pass their tests of loyalty and spiritually ascend.<\/p>",
