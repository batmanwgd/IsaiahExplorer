The heathen worshipped their idols in groves: whereas God, in opposition to this species of idolatry, commanded his people, when they should come into the promised land, to destroy all the places wherein the Canaanites had served their gods, and in particular to burn their groves with fire, <a class=\"ref\">Deuteronomy 12:2-3<\/a>. These apostate Jews sacrificed upon altars built of bricks; in opposition to the command of God, with regard to his altar, which was to be of unhewn stone, <a class=\"ref\">Exodus 20:25<\/a>. Or it means perhaps that they sacrificed upon the roofs of their houses, which were always flat, and paved with brick or tile, or plaster of terrace; an instance of this idolatrous practice we find <a class=\"ref\">2 Kings 23:12<\/a> , where it is said that Josiah<i>beat down the altars that were on the top of the upper chamber of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made. <\/i> See also <a class=\"ref\">Zephaniah 1:5<\/a>.\u201d<i>Who remain among the graves, and lodge in the monuments<\/i>\u2014Or, as Bishop Lowth renders it, <i>Who dwell in the sepulchres and lodge in the caverns,<\/i> for the purposes of<i>necromancy,<\/i> (or, the art of revealing future events by communications with the dead,) and<i>divination;<\/i> to obtain dreams and revelations: another instance this of heathenish superstition, which the Latin poet describes as follows: \u2014<em>\u2014<\/em><\/p> \n\n<p><em>\u201cHere in distress th\u2019 Italian nations come, Anxious to clear their doubts, and learn their doom: First, on the fleeces of the slaughter\u2019d sheep, By night the sacred priest dissolves in sleep; When, in a train, before his slumb\u2019ring eye, Thin airy forms and wondrous visions fly, He calls the powers who guard the infernal floods, And talks inspired, familiar with the gods.\u201d PITT. <\/em><\/p> \n<p><i>Which eat swine\u2019s flesh<\/i>\u2014\u201cWhich was expressly forbidden by the law, <a class=\"ref\">Leviticus 11:7<\/a>; but among the heathen was in principal request in their sacrifices and feasts. Antiochus Epiphanes compelled the Jews to eat swine\u2019s flesh, as a full proof of their renouncing their religion, <a class=\"ref\">2 Maccabees 6:18<\/a>; and <a class=\"ref\">2 Maccabees 7:1<\/a>. <i>And broth of abominable things<\/i>\u2014For lustrations, magical arts, and other superstitious and abominable practices.\u201d\u2014Bishop Lowth.<\/p> ",
