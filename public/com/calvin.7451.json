To persuade him the more, Rabshakeh again reproaches him with his poverty. \u201cIf I shall give thee two thousand horses, thou wilt not find among all thy people men to ride on them. What then is thy strength; or with what confidence dost thou dare to oppose my king?\u201d He does not offer him horses for the sake of respect or of kindness, but in order to terrify and shake still more the heart of Hezekiah. The future tense ought therefore to be explained by the subjunctive mood, \u201c <i>Although I give <\/i> thee two thousand horses, yet thou wilt not find an equal number of riders.\u201d I am aware of what is alleged by other commentators; but whoever examines the matter fully will quickly perceive that this is ironical language. <\/p> \n\n\u201cHe taunts Hezekiah on account of the want of cavalry. These words do not refer to the small number of men, but to the very small number of Jews who were skilled in horsemanship; for after Jotham the kings of Judea did not maintain any cavalry, and hence we have already seen (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 30:0<\/a>.) that a part of the Jews sought cavalry from the Egyptians.\u201d \u2014 <i>Rosenmuller. <\/i> ",
