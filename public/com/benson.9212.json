This he speaks of those who should live when the Messiah should be upon earth, fore- seeing, by the Holy Spirit, that they would forsake God and reject their Messiah, and thereby bring utter destruction upon themselves. For even the Hebrew doctors expound this place of the perfidiousness of some Jews in the times of the Messiah. And it is not strange that so sad a sight made the prophet cry out, <i>My leanness, &c., the treacherous dealers,<\/i>,&c. This he repeats, to show the horridness of the crime, and how deeply he was affected with it. <\/p>",
