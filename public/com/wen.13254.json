    "html": "For\u2014God, resolving to appear as a man of war, puts on his arms; he calls righteousness his breast\u2014plate, to shew the justness of his cause, as also his faithfulness in making good his promises. Vengeance\u2014Or garments made of vengeance: as God is said to put on the former for their sakes, whom he would preserve, so he puts on these for their sakes, whom he will destroy, namely, his peoples enemies. Zeal\u2014For his own honour, and for his own people. The sum of all these expressions is, to describe both the cause and effect together; the cause was righteousness and zeal in God, the effect, salvation to his people, and vengeance on his enemies.",
