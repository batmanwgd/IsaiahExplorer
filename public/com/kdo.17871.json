First Echo - <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODEyMCI6OH0=\">Isaiah 25:1-8<\/a><\/p><p> Salvation of the Nations after the Fall of the Imperial City<\/p><p> There is not merely reflected glory, but reflected sound as well. The melodious echoes commence with <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTIwXQ==\">Isaiah 25:1<\/a>. The prophet, transported to the end of the days, commemorates what he has seen in psalms and songs. These psalms and songs not only repeat what has already been predicted; but, sinking into it, and drawing out of it, they partly expand it themselves, and partly prepare the way for its further extension.<\/p>",
