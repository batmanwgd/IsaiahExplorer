    "html": "<p><em>The cities of Aroer are forsaken \"The cities are deserted for ever\"\u2014<\/em>What has Aroer on the river Arnon to do with Damascus? and if there be another Aroer on the northern border of the tribe of Gad, as Reland seems to think there might be, this is not much more to the purpose. Besides, the cities of Aroer, if Aroer itself is a city, makes no good sense. The Septuagint, for <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05e2\u05e8\u05e2\u05e8 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">aroer<\/span>, read <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05e2\u05d3 \u05e2\u05d3\u05d9 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">adey ad<\/span>, <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03b1\u03b9\u03c9\u03bd\u03b1<\/span>, for ever, or for a long duration. The Chaldee takes the word for a verb from <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05e2\u05e8\u05d4 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">arah<\/span>, translating it <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d7\u05e8\u05d1\u05d5 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">cherebu<\/span>, <i>devastabuntur<\/i>, \"they shall be wasted.\" The Syriac read <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05e2\u05d3\u05d5\u05e2\u05d9\u05e8 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">adoeir<\/span> . So that the reading is very doubtful. I follow the Septuagint as making the plainest sense.<\/p>",
