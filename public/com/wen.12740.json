But\u2014In the midst of these joyful tidings, I discern something which gives me cause of lamentation. My leanness\u2014I faint and pine away for grief, for the following reason. Treacherously\u2014The Jews, who have been frequently guilty of great perfidiousness towards God, are now acting the same part. Even the Hebrew doctors expound this place of the perfidiousness of some Jews in the times of the Messiah. And it is not strange that so sad a sight made the prophet cry out, My leanness, &c. He repeats it to shew the horridness of the crime.",
