    "html": "<p><i>Therefore shall your iniquity be like a breach falling. <\/i> This is a threatening of punishment, and Isaiah expresses it by a very appropriate metaphor. He compares wicked men to a wall that is rent, or that bulges out. As the \u201cswelling out\u201d of a wall threatens the ruin of it, because it cannot stand unless all the parts of it adhere closely to each other, so the haughtiness and insolence of wicked men are a sign and very sure proof of their approaching ruin; because the more they are puffed up and swelled without any solid value, the more readily do they throw themselves down headlong, and it is impossible for them not to fall speedily by their own weight. \u201cRise up,\u201d says he, \u201cand act insolently against God; he will quickly put down your presumption and insolence, for it is but an empty swelling.\u201d Hence we learn that nothing is better for us than to submit wholly to God, and to keep charge of all our senses, so as to remain chained and bound by his authority; for they who raise themselves by shaking off all humility, destroy themselves by collecting much wind. For a time, indeed, the Lord permits wicked men to swell and utter their big words, that at length, by their \u201cswelling\u201d and idle boasting, they may bring upon themselves ruin and destruction.<\/p> ",
