    "html": "<p><a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODQzMyI6MTV9\">Verses 12-26<\/a> comprise the most expansive cosmological prophecy in the Bible. As in the Genesis account, God&rsquo;s creation of the heavens and the earth begins with the organization of chaotic matter&mdash;&ldquo;waters&rdquo; and &ldquo;dust&rdquo; (<a class=\"ref\">Genesis 1:2<\/a>). A cyclical pattern of more than forty alternating motifs of chaos and creation commence in chapter 40 and stretch to the end of chapter 46, affirming that God&rsquo;s creation occurs from preexisting matter, not<em>ex nihilo&shy;<\/em> or out of nothing. Isaiah&rsquo;s account of God&rsquo;s creation proceeds sequentially from the formation of the &ldquo;heavens&rdquo; and the &ldquo;earth&rdquo; to &ldquo;mountains&rdquo; and &ldquo;hills.&rdquo;<\/p> ",
