And it shall be said among the wicked: Let us not go up to battle against Zion, for the inhabitants of Zion are terrible; wherefore we cannot stand\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 45:66-70; 115:6<\/a>). Jesus, of course, is our ultimate refuge and shelter from life's battles (25:4).<\/p> <p><i>storm\/rain.<\/i> These are symbols for God's judgments on the wicked (<a class=\"ref\">Ps. 83:15<\/a>). The <i>storms<\/i> remove the wicked from their places as chaff is removed from the wheat (<a class=\"ref\">Job 21:18; 27:21<\/a>), while the righteous, like wheat, are gathered into protected units and preserved (in the Lord's temples and other holy places).<\/p> ",
