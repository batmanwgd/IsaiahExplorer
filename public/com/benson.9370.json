Lowth thinks this prophecy relates chiefly to the propagation of the gospel in the world by his apostles and other messengers; observing that Christ himself was <i>not sent but to the lost sheep of the house of Israel, <\/i>and consequently could be a <i>light to the Gentiles <\/i>only as he commissioned others to preach the gospel to them: see <a class=\"ref\">Ephesians 2:17<\/a>. And, taking the words in this comprehensive sense, they import, that our Saviour and his apostles would not be discouraged at the difficulties they were to meet with in the discharge of their office, but would still continue unwearied in their work, till, at last, they should surmount all opposition, plant judgment and truth in the earth, and make the remotest parts of the world own their dependance upon him as their Lord, and submit to his government. <i>And the isles <\/i>\u2014 Of the Gentiles, the countries remote from Judea, as the word often signifies; <i>shall wait for his law <\/i>\u2014 Shall gladly receive his doctrine and commands from time to time.<\/p>",
