You can only imagine how important a constant water supply would be in a desert region. Isaiah uses these \"waters that go softly\" to represent the \"living water\" of the gospel offered freely by Jehovah or Jesus Christ. Since the people of Judah refused these waters, they will get a deluge\u2014instead of living waters, Judah will get waters that bring death in the form of the Assyrian armies.  <\/p>  <p>  <b>2 Nephi 18:8. \"Reach even to the neck\"<\/b> In 701 b.c., the Assyrians invaded the kingdom of Judah and conquered many cites but did not enter Jerusalem (the head, or capital city).  <\/p>  <p>  <b>2 Nephi 18:8. \"O Immanuel\"<\/b> Here Isaiah refers to the land of Judah as Immanuel\u2014again giving an assurance that \"God is with them.\" It could also be a reminder that the Messiah will be born within the kingdom of Judah.  <\/p>  ",
