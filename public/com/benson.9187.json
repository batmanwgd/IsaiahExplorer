He foretels that God would call them to weeping and mourning, and other instances and evidences of humiliation and godly sorrow; but that, instead thereof, he should find them given up to joy and gladness, slaying oxen, &c., that is, to levity and luxury, mirth and feasting: saying, <i>Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die<\/i>\u2014The prophet tells us, that we shall certainly and suddenly be destroyed; it concerns us, therefore, to make our best of the present time, and to be merry while we have opportunity: a most perverse and desperate conclusion, proceeding from obstinate profaneness and contempt of God\u2019s judgments. <i>It was revealed in mine ears<\/i>\u2014God himself hath said to me;<i>Surely this iniquity shall not be purged till you die<\/i>\u2014This, your hardening your hearts, under and against God\u2019s judgments, and defeating and rendering ineffectual the means provided for bringing you to repentance, shall never be forgiven you, but you shall feel the effects of such conduct, and of God\u2019s displeasure against you for it, as long as you live.<\/p> ",
