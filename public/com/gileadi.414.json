    "html": "<p>Rabshakeh reveals Assyria&rsquo;s policy of removing captive peoples from their native soil and replacing them with others whom they conquer so as to destroy their patriotism and ties to the land. When the Assyrians took Israel&rsquo;s ten northern tribes captive, for example, they relocated them &ldquo;in Halah and in Habor, the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes&rdquo; (<a class=\"ref\">2 Kings 17:6<\/a>). They then brought peoples from other regions&mdash;&ldquo;from Babylon and Cuthah, from Ava, Hamath, and Sepharvaim&rdquo;&mdash;to occupy Samaria (<a class=\"ref\">2 Kings 17:24<\/a>). These new peoples later became known as the &ldquo;Samaritans&rdquo; (cf.<a class=\"ref\">John 4:3-42<\/a>).<\/p> ",
