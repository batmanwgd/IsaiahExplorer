    "html": " <i>red in thine apparel.<\/i> When Christ returns, his garments will be red, as John saw: \"And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood\" (<a class=\"ref\">Rev. 19:13; D&amp;C 133:48<\/a>). The red clothing symbolizes at least three things: the blood Christ shed in performing the Atonement (<a class=\"ref\">Luke 22:44; D&amp;C 19:18<\/a>) the blood (or sins) of the wicked that he took upon himself (blood and sins are equated in <a class=\"ref\">Jacob 1:19<\/a>; see also <a class=\"ref\">1 Pet. 3:18; Alma 33:22<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\">3 Ne. 11:11<\/a>) and the blood of the unrepentant wicked he has slain in his wrath (63:3; <a class=\"ref\">Lam. 1:15; D&amp;C 133:48<\/a>, <a class=\"ref\"> 50-51<\/a>). The blood symbolism is repeated here in the use of the words <i>Edom, dyed garments, garments like him&hellip;in the winevat, winepress, blood&hellip;upon my garments, <\/i>and <i>stain all my raiment.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>treadeth&hellip;winevat.<\/i> The Jerusalem Bible reads, \"Yahweh is represented as one who treads the grapes, his garments stained red. But what he has been treading are the nations, whose blood has spattered him, and who are represented by Edom. Some emend 'Edom' and 'Bozrah' and translate 'Who is this that comes all in red, in crimson garments like a wine-harvester?'\"<\/p> ",
