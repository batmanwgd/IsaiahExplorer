The Lord revealed to Joseph Smith, \"But before the arm of the Lord shall fall, an angel shall sound his trump, and the saints that have slept shall come forth to meet me in the cloud&hellip;. Then shall the arm of the Lord fall upon the nations&hellip;and the nations of the earth shall mourn&hellip;. And calamity shall cover the mocker, and the scorner shall be consumed; and they that have watched for iniquity shall be hewn down and cast into the fire\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 45:45-50<\/a>). <\/p> ",
