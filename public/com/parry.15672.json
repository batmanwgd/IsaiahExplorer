I will also make you a light for the Gentiles, that you may bring my salvation to the ends of the earth.\" In other words, the Lord has a much greater work for the servant than to simply bless Israel\u2014the servant is destined to bless the whole earth.<\/p> <p><i>raise up.<\/i> In this context <i>raise up <\/i>refers to bringing forth or lifting up through the covenant.<\/p> <p><i>tribes of Jacob.<\/i> The twelve tribes of Israel are also called the <i>tribes of Jacob.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>preserved of Israel.<\/i> This term may refer to those who have remained true to God, who have been preserved in faith, or it may mean those in the last days who are delivered from spiritual bondage and restored to the blessings of the gospel covenant.<\/p> <p><i>light to the Gentiles.<\/i> God's servant not only will gather and restore the descendants of Abraham but will also reach out to the Gentiles. Thus salvation will reach \"unto the end of the earth.\" The <i>light to the Gentiles<\/i> is variously defined in the scriptures as Jesus Christ (42:6-7; <a class=\"ref\">Luke 2:32<\/a>), the priesthood (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 86:11<\/a>), and Zion (60:3). If the servant referred to in this section is not the Messiah himself, he certainly will shine with the light of the Messiah.<\/p> <p><i>end of the earth.<\/i> \"Every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people\" (<a class=\"ref\">Rev. 14:6; 1 Ne. 19:16<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 133:37<\/a>). <\/p> ",
