    "html": "<p>Second turn, <i>\u201cBy thy servants<\/i> (K. <i>thy messengers<\/i>)<i>hast thou reviled the Lord, in that thou sayest, With the multitude<\/i> (K. <i>chethib<\/i><span class=\"normal hebrew\"> \u05d1\u05e8\u05db\u05d1<\/span>)<i>of my chariots have I climbed the height of the mountains, the inner side of Lebanon; and I shall fell the lofty growth of its cedars, the choice<\/i> (<i>(<span class=\"translit\"> mibhchar<\/span>),<\/i> K. <i>(<span class=\"translit\"> mibhcho\u0304r<\/span>))<i>of its cypresses: and I shall penetrate<\/i> (K. <i>and will penetrate<\/i>)<i>to the height<\/i> (K. <i>the halting-place<\/i>)<i>of its uttermost border, the grove of its orchard.\u201d<\/i> The other text appears, for the most part, the preferable one here. Whether<i>(<span class=\"translit\"> mal'a\u0306khekha\u0302<\/span>) (thy messengers, according to <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODQ0XQ==\">Isaiah 9:14<\/a>) or<i>(<span class=\"translit\"> \u201ba\u0306bha\u0302dekha\u0302<\/span>) (thy servants, viz., Rabshakeh, Tartan, and Rabsaris) is to be preferred, may be left undecided; also whether<span class=\"normal hebrew\"> \u05e8\u05db\u05d1\u05d9<\/span><span class=\"normal hebrew\"> \u05d1\u05e8\u05db\u05d1<\/span> is an error or a superlative expression, \u201cwith chariots of my chariots,\u201d i.e., my countless chariots; also, thirdly, whether Isaiah wrote<i>(<span class=\"translit\"> mibhcho\u0304r<\/span>). He uses<i>(<span class=\"translit\"> misto\u0304r<\/span>) in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzQwXQ==\">Isaiah 4:6<\/a> for a special reason; but such obscure forms befit in other instances the book of Kings, with its colouring of northern Palestine; and we also meet with (<span class=\"translit\"> mibhcho\u0304r<\/span>) in <a class=\"ref\">2 Kings 3:19<\/a> , in the strongly Aramaic first series of histories of Elisha. On the other hand,<span class=\"normal hebrew\"> \u05e7\ufb46\u05d4<\/span><span class=\"normal hebrew\"> \u05de\u05dc\u05d5\u05df<\/span> is certainly the original reading, in contrast with<span class=\"normal hebrew\"> \u05e7\u05e6\u05d5<\/span><span class=\"normal hebrew\"> \u05de\u05e8\u05d5\u05dd<\/span> . It is important, as bearing upon the interpretation of the passage, that both texts have<span class=\"normal hebrew\"> \u05d5\u05d0\u05db\u05e8\u05ea<\/span> , not<span class=\"normal hebrew\"> \u05d5\u05d0\u05db\u05e8\u05ea<\/span> , and that the other text confirms this pointing, inasmuch as it has<span class=\"normal hebrew\"> \u05d5\u05d0\u05d1\u05d5\u05d0\u05d4<\/span> instead of<span class=\"normal hebrew\"> \u05d5\u05d0\u05d5\u05d1\u05d0<\/span> . The Lebanon here, if not purely emblematical (as in <a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 22:6<\/a> = the royal city Jerusalem; <a class=\"ref\">Ezekiel 17:3<\/a> = Judah-Jerusalem), has at any rate a synecdochical meaning (cf., <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3OTM3XQ==\">Isaiah 14:8<\/a>), signifying the land of Lebanon, i.e., the land of Israel, into which he had forced a way, and all the fortresses and great men of which he would destroy. He would not rest till Jerusalem, the most renowned height of the land of Lebanon, was lying at his feet. Thenius is quite right in regarding the \u201cresting-place of the utmost border\u201d and \u201cthe pleasure-garden wood\u201d as containing allusions to the holy city and its royal citadel (compare the allegory in chapter 5). <br><\/i><\/i><\/i><\/i><\/i><\/p> ",
