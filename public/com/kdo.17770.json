They did not spare the fruit of the womb, since they ripped up the bodies of those that were with child (<a class=\"ref\">2 Kings 8:12; 2 Kings 15:16<\/a>, etc.). Even towards children they felt no emotion of compassionate regard, such as would express itself in the eye: chuus, to feel, more especially to feel with another, i.e., to sympathize; here and in <a class=\"ref\">Ezekiel 5:11<\/a> it is ascribed to the eye as the mirror of the soul (compare the Arabic <em> chasyet el<\/em> -<em> \u201bain ala fula\u0302nin <\/em> , carefulness of eye for a person: Hariri, <em> Comment<\/em> . p. 140). With such inhuman conduct on the part of the foe, the capital of the empire becomes the scene of a terrible conflagration.<\/p>",
