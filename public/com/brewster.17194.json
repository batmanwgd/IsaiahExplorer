He first reprimanded his questioners for their lack of spiritual understanding, reviewed basic commandments, cited messianic prophecies, and bore personal witness of the coming of the Son of God. (<a class=\"ref\">Mosiah 12:25-15<\/a>:9.) He then identified the prophets as having published the good tidings of the gospel. He spoke of them in the past, present, and future tense. (<a class=\"ref\">Mosiah 15:10-17<\/a>.) The Lord Himself is identified as \"the founder of peace\" (<a class=\"ref\">Mosiah 15:18<\/a>), whose message (gospel) of peace is preached and published by the prophets. In an extended sense, all missionaries and teachers of the gospel are included among those whose beautiful feet tread the earth, or stand in front of a classroom, in proclaiming the Lord's gospel. (See <a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 19:29; 31:3<\/a>.)<\/p>",
