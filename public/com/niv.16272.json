The Servant is now compared to a sheep, and with very different results. In him it is the mild, defenseless nature of the sheep that is the basis of comparison. Although his suffering is manifestly unjust, he accepts it without protest (53:7). It is significant that the only extended metaphor in the poem deals with sheep, the animals of sacrifice. The injustice of what the Servant suffered is further underlined in 53:8\u2013 9. He is deprived of justice, but he is also deprived of \u201cdescendants,\u201d evidently \u201ccut off\u201d in the prime of life. As a final insult, he is buried with the rich. But is this an insult? Surely the Old Testament frequently treats riches as a blessing from God. But it also has a more ambiguous view of riches, especially in the Prophets. Isaiah\u2019s statement in 5:8, \u201cWoe to you who add house to house and field to field till no space is left and you live alone in the land,\u201d more accurately reflects the view of such prophets as Hosea and Amos (and Jesus). In their view, riches have all too often been amassed through violence and deceit. The contrastive \u201cthough\u201d seems to make clear that that is the sense here. The Servant is buried with the rich even \u201cthough\u201d he did not do what they did. As he had not opened his mouth in self-defense (53:7), neither had he opened it in \u201cdeceit\u201d (53:9).<\/p>     ",
