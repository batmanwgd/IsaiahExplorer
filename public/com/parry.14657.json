In a symbolic sense, these can also refer to an apostate people in the latter days who will be subjected to such judgments as are detailed here.<\/p> <p><i>bread\/water.<\/i> These are perhaps representative of all forms of physical nourishment, but they also have spiritual connotations in reference to the Lord, who is metaphorically the bread of life (<a class=\"ref\">John 6:33,  48<\/a>) and the living water (<a class=\"ref\">John 4:6-14; 7:37<\/a> 38). Certainly God removes his presence from us when we become wicked, just as bread and water will be removed from Judah and Jerusalem for their iniquity (3:8-9). Thus, this prophecy foresees both physical and spiritual famine.<\/p> ",
