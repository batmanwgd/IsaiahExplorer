This person is designated, very appropriately, as a fool. <\/p> <p> <em>Shall be no more called liberal <\/em>&mdash;It is probable that under the reign of former princes, when all views of right and wrong had been perverted, people of unprincipled character had been the subjects of flattery, and names of virtue had been attributed to them by their friends and admirers. But it would not be so under the virtuous reign of the prince here celebrated. Things would be called by their right names, and flattery would not be allowed to attribute to people, qualities which they did not possess. <\/p> <p> <em>Nor the churl <\/em>&mdash;The word &lsquo;churl&rsquo; means properly a rude, surly, ill-bred man; then a miser, a niggard. The Hebrew word means properly a deceiver, a fraudulent man (Gesenius). The word avaricious, however, seems to suit the connection. Lowth renders it, &lsquo;Niggard.&rsquo; Noyes, &lsquo;Crafty.&rsquo; <\/p> <p> <em>Bountiful <\/em>&mdash;Flattery shall no more ascribe to a miserly man a character which does not belong to him. <\/p> ",
