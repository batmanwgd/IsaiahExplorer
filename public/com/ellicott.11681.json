    "html": "<p>             (11) He shall see of the travail . . .\u2014Better, On account of the travail of his soul, he shall see, and be refreshed. We may find the truest explanation in the words, \u201cTo-day thou shalt be with me in paradise\u201d (<a class=\"ref\">Luke 23:43<\/a>). The refreshment after travail, because of the travail, was already present to the sufferer\u2019s consciousness.<\/p>\n <p>By his knowledge . . .\u2014The phrase admits of two meanings, objective and subjective: (1) by their knowledge of Him; or (2) by His own knowledge; and each expresses a truth. Men are saved by knowing Christ. To know Him and the Father is eternal life (<a class=\"ref\">John 17:3<\/a>). On the other hand, the Christ Himself makes His knowledge of the Father the ground of His power to impart that knowledge to men, and so to justify and save them (<a class=\"ref\">John 17:25<\/a>). Without that knowledge He could not have led them to know God as He knew. If we dare not say that the prophet distinctly contemplated both meanings, we may rejoice that he was guided to use a phrase which includes both. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTc4ODc=\">Isaiah 11:2<\/a> and <a class=\"ref\">Malachi 2:7<\/a> are in favour of (2).<\/p>\n <p>For he shall bear.\u2014The conjunction is not necessarily more than and. The importance of the renewal of the assurance given in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTg3MTY=\">Isaiah 53:4<\/a> lies in its declaring the perpetuity of the atoning work. The sacrifice of the Servant is \u201cfor ever\u201d (<a class=\"ref\">Hebrews 10:12<\/a>). He \u201cever liveth to make intercession for us\u201d (<a class=\"ref\">Hebrews 7:25<\/a>). He taketh away the sin of the world, through the \u00e6ons of all duration (<a class=\"ref\">John 1:29<\/a>).<\/p>",
