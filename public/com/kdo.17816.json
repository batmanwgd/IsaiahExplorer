    "html": "<p> The oracle opens with a short introduction, condensing the whole of the substance of the first half into a few weighty words - an art in which Isaiah peculiarly excelled. In this the name of Egypt, the land without an equal, occurs no less than three times. <em> \u201cBehold, Jehovah rideth upon a light cloud, and cometh to Egypt; and the idols of Egypt shake before Him, and the heart of Egypt melteth within it.\u201d<\/em> Jehovah rides upon clouds when He is about to reveal Himself in His judicial majesty (<a class=\"ref\">Psalms 18:11<\/a>); and in this instance He rides upon a light cloud, because it will take place rapidly. The word <em> kal<\/em> signifies both light and swift, because what is light moves swiftly; and even a light cloud, which is light because it is thin, is comparatively \u05e2\u05d1 , i.e., literally dense, opaque, or obscure. The idols of Egypt shake \u05e0\u05d5\u05bc\u05e2 , as in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3Nzc0LDE3Nzg1XQ==\">Isaiah 6:4; Isaiah 7:2<\/a>), because Jehovah comes over them to judgment (cf., <a class=\"ref\">Exodus 12:12; Jeremiah 46:25; Ezekiel 30:13<\/a>): they must shake, for they are to be thrown down; and their shaking for fear is a shaking to their fall \u05e0\u05d5\u05bc\u05e2 , as in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTE2LDE4MjAzXQ==\">Isaiah 24:20; Isaiah 29:9<\/a>). The <em> Vav<\/em> <em> apodosis<\/em> in \u05d5\u05e0\u05e2\u05d5\u05bc together the cause and effect, as in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3Nzc3XQ==\">Isaiah 6:7<\/a>. - In what judgments the judgment will be fulfilled, is now declared by the majestic Judge Himself. <\/p>",
