    "html": "          <p>President Charles W. Nibley once quoted this verse and said it referred to Utah and the missionary program, which was gathering Saints to Zion (see CR, Apr. 1930, p. 29). This idea is consistent with the Prophet Joseph Smith's designation of North and South America as the Zion spoken of by the Old Testament prophets (see TPJS, p. 362). But Utah would be only a part of this Zion, and these same physical and social blessings are to come to all the gathering places of the Saints in the land of Zion. The blessings pronounced upon Zion's waste places, wilderness, and deserts are reminiscent of the physical blessings which the Lord has promised those who keep the Sabbath in the land of Zion. These things will be given \"to please the eye and to gladden the heart,\" and will all come \"according to the law and the prophets\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 59:16-19, 22<\/a>). <\/p>     ",
