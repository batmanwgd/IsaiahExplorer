    "html": " <p>This short passage is a sweet invitation to come to the living waters of Christ and drink freely (55:1). The gospel and the blessings of the Atonement have no temporal cost (55:1-2). Why would we spend our time, effort, and money for that which has no lasting value? (55:2). Rather than spending money and labor on things that \"cannot satisfy\" (55:2), we can come unto the Lord and \"feast\" on things of eternal value, which never will perish (55:2). Such things are a delight to the soul (55:2). Come unto Christ, then, hearken to him, and live (55:2-3).<\/p> <blockquote> Ho, every one that thirsteth,     <br><i>come ye to the waters,<\/i> and he that hath <u>no money<\/u><i>;<\/i> <i>come ye, <\/i>buy, and eat;     <br>yea, <i>come, <\/i>buy wine and milk <u>without money and without price<\/u>. (55:1)     <br>Wherefore do [not]<i> spend money<\/i> for <u>that which is [of no worth<\/u>,]     <br>nor your <i>labour<\/i> for <u>that which [cannot satisfy<\/u>].     <br><i>Hearken<\/i> diligently <u>unto me<\/u>,     <br>and [<i>remember<\/i> the <u>words which I have spoken<\/u>;     <br>and <i>come<\/i> <u>unto the<\/u> <u>Holy One of Israel<\/u>,     <br>and <i>feast<\/i> <u>upon that which perisheth not<\/u>, neither can be corrupted,]     <br>and <i>let your soul delight<\/i> itself <u>in fatness<\/u>. (55:2)     <br><i>Incline your ear,<\/i> and <u>come unto me<\/u>:     <br><i>hear,<\/i> and <u>your soul shall live<\/u>;     <br>and I will make an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure mercies of David.
