    "html": "<p>Those who don&rsquo;t meet Jehovah&rsquo;s conditions for deliverance&mdash;by keeping the law of his covenant, replacing their self-righteousness with<em>his<\/em> standard of righteousness&mdash;fall prey to the archtyrant and those who emulate him. Commissioned by Jehovah to &ldquo;pillage for plunder and spoliate for spoil&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODU3XQ==\">Isaiah 10:6<\/a>), he humbles Jehovah&rsquo;s people until a remnant turns back to its God (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzg3MSI6M30=\">Isaiah 10:20-22<\/a>). Because his people didn&rsquo;t &ldquo;rescue&rdquo; those who needed rescuing, nor &ldquo;demanded restitution&rdquo; for those who were wronged (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxNzY3MiwxNzY3OF0seyIxODc5MyI6NX1d\">Isaiah 1:17, 23; 58:6-10<\/a>), they experience this same plight as a covenant curse.<\/p> ",
