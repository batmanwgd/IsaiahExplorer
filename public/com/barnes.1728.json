    "html": "<p><em>Go ye forth of Babylon<\/em>&mdash;The prophet now directly addresses those who were in exile in Babylon, and commands them to depart from it. The design of this is, to furnish the assurance that they should be delivered, and to show them the duty of leaving the place of their long captivity when the opportunity of doing it should occur. It is also designed to show that when it should occur, it would be attended with great joy and rejoicing.<\/p><p><em>Flee ye from the Chaldeans with a voice of singing<\/em>&mdash;With the utmost exultation and joy. They should rejoice that their captivity was ended; they should exult at the prospect of being restored again to their own land.<\/p><p><em>Utter it even to the end of the earth<\/em>&mdash;It is an event so great and wonderful that all the nations should be made acquainted with it.<\/p><p><em>The Lord hath redeemed...<\/em>&mdash;Yahweh has rescued from captivity his people (see the notes at <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 43:1<\/a>).<\/p>",
