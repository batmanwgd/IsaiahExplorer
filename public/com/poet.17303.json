    "html": "<p><sup>22<\/sup> The LORD will first afflict and then heal the Egyptians; when they turn back to the LORD, He will respond to their entreaties and heal them. (NJV)<\/p> <p>In this verse, Isaiah explains the Lord's plans for Egypt, plans that the sages were unable to discover or reveal (vs. 12-13). This verse needs to be viewed in a religious context through the terminology Isaiah uses. He implies that the Egyptians are \"wicked\" and that the Lord will afflict them and bring them to humility. (Compare <a class=\"ref\">Alma 32:13<\/a>.) Also, Isaiah says that they will \"turn back\" (or repent), meaning that they must have sinned earlier. After they repent, the Lord will respond to their entreaties (prayers) and heal (forgive) them. This promise is among the greatest that any people can receive from the Lord.<\/p>",
