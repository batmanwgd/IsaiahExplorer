Concerning such wishes as these, when ascribed to God, see note on <a class=\"ref\">Deuteronomy 5:29; Deuteronomy 32:29 <\/a>,, and especially on <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 81:13 <\/a>. <i>Then had thy peace been as a river <\/i>\u2014Which runs pleasantly, strongly, plentifully, and constantly. Thou shouldst have enjoyed a series of mercies, one continually following another, as the waters of a river, which always last, and not like the waters of a land-flood, which are soon gone; <i>and thy righteousness <\/i>\u2014The fruit of thy righteousness, thy peace and prosperity; <i>as the waves of the sea \u2014 <\/i>,Numberless and abundant. Or the meaning may be, Thou wouldest have been as remarkable for virtue and holiness as for peace and happiness. <i>Thy seed also had been as the sand <\/i>\u2014Namely, for multitude, according to my promise made to Abraham; whereas now, for thy sins, I have greatly diminished thy numbers by invasions, captivities, and other judgments. <i>His name <\/i>\u2014The name of thy seed, or offspring, mentioned in the former clauses; <i>should not have been cut off <\/i>\u2014As now it hath been in a great measure, namely, from the land of Israel, which is either desolate, or inhabited by strangers; <i>nor destroyed from before me <\/i>\u2014Or, <i>out of my sight, <\/i>,from the place of my special presence and residence. <\/p>,",
