Here he names the \u201cone from the east\u201d (41:2) who will be Israel\u2019s savior. Furthermore, he specifies why Jerusalem will have good tidings to share with the surrounding towns (cf. 40:9). The man\u2019s name is \u201cCyrus,\u201d the Persian king who will conquer Babylon and who will see to it that Jerusalem\u2019s temple is rebuilt (44:28).<\/p>     <p>\u2003But the naming of Cyrus is only the final act in a long list. As the punctuation in the <small>NIV<\/small> shows, 44:24\u201328 comprises a single sentence consisting of a succession of participles that define \u201c<small>I<\/small> am the L<small>ORD<\/small>\u201d in 44:24. Here God identifies himself and demonstrates his lordship by what he does. He is the Creator, who \u201cmade\u201d everything, stretching out \u201cthe heavens\u201d and spreading out \u201cthe earth.\u201d He is the Lord of history (44:25\u201326a), revealing what he is doing to \u201chis servants\u201d the prophets and making \u201cfools\u201d of those who try to predict the future by means of magical continuities. He is the Redeemer (44:26b\u201328), who is able to rebuild the ruined \u201cJerusalem\u201d and its surrounding towns. Because he is the Creator and the Lord of history and the Redeemer, he is even able to use a pagan emperor to accomplish his purposes.<\/p>     ",
