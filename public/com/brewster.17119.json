The carnage among the wicked may be such that they resort to cannibalism both to satisfy their physical hunger and to demonstrate their depravity. Once again we look to the past for a prototype of this abominable behavior: \"They did murder them in a most cruel manner \u2026 and after they have done this, they devour their flesh like unto wild beasts, because of the hardness of their hearts; and they do it for a token of bravery.\" (<a class=\"ref\">Moroni 9:10<\/a>.)<\/p>",
