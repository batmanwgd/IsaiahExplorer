While he may appear absent from human affairs&mdash;&ldquo;Is it because I have so long kept silent that you no longer fear me?&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4Nzc3XQ==\">Isaiah 57:11 <\/a>)&mdash;in the end, he plainly manifests himself: &ldquo;Jehovah will come forth like a warrior, his passions aroused like a fighter; he will give the war cry, raise the shout of victory over his enemies&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDk0XQ==\">Isaiah 42:13 <\/a>). <\/p> ",
