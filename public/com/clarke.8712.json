    "html": " <p>The Jews reproved for their obstinate attachment to idols, notwithstanding their experience of the Divine providence over them; and of the Divine prescience that revealed by the prophets the most remarkable events which concerned them, that they should not have the least pretext for ascribing any portion of their success to their idols, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODYxNiI6OH0=\">Isaiah 48:1-8<\/a>. The Almighty, after bringing them to the furnace for their perverseness, asserts his glorious sovereignty, and repeats his gracious promises of deliverance and consolation, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODYyNCI6M30=\">Isaiah 48:9-11<\/a>. Prophecy concerning that individual (Cyrus) who shall be an instrument in the hand of God of executing his will on Babylon, and his power on the Chaldeans; and the idols of the people are again challenged to give a like proof of their foreknowledge, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODYyNyI6NX0=\">Isaiah 48:12-16<\/a>. Tender and passionate exclamation of Jehovah respecting the hardened condition of the Jewish nation, to which the very pathetic exclamation of the Divine Savior when he wept over Jerusalem may be considered a striking parallel, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODYzMiI6M30=\">Isaiah 48:17-19<\/a>. Notwithstanding the repeated provocations of the house of Israel, Jehovah will again be merciful to them. They are commanded to escape from Babylon; and God's gracious favor towards them is beautifully represented by images borrowed from the exodus from Egypt, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NjM1LDE4NjM2XQ==\">Isaiah 48:20, Isaiah 48:21<\/a>. Certain perdition of the finally impenitent, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NjM3XQ==\">Isaiah 48:22<\/a>. It will be proper here to remark that many passages in this chapter, and indeed the general strain of these prophecies, have a plain aspect to a restoration of the Church in the latter days upon a scale much greater than the world has yet witnessed, when the very violent fall of Babylon the Great, mentioned in the Revelation, of which the Chaldean capital was an expressive type, shall introduce by a most tremendous political convulsion, (<a class=\"ref\">Revelation 16:17-21<\/a>;), that glorious epoch of the Gospel, which forms so conspicuous a part of the prophecies of the Old Testament, and has been a subject of the prayers of all saints in all ages. <\/p>",
