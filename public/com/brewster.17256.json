Lest there be misunderstanding regarding the divine attributes of Deity, a brief explanation of God's wrath or anger is appropriate. Anger, as understood or displayed by mortals, is not a characteristic of God's conduct.<\/p>     <p>\"A distinction should be made between the appropriate anger of God, which is a righteous application of the law of justice, and the unbridled anger of a fallible mortal. The Lord has consistently counseled his children against anger (<a class=\"ref\">Matt. 5:21-22; 3 Ne. 11:21-22<\/a>); furthermore, we have been instructed that the devil 'is the father of contention, and he stirreth up the hearts of men to contend with anger, one with another' (<a class=\"ref\">3 Ne. 11:29<\/a>). One who is angry loses the Spirit and his love of his fellowman (<a class=\"ref\">Moro. 9:3-5<\/a>).<\/p>     <p>\"In contrast, properly understood, God's anger is a divine display of his love. It is a manifestation of truth. (See <a class=\"ref\">2 Ne. 1:24-27<\/a>.)\" (DCE, 18.)<\/p>",
