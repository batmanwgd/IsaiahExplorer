It became Christian early with the rest of the neighboring countries. St. Paul himself found many Christians there,<a class=\"ref\">Acts 21:4<\/a> . It suffered much in the Diocletian persecution. It was an archbishopric under the patriarchate of Jerusalem, with fourteen bishoprics under its jurisdiction. It continued Christian till it was taken by the Saracens in 639; was recovered by the Christians in 1124; but in 1280 was conquered by the Mamelukes, and afterwards taken from them by the Turks in 1517. Since that time it has sunk into utter decay; is now a mere ruin, a bare rock, \"a place to spread nets upon,\" as the Prophet Ezekiel foretold it should be,<a class=\"ref\">Ezekiel 26:14<\/a> . See Sandy's Travels; Vitringa on the place; Bp. Newton on the Prophecies, Dissert. xi.<\/p> ",
