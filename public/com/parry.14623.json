    "html": " <p> This prophecy speaks of our day. Isaiah prophesies of two separate groups who will live in the last days (the timing of which is made clearer by Joseph Smith): those who belong to Zion, and those who belong to the community of wickedness. In the latter days, Zion will be restored, redeemed, and cleansed; her dross and tin will be removed, her righteous judges and counselors will be restored, and once again Zion will be the faithful city\u2014the \"city of righteousness.\" The text makes clear that it is the Lord's atoning sacrifice that will cleanse members of Zion: \"I will turn my hand upon thee, and purely purge away thy dross\" (1:25). Those who belong to the wicked community will be destroyed, \"consumed,\" \"ashamed,\" \"confounded,\" and burned.<\/p> <blockquote>Therefore saith the Lord,     <br>the <i>Lord of hosts,<\/i>     <br>the <i>mighty one of Israel,<\/i>     <br>Ah, I will <i>ease me<\/i> of mine <u>adversaries<\/u>,     <br>and <i>avenge me<\/i> of mine <u>enemies<\/u>: (1:24)     <br>And I will turn my hand upon thee, and purely <i>purge away <\/i>thy <u>dross<\/u>,     <br>and <i>take away<\/i> all thy <u>tin<\/u>: (1:25)     <br>And I will restore thy <i> judges <\/i> as at the <u>first<\/u>,     <br>and thy <i>counsellors<\/i> as at the <u>beginning<\/u>:     <br>afterward thou shalt be called, The <i>city<\/i> of <u>righteousness,<\/u>     <br>the <u>faithful<\/u> <i>city.<\/i> (1:26)     <br><i>Zion<\/i> shall be redeemed with [<u>justice<\/u>],     <br>and her <i>converts<\/i> with <u>righteousness<\/u>.
