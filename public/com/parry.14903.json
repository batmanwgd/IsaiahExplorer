Today, as in days of old, Lucifer is persuading us to commit sins so that he may drag us down to hell.<\/i><\/p> <p><i> <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzk1MyI6NH0=\">Isa. 14:24-27<\/a> provides us comfort in the knowledge that God controls the destiny of all the nations of the earth; he controlled humanity's affairs in the past, he directs the present, and he commands the future. Knowing of his power over the nations enables us to trust him and the prophets who speak his words.<\/i><\/p> ",
