    "html": "<p>When people no longer have confidence in their leaders&mdash;when things go awry because no one seeks guidance from God&mdash;they turn on each other out of exasperation (cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc4NTEiOjF9LHsiMTgwMDciOjF9LHsiMTg3MzkiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 9:21; 19:2; 54:15<\/a>). As Jehovah withdraws his Spirit, the spirits of demons overcome them. A mood of contention takes over and society fragments into disparate elements. Isaiah&rsquo;s paralleling &ldquo;the young&rdquo; and &ldquo;the vile&rdquo; implies that the rising generation has turned base. As the latter assume they are every bit as wise and intelligent as the older generation, the practice of showing deference or respect becomes unknown.<\/p>",
