He suffered sorrow in contemplating the fate of those who rejected him (<a class=\"ref\">Matt. 23:37-39<\/a>). In addition, in the Garden of Gethsemane, he took upon himself our <i>griefs<\/i> and <i>sorrows,<\/i> as well as our sins. Through the atonement of Christ we can find peace in the midst of grief and trouble. It is because of the Atonement that the Comforter has power to accomplish his work of bringing solace to troubled souls. The word <i>sorrows <\/i>may also be translated <i>pains; <\/i>Christ carried our infirmities and sickness. As Matthew wrote,[\"[He] healed all that were sick: That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, Himself took our infirmities, and bare our sicknesses\" (<a class=\"ref\">Matt. 8:14-17<\/a>). These infirmities and sicknesses, are, of course, both physical and spiritual.<\/p> ",
