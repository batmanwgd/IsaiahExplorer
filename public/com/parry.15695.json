Perhaps the Lord's manifestation of power will be so great that all creatures will know he is God.<\/p> <p><i>Saviour\/Redeemer\/Mighty One of Jacob.<\/i> These three titles of Jehovah signify his power to rescue and succor us from death and sin (Savior), to ransom us and purchase us from the demands of justice (Redeemer), and to deliver us from all our enemies (Mighty One).<\/p> ",
