    "html": "<p>The parallel incidence of &ldquo;invoking blessings&rdquo; and &ldquo;swearing oaths&rdquo; shows their interrelationship: covenant blessings come from swearing oaths to Jehovah&mdash;as when one makes covenants with him and keeps them (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 19:18-21; 56:1-5<\/a>). Mention of the &ldquo;true God&rdquo; or &ldquo;God of truth&rdquo; infers that, while Jehovah&rsquo;s people have corrupted their covenant oaths and ordinances (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 24:5; 48:1<\/a>), he restores them in their purity (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 26:7-9; 51:4<\/a>). In the millennial age of peace that ensues, the &ldquo;troubles&rdquo; or &ldquo;calamities&rdquo; (<em>sarot<\/em>) Jehovah&rsquo;s people brought on themselves entirely fade from memory.<\/p>",
