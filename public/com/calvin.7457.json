    "html": "<p><i> Thus saith the king.<\/i> While he claims for his master the name of<i> king,<\/i> he speaks of Hezekiah as a private individual, without adding any title.<\/p> \n<p><i> Let not Hezekiah impose upon you.<\/i> He goes on to utter impudent calumnies against him, and at the same time vomits out his venom against God himself; for he calls it \u201cimposture\u201d and \u201cdeception\u201d for Hezekiah to rely on his favor, and to exhort his subjects to cherish the same confidence. But with similar calumnies are we now assailed by the Papists, who say that we bewitch the minds of men and lead them to destruction, and who have no pretext for saying so, except that we teach them that they ought to hope in the true God. But we have no reason to wonder that the same things which were spoken against the good king are likewise brought forward against us, since they proceed from the same inventor and teacher of slander, Satan.<\/p> \n<p><i> For he will not be able to deliver you.<\/i> Rabshakeh\u2019s assertion, that they cannot be delivered by the hand of Hezekiah, is indeed true, unless God assist; and Hezekiah did not lay claim to this or rob God of the honor due to him, but, on the contrary, testified that his own safety and that of the people were in the hand of God. But the enemy found it necessary to employ some pretext, as wicked men commonly do at the present day, when they slander our doctrine; for they employ pretexts which give high plausibility to what they say, and which actually deceive men, when they are not closely examined.<\/p> ",
