That both these cities should be taken in the night is a circumstance somewhat unusual; but not so material as to deserve to be so strongly insisted upon. Vitringa, by his remark on this word, shows that he was dissatisfied with it in its plain and obvious meaning, and is forced to have recourse to a very hard metaphorical interpretation of it. <i>Noctu vel nocturno impetu; vel metaphorice, repente, subito, inexpectata destructione: placet posterius<\/i>. Calmet conjectures, and I think it probable, that the true reading is <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05db\u05dc\u05d9\u05dc <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">keleil<\/span>, as the night. There are many mistakes in the Hebrew text arising from the very great similitude of the letters <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d1 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">beth<\/span>, and <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05db <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">caph<\/span>, which in many MSS., and some printed editions, are hardly distinguishable.<\/p>\n\n<p>Admitting this reading, the translation will be, - <\/p>\n\n<p>   \"Because Ar is utterly destroyed, Moab is undone!<\/p>\n\n<p>   Because Kir is utterly destroyed, Moab is undone!\"<\/p>",
