    "html": "<p>The &ldquo;ensign&rdquo; (<em>nes<\/em>), &ldquo;voice&rdquo; (<em>qol<\/em>), and &ldquo;hand&rdquo; (<em>yad<\/em>), which appear in parallel, here denote the king of Assyria\/Babylon who rallies an alliance of nations to conquer the world. That these terms also designate Jehovah&rsquo;s servant in the Book of Isaiah implies that the two are contemporaries and rivals. The &ldquo;barren mountain&rdquo; from which the archtyrant hails identifies a nation that, apart from its military strength, isn&rsquo;t agriculturally productive. The elite peoples of the earth, who include the wicked of Jehovah&rsquo;s people (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc2OTgiOjZ9LHsiMTgxMzYiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 2:12-17; 26:5<\/a>), are his prime target, as these he plunders and despoils (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc4NTYiOjJ9LHsiMTc4NTYiOjN9LHsiMTgyODEiOjF9LHsiMTgyODEiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 10:5-6, Isaiah 10:5-6, 14; 33:1; 33:1<\/a>).<\/p>",
