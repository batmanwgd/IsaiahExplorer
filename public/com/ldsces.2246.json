    "html": "<p>The prophet contrasts their former beauty with the results of judgment. Because of their wickedness, the beauty, the pride, and the fashion will become tragedy, disaster, and slavery. The girdle in verse 24 was the sash used to fasten the outer clothing. Keil and Delitzsch showed that the &ldquo;rent&rdquo; which was to replace it was the rope used to bind slaves. Sackcloth was black goat&rsquo;s hair worn at times of great mourning. The &ldquo;burning&rdquo; refers to the branding that often accompanied one&rsquo;s being made a slave. Thus Keil and Delitzsch translated this verse: &ldquo;And instead of balmy scent there will be mouldiness, and instead of the sash, a rope, and instead of artistic ringlets a baldness, and instead of the dress cloak a frock of sackcloth, branding instead of beauty&rdquo; (<em>Commentary,<\/em> 7:1:147).<\/p><p class=\"cite\"> LDS Church Educational System Old Testament Student Manual, 1 Kings&ndash;Malachi, Religion 302, Chapter 13, Item 22<\/p> ",
