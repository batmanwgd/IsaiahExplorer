    "html": "<p><i> Therefore the Lord will cut off from Israel.<\/i> He intimates that God\u2019s vengeance will be universal, and will involve all ranks; for the whole nation was corrupted, and the contagion had spread over the whole country, to such an extent that no part was left whole or sound. Now, when iniquity thus abounds, every one flatters himself, and they think that they have concealed themselves by an admirable veil, because they have many who are like them; and when they compare themselves with others, they think that they have pleaded their excuse. This is the reason why he threatens that vengeance generally against all; for not one was free from the general disease.<\/p> \n<p><i> Head and tail, branch and reed.<\/i> By<i> branch<\/i> he means the stronger and more powerful; by<i> reed<\/i> or<i> rush<\/i> he means the feebler, that is, men of the lowest rank, and who had scarcely any wealth. He therefore means that the vengeance of God hangs over them, and spares neither the strong nor the weak, neither the highest nor the lowest, because no part is sound or uninfected by the general disease.<\/p> ",
