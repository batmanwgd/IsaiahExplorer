    "html": "<p>Having been unsuccessful in his efforts to persuade King Ahaz to put his trust in the Lord rather than in the Assyrians, Isaiah next turns his attention to the people of Judah. He repeats the assurance given in the previous chapter to their king that in a very short time Syria and the northern kingdom (Ephraim or Israel) will be destroyed. However, the faith of the people is as shortsighted as their royal ruler, and as a consequence Isaiah prophesies that the Assyrians will invade the southern kingdom of Judah.<\/p>     <p>Ultimately, Judah's enemies will be punished for their aggression. A remnant of Judah will survive, \"for God is with us,\" declared Isaiah.<\/p>     <p>The prophet relates the Lord's personal counsel to him that he should not get caught up in the persuasions or fears of the people. Let God be your refuge and sanctuary, the prophet is told. Isaiah is informed that the wicked will stumble over the Lord's teachings. The apostle Peter would later teach this same concept: \"Unto you therefore which believe he [the Lord Jesus Christ] is precious: but unto them which be disobedient \u2026 a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence, even to them which stumble at the word, being disobedient.\" (<a class=\"ref\">1 Peter 2:7-8<\/a>.)<\/p>     <p>Isaiah is told to record his testimony, and he testifies of his willingness to follow the Lord. He concludes the chapter with warnings against seeking spiritual help from the wrongsources. God is the only source of light. Those who seek elsewhere will find themselves immersed in darkness.<\/p>",
