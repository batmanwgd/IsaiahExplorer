Jacob casts a different light on this prophecy of Isaiah. In <a class=\"ref\">2 Ne. 10:5-9<\/a> he explains that when the Jews come to believe in Christ, they will be \"gathered in from their long dispersion,&hellip;and the nations of the Gentiles shall be great in the eyes of me, saith God, in carrying them forth to the lands of their inheritance. Yea, the kings of the Gentiles shall be nursing fathers unto them, and their queens shall become nursing mothers\" (see also 45:14; 49:7; 60:4).<\/p> <p>One interpretation of these words was given by Elder Spencer W. Kimball: \"The brighter day has dawned. The scattering has been accomplished; the gathering is in process. May the Lord bless us all as we become nursing fathers and mothers (see <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NjYwXQ==\">Isa. 49:23<\/a> and <a class=\"ref\">1 Ne. 21:23<\/a>) unto our Lamanite brethren and hasten the fulfillment of the great promises made to them.\" The kings and queens may well be the righteous men and women who have entered into the covenants of the fulness of the priesthood in the temple of God.<\/p> ",
