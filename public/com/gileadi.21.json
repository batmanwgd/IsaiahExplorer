    "html": "<p>As the Hebrew term &ldquo;silver&rdquo; (<em>kesep<\/em>) additionally means &ldquo;money,&rdquo; its meaning here points to a worthless or devalued currency. Products such as wine, too, lack the quality they once had. Isaiah, however, intends more than a literal meaning of these terms. His imagery of common, semi-precious, and precious metals and stones, for example, denotes three ascending spiritual categories of people (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 60:17<\/a>). In other words, some people who were in an elect category (&ldquo;silver&rdquo;) have become &ldquo;dross,&rdquo; which isn&rsquo;t a metal at all. Having fallen from grace, they have joined Isaiah&rsquo;s Perdition category.<\/p><p><em>Your wine diluted with water.<\/em> Besides its literal meaning, the idea of &ldquo;wine&rdquo; metaphorically signifies spiritual nourishment: &ldquo;You who have no money, come, buy wine and milk with no money and at no cost&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 55:1<\/a>). Those who teach God&rsquo;s word, in effect, have watered it down until it no longer nourishes his people: &ldquo;Their heart ponders impiety&mdash;how to practice hypocrisy and preach perverse things concerning Jehovah, leaving the hungry soul empty, depriving the thirsty [soul] of drink&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 32:6<\/a>). What passes for God&rsquo;s word has become but a diminished version of his gospel in its fullness.<\/p>",
