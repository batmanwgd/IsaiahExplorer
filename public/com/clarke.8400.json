The empneumatosis, or windy inflation of the womb, is a disorder to which females are liable. Some have had this in such wise, for a long time together, that they have appeared to themselves, and even to very skillful medical men, to be pregnant; and after having endured much pain, and even the throes of apparent childbearing, they have been eased and restored to health by the emission of a great quantity of wind from the uterus. This disorder is well known to medical men. \"The Syriac translator seems to have understood it in this manner: <i>Enixi sumus, ut illae quae ventos pariunt <\/i>. \"We have brought forth as they who bring forth wind.\" <\/p> \n\n <p> <em>In the earth \"In the land\"\u2014 <\/em> <span class=\"greek-hebrew\"> \u05d1\u05d0\u05e8\u05e5 <\/span> <span class=\"translit\"> bearets <\/span>; so a MS., the Septuagint, Syriac, and Vulgate. <\/p> ",
