    "html": "<p> So irrational is idolatry; but yet, through self-hardening, they have fallen under the judgment of hardness of heart (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc3NzkiOjJ9LFsxODAwOCwxODIwNF1d\">Isaiah 6:9-10; Isaiah 19:3; Isaiah 29:10<\/a>), and have been given up to a reprobate mind (<a class=\"ref\">Romans 1:28<\/a>). <em> \u201cThey perceive not, and do not understand: for their eyes are smeared over, so that they do not see; their hearts, so that they do not understand. And men take it not to heart, no perception and no understanding, that men should say, The half of it I have burned in the fire, and also baked bread upon the coals thereof; roasted flesh, and eaten: and ought I to make the rest of it an abomination, to fall down before the produce of a tree?\u201d<\/em> Instead of \u05d8\u05d7 , <a class=\"ref\">Leviticus 14:42<\/a>, the third person is written \u05d8\u05d7 (from <em> ta\u0302chach <\/em> , Ges. \u00a772, Anm. 8) in a circumstantial sense: their eyes are, as it were, smeared over with plaster. The expression \u05d0\u05dc\u05be\u05dc\u05d1 \u05d4\u05e9\u05c1\u05d9\u05d1 or \u05e2\u05dc\u05be\u05dc\u05d1 (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NTk1XQ==\">Isaiah 46:8<\/a>), literally to carry back into the heart, which we find as well as \u05e2\u05dc\u05be\u05dc\u05d1 \u05e9\u05c2\u05d9\u05dd , to take to heart (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NTA2XQ==\">Isaiah 42:25<\/a>), answers exactly to the idea of reflection, here with reference to the immense contrast between a piece of wood and the Divine Being. The second and third \u05dc\u05d0 in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NTUzXQ==\">Isaiah 44:19<\/a> introduce substantive clauses, just as verbal clauses are introduced by \u05d5\u05d0\u05d9\u05df . \u05dc\u05d0\u05de\u05e8 is used in the same manner as in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODM4XQ==\">Isaiah 9:8<\/a> : \u201cperception and insight showing themselves in their saying.\u201d On <em> bu\u0304l <\/em> , see <a class=\"ref\">Job 40:20<\/a>; the meaning \u201cblock\u201d cannot be established: the talmudic <em> bu\u0304l <\/em> , a lump or piece, which Ewald adduces, is the Greek \u03b2\u03c9\u0342\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 .<\/p>",
