back?<\/p>     <\/blockquote>     <h4>Original Meaning<\/h4>     <p>I<small>SAIAH<\/small> 14 C<small>ONTINUES<\/small> the general pronouncement of judgment on creaturely pride, using Babylon as a vehicle. Here, after some words of encouragement to Israel (vv. 1\u20134a), Isaiah focuses on the downfall of the so-called \u201cking of Babylon\u201d (vv. 4b\u201321). The section on Babylon then closes with a statement from God on what it is he is doing to the Mesopotamian powers (vv. 22\u201327).<\/p>     <p>\u2003Students of this passage have long been aware that much more than some individual human monarch is being talked about. Just as in Ezekiel 28, where the fall of the \u201cking of Tyre\u201d is discussed, the language is much too sweeping and expressive to be talking only about one human being. As a result, some of the church fathers understood this passage and Ezekiel 28 to be primarily talking about Satan (see esp. Isa. 14:12\u201315). John Milton drew on this exegesis for his epic poem, <em>Paradise Lost<\/em>. However, the great expositors of the Reformation, Luther and Calvin, do not support this latter interpretation, arguing that the passage is discussing human pride, not angelic pride. We actually know very little about Satan\u2019s origins from the Bible, especially if Revelation 12:8\u20139 are discussing events at the end of time and not those before time began. Jesus tells us that he saw Satan fall (Luke 10:18), but beyond that we have little other information.<\/p>     <p>\u2003It is generally agreed that the poem in Isaiah 14:4b\u201321 is one of the finest in the Hebrew language. The four stanzas are set up as a \u201clament,\u201d a song mourning the death of someone, with the typical meter of a lament and much of the typical vocabulary. The first stanza (vv. 4b\u20138) considers earth\u2019s reaction to the death; the second (vv. 9\u201311), the underworld\u2019s response; the third (vv. 12\u201315), heaven\u2019s perspective; finally (vv. 16\u201321), a return to contemplate the dead person\u2019s tragic fate on earth. But this is not a typical lament. Far from it! It is a biting parody of a lament. Instead of expressing grief over the death of the tyrant, it expresses both delight and satisfaction. Death is welcomed as the leveler of the tyrant\u2019s proud and oppressive ambition.<\/p>     ",
