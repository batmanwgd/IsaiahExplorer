Hunter as an example of the \"perfect peace\" which is not understood by the world, but which comes through a belief in God (see CR, Oct. 1966, p. 15). The context of this verse is the time when Judah in Jerusalem will trust in Jehovah and thus experience this perfect peace. Consequently, it describes the day of Judah's restoration.<\/p>     ",
