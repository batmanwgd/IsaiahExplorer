That progression coincides with Jehovah&rsquo;s <em>righteousness <\/em>,being &ldquo;brought near&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NjAwXQ==\">Isaiah 46:13 <\/a>), to some persons becoming &ldquo;followers&rdquo; of <em>righteousness <\/em>,(<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4Njc1XQ==\">v 1 <\/a>), and to their coming to &ldquo;know&rdquo; <em>righteousness <\/em>,(<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NjgxXQ==\">v 7 <\/a>). Their knowing him signifies a covenant relationship with Jehovah&rsquo;s servant who personifies Jehovah&rsquo;s <em>covenant <\/em>,(<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDg3LDE4NjQ1LDE4NzQ0XQ==\">Isaiah 42:6; 49:8; 55:3 <\/a>). When people reach that spiritual stage, however, they inevitably incur ridicule and reproach. <\/p> <p>Two choices thus face humanity: (1) to emulate the servant&rsquo;s righteousness, which leads to persecution by enemies; or (2) to reject Jehovah&rsquo;s standard of righteousness as exemplified by his servant and suffer covenant curses (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgxNDEiOjJ9LHsiMTg1MDUiOjJ9XQ==\">Isaiah 26:10-11; 42:24-25 <\/a>). Being devoured by moths&mdash;a chaos motif&mdash;forms a word link to the servant&rsquo;s enemies being devoured by moths (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NjcyXQ==\">Isaiah 50:9 <\/a>). His enemies, in other words, are their enemies. When Jehovah reverses his people&rsquo;s circumstances, however, their <em>righteousness <\/em>,ensures their <em>salvation <\/em>,, literally and figuratively, by an everlasting covenant (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODg1MSI6NX0=\">Isaiah 61:7-11 <\/a>). <\/p>,",
