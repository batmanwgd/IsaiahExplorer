McConkie and John H. Vandenberg in CR, Apr. 1973, pp. 29, 34.) The same idea is found in <a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 50:10-12<\/a>. Occasionally verse 18 is used to show that an individual can be cleansed from sin. Although a nation cannot repent unless the individuals within that nation repent, individual repentance is not the context of this passage in Isaiah. as interpreted by President Joseph Fielding Smith:<\/p>     <blockquote>This quotation from Isaiah is quite generally misunderstood. It is clear from a careful reading of this first chapter m Isaiah, that this remark had no reference to individuals at all, but to the House of Israel ....<\/blockquote>     <blockquote>... So we see that this passage does not apply to individuals and individual sins. (AQ, 2:179-80.)<\/blockquote>     ",
