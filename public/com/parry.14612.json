Solomon, for instance, \"spread forth his hands toward heaven\" (<a class=\"ref\">1 Kgs. 8:22<\/a>) as he uttered the dedicatory prayer of the temple of Solomon. Other references to this temple practice include <a class=\"ref\">Ps. 28:2; 63:4<\/a>; and 134:2.<\/p> <p><i>hide mine eyes\/will not hear.<\/i> God will not consider the apostate temple rites and ceremonials to be efficacious, nor is he pleased by correct performances offered by wicked people.<\/p> <p> <i>hands are full of blood.<\/i> Here, hands symbolize the whole person, the agent who commits evil deeds (<a class=\"ref\">Ps. 7:3; 26:10<\/a>). Israel spread forth her hands toward God in an act of prayer, but God saw that her hands were <i>full of blood,<\/i> representative of gross iniquity (such as murder or bloodshed; <a class=\"ref\">Alma 5:22-25<\/a>). Isaiah employs similar imagery elsewhere in his writings (2:8; 17:8; 37:19; 59:3, 6).<\/p> ",
