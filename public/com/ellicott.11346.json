The outward imagery probably had its starting-point in the processions of the pilgrims who came up to the Temple singing psalms, like those known as the \u201csongs of degrees\u201d at their successive halting-places (Psalms 120-134). <\/p>\n <p>Sorrow and sighing shall flee away.\u2014The words have a special interest as being the closing utterance of Isaiah\u2019s political activity, written, therefore, probably, in his old age, and in the midst of much trouble, whether he wrote at the close of Hezekiah\u2019s reign, or the beginning of Manasseh\u2019s, which must have been sufficiently dark and gloomy. (See <a class=\"ref\">2 Chronicles 32:26; 2 Chronicles 33:1-10<\/a>.) The hopes of the prophet were, however, inextinguishable, and they formed a natural starting-point for the words: \u201cComfort ye, comfort ye, my people,\u201d with which the second collection opens, the intermediate chapters being obviously of the nature of an historical appendix. They find their echo in <a class=\"ref\">Revelation 7:17<\/a>, \u201cGod shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.\u201d <\/p>",
