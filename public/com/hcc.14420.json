    "html": "<p><i>Edom. <\/i> Edom and Bosra (a strong city of Edom) are here taken in a mystical sense for the enemies of Christ and his Church. (Challoner)&mdash; St. Jerome with reason finds it difficult to explain it of Christ, as it regards the Machabees. (Houbigant)&mdash; The first six verses are applied to our Saviour's ascension, which excites the admiration of angels, Psalm xxiii. 7. Judas, the Machabee, the glorious figure of Christ, is introduced speaking in this and the following chapter. He conquered Idumea, (1 Machabees v. 3., and 2 Machabees x. 10.) and fought<i>to save<\/i> the people, 1 Machabees ix. 21. (Calmet)&mdash; The highest order of angels asks this question, admiring the beauty of Christ, though imbrued in blood after his victory. (St. Dionysius, Hierar. vii.) (Worthington)<\/p> ",
