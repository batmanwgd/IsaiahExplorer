    "html": "<p> Just as in  , <em> k\u0131\u0304 <\/em> (for), with all that follows, assigns the reason for the encouraging \u201cFear not;\u201d so here a second <em> k\u0131\u0304 <\/em> introduces the reason for the promise which ensures them against the dangers arising from either water or fire. <em> \u201cFor I Jehovah am thy God; <\/em> (<em> I<\/em> )<em> the Holy One of Israel, thy Saviour: I give up Egypt as a ransom for thee, Ethiopia and Seba in thy stead. Because thou art dear in my eyes, highly esteemed, and I loved thee; I give up men in thy stead, and peoples for thy life.\u201d<\/em> Both \u201cJehovah\u201d and \u201cthe Holy One of Israel\u201d are in apposition to <em> \u201cI\u201d<\/em> (<em> ' a\u0306n\u0131\u0304 <\/em> ), the force of which is continued in the second clause. The preterite <em> na\u0302thatt\u0131\u0304 <\/em> (I have given), as the words \u201cI will give\u201d in  clearly show, states a fact which as yet is only completed so far as the purpose is concerned. \u201c<em> A ransom:<\/em> \u201d <em> ko\u0304pher <\/em> ( \u03bb\u03c5\u0301\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd ) is literally the covering - the person making the payment. \u05e1\u05d1\u05d0 is the land of <em> Mero\u00eb<\/em> , which is enclosed between the White and Blue Nile, the present <em> D\u00e2r<\/em> <em> Senn\u00e2r<\/em> , district of <em> Senn\u00e2r<\/em> (<em> Sen-\u00e2rti<\/em> , i.e., island of <em> Sen\u00e2<\/em> ), or the ancient Meriotic priestly state settled about this enclosed land, probably included in the <em> Mudr\u00e2ya<\/em> (Egypt) of the Achaemenidian arrowheaded inscriptions; though it is uncertain whether the <em> Kusiya<\/em> (Heb. <em> Ku\u0304sh\u0131\u0304m <\/em> ) mentioned there are the predatory tribe of archers called \u039a\u03bf\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u03b9\u0342\u03bf\u03b9 (Strabo, xi. 13, 6), whose name has been preserved in the present Chuzistan, the eastern Ethiopians of the Greeks (as Lassen and Rawlinson suppose), or the African Ethiopians of the Bible, as Oppert imagines. The fact that Egypt was only conquered by Cambyses, and not by Cyrus, who merely planned it (Herod. i. 153), and to whom it is only attributed by a legend (Xen. <em> Cyr<\/em> . viii. 6, 20, \u03bb\u03b5\u0313\u03b3\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b5\u0313\u03c8\u03c3\u03b1\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9 \u0391\u03b9\u0313\u03b3\u03c5\u03c0\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd ), does no violence to the truth of the promise. It is quite enough that Egypt and the neighbouring kingdoms were subjugated by the new imperial power of Persia, and that through that empire the Jewish people recovered their long-lost liberty. The free love of God was the reason for His treating Israel according to the principle laid down in <a class=\"ref\">Proverbs 11:8; Proverbs 21:18<\/a>. \u05de\u05d0\u05e9\u05c1\u05e8 does not signify <em> ex quo tempore <\/em> here, but is equivalent to \u05d0\u05e9\u05c1\u05e8 \u05de\u05e4\u05bc\u05e0\u05d9 in <a class=\"ref\">Exodus 19:18; Jeremiah 44:23<\/a>; for if it indicated the <em> terminus a quo <\/em> , it would be followed by a more distinct statement of the fact of their election. The personal pronoun \u201cand I\u201d (<em> va'a\u0306n\u0131\u0304 <\/em> ) is introduced in consequence of the change of persons. In the place of \u05d5\u05e0\u05ea\u05ea\u05bc\u05d9 (<em> perf. cons.<\/em> ), \u05d5\u05d0\u05ea\u05bc \u05df commended itself, as the former had already been used in a somewhat different function. All that composed the chosen nation are here designated as \u201cman\u201d (<em> a\u0302da\u0302m <\/em> ), because there was nothing in them but what was derived from Adam. \u05ea\u05bc\u05d7\u05ea has here a strictly substitutionary meaning throughout.<\/p>",
