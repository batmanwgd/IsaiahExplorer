    "html": " <p>As prefigured by Eliakim&rsquo;s succession of Shebna, Jehovah appoints his end-time servant as an integral part of the reversal of circumstances that occurs in Jehovah&rsquo;s Day of Judgment. The verbs &ldquo;commission&rdquo; or &ldquo;call&rdquo; (<em>qara&rsquo;<\/em>) and &ldquo;appoint&rdquo; (<em>natan<\/em>) form word links to Jehovah&rsquo;s &ldquo;calling&rdquo; and &ldquo;appointing&rdquo; his servant (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDc5LDE4NDg3LDE4NjMwLDE4NjM4LDE4NjQzLDE4NjQ1LDE4NzQ1XQ==\">Isaiah 41:27; 42:6; 48:15; 49:1, 6, 8; 55:4<\/a>). While the word &ldquo;servant&rdquo; denotes a vassal relationship to Jehovah under the terms of the Davidic Covenant, the word &ldquo;father&rdquo; signifies the servant&rsquo;s role as a proxy savior. That role here involves sealing keys that pertain to Isaiah&rsquo;s seraph category. <\/p> ",
