    "html": " <i>He will<\/i><b> <\/b><i>swallow up death in victory.<\/i> Christ victoriously overcame death at his resurrection and made it possible for us also to swallow up death in victory. Paul quoted this passage: \"So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory&hellip;. Thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ\" (<a class=\"ref\">1 Cor. 15:54-57<\/a>; see also <a class=\"ref\">Hel. 14:14-18<\/a>). <\/p> <p><i>Lord God will<\/i> <i>wipe away tears. <\/i>Tears come from the pain and sorrow associated with mortality, affliction, pain, death, and personal sin. When he dwells with us after his coming, Jesus Christ, who is well acquainted with grief (53:3), will remove the pains of our mortality (<a class=\"ref\">Rev. 7:17; 21:4<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 101:29<\/a>). <\/p> <p><i>for the Lord hath spoken it.<\/i> God is the source of this revelation, and it will therefore surely come to pass.<\/p> ",
