    "html": "<p> The prophet then continues in the language of prediction. <em> \u201cThey that see thee look, considering thee, look at thee thoughtfully: Is this the man that set the earth trembling, and kingdoms shaking? that made the world a wilderness, and destroyed its cities, and did not release its prisoners <\/em> (<em> to their<\/em> )<em> home?\u201d<\/em> The scene is no longer in Hades (Knobel, Umbreit). Those who are speaking thus have no longer the Chaldean before them as a mere shade, but as an unburied corpse that has fallen into corruption. As <em> te\u0304be\u0304l <\/em> is feminine, the suffixes in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3OTQ2XQ==\">Isaiah 14:17<\/a> must refer, according to a <em> constructio ad sensum <\/em> , to the world as changed into a <em> wilderness<\/em> (<em> m idba\u0302r <\/em> ). <em> Pa\u0302thach <\/em> , to open, namely locks and fetters; here, with <em> baitha\u0302h <\/em> , it is equivalent to releasing or letting go (syn. <em> shille\u0304ach <\/em> , <a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 50:33<\/a>). By the \u201cprisoners\u201d the Jewish exiles are principally intended; and it was their release that had never entered the mind of the king of Babylon.<\/p>",
