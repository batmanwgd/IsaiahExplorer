This he adds, because the Israelites, having weakened the Jews, and being in amity with the Syrians, their next neighbours, were secure. <i>To whom will ye flee for help <\/i>\u2014 To the Syrians, as now you do? But they shall be destroyed together with you, <a class=\"ref\">2 Kings 16:9<\/a>; <i>and where will you leave your glory <\/i>\u2014 To be kept safe for your use, and to be restored to you when you call for it? By their <i>glory, <\/i>he means, either, 1st, their power and authority, which now they so wickedly abused; or, 2d, their wealth, gotten by injustice, as <i>glory <\/i>sometimes means: see <a class=\"ref\">Genesis 31:1; Psalms 49:16-17<\/a>. <i>Without me <\/i>\u2014 Without my favour and help, which you have forfeited, and do not seek to recover; <i>they shall bow down <\/i>\u2014 Notwithstanding all their succours; <i>under the prisoners <\/i>\u2014 Or among the prisoners; <i>and they shall fall under the slain <\/i>\u2014 Or among the slain. The meaning is, that it was in vain for the Israelites to trust in their own strength, or in the assistance of the Syrians, or any other allies, since it was from God alone they could obtain deliverance, without whose aid, or when he deserted them, they should all bow down under the yoke of the Assyrians. In the Septuagint, and vulgar Latin, these words are joined to the foregoing verse, to this sense: \u201cWhither will this people flee for refuge to preserve themselves, that they may not bow down, or be subdued among the captives, or destroyed among the slain?\u201d<\/p>",
