    "html": "<p>The virtual repetition of <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzY1NiI6MzF9\">verse 11<\/a> reiterates that it is principally <em>people<\/em> and the things in which they take pride that Jehovah lays low; while, on the other hand, he says, &ldquo;My anger is not upon those who take pride in me&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 13:3<\/a>). A reversal of parts of <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzY1NiI6MzF9\">verses 11<\/a> and 17 shows that these and many concepts Isaiah presents in parallel are synonymous and interchangeable. Consistent with Isaiah&rsquo;s pattern of humiliation before exaltation and exaltation before humiliation, moreover, even the righteous are first humbled before being exalted, whereas the wicked who exalt themselves are humbled in the end.<\/p>",
