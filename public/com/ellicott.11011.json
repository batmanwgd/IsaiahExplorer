The \u201cdaughters of Moab\u201d either literally, the women driven from their homes, or figuratively (as in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3OTcxXQ==\">Isaiah 16:1<\/a>) the whole population of its towns and villages, are represented as fluttering in terror, like birds whose nests are spoiled (comp. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODY1XQ==\">Isaiah 10:14<\/a>), like the fledglings in the nest, on the fords of Arnon, uncertain whether to return to their old homes or to cross into a strange land. The imagery reminds us of <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 11:1, Proverbs 27:8<\/a>, so also of \u00c6sch. Agam. 49-52. <\/p>",
