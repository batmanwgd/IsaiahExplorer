    "html": "<p><em>Acquainted with grief -<\/em>For <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d5\u05d9\u05d3\u05d5\u05e2 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">vidua<\/span>, familiar with grief, eight MSS. and one edition have <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d5\u05d9\u05e8\u05e2 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">veyada<\/span>, and knowing grief; the Septuagint, Syriac, and Vulgate read it <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d5\u05d9\u05d5\u05d3\u05e2 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">veyodea<\/span> .<\/p>\n\n<p><em>We hid as it were our faces from him \"As one that hideth his face from us\" -<\/em>For <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d5\u05db\u05de\u05e1\u05ea\u05e8 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">uchemaster<\/span>, four MSS. (two ancient) have <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d5\u05db\u05de\u05e1\u05ea\u05d9\u05e8 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">uchemastir<\/span>, one MS. <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d5\u05de\u05e1\u05ea\u05d9\u05e8 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">umastir<\/span> . For <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05e4\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">panim<\/span>, two MSS. have <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05e4\u05e0\u05d9\u05d5 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">panaiu<\/span> ; so likewise the Septuagint and Vulgate. Mourners covered up the lower part of their faces, and their heads,  <a class=\"ref\">2 Samuel 15:30;  Ezekiel 29:17<\/a>; and lepers were commanded by the law,  <a class=\"ref\">Leviticus 13:45<\/a>, to cover their upper lip. From which circumstance it seems that the Vulgate, Aquila, Symmachus, and the Jewish commentators have taken the word <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05e0\u05d2\u05d5\u05e2 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">nagua<\/span>, stricken, in the next verse, as meaning stricken with the leprosy: <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u03b5\u03bd \u03b1\u03c6\u03b7\u0345 \u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1<\/span>, Sym.; <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u03b1\u03c6\u03b7\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd<\/span>, Aq.; leprosum, Vulg. So my old MS. Bible. I will insert the whole passage as curious: - <\/p>\n\n<p>   There is not schap to him, ne fairnesse,<\/p>\n\n<p>  And we seegen him, and he was not of sigte,<\/p>\n\n<p>And we desiriden him dispisid; and the last of men:<\/p>\n\n<p>Man of souaris and witing infirmitie;<\/p>\n\n<p>And he hid his cheer and despisid;<\/p>\n\n<p>Wherfor ne we settiden bi him:<\/p>\n\n<p>Verili our seeknesse he toke and our sorewis he bair,<\/p>\n\n<p>And we helden him as leprous and smyten of God, and meekid;<\/p>\n\n<p>He forsoth wounded is for our wickednesse,<\/p>\n\n<p>Defoulid is for our hidous giltis<\/p>\n\n<p>The discipline of our pese upon him,<\/p>\n\n<p>   And with his wanne wound we ben helid.<\/p>",
