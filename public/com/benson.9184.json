For the expressions here are too strong to be applied to any other calamity than the great and final one, when the Jews were carried captives to Babylon;\u201d<\/p> \n<p>of which the prophet had a clear foresight.<i> Look away from me<\/i> \u2014 Take off your eyes and thoughts from me, and leave me alone, that I may take my fill of sorrow.<i> Labour not to comfort me<\/i> \u2014 For all your labour will be lost. I neither can nor will receive any consolation.<i> Because of the spoiling,<\/i> &c. \u2014 Of that city and nation, whereof I am a member. The title of<i> daughter<\/i> is often given both to cities and nations, as hath been observed before.<i> For it is a day of treadling down<\/i> \u2014 In which my people are trodden under foot by their insolent enemies;<i> and of perplexity by the Lord of hosts<\/i> \u2014 This is added, partly to show, that this did not happen without God\u2019s providence; and partly to aggravate their calamity, because, not only men, but God himself fought against them;<i> breaking down the walls<\/i> \u2014 Of the strong cities of Judah; which was done both by Sennacherib and by Nebuchadnezzar;<i> and of crying to the mountains<\/i> \u2014 With such loud and dismal outcries as should reach to the neighbouring mountains. \u201cWho does not see,\u201d says Vitringa, \u201cin Isaiah, thus weeping over Jerusalem, a type of Jesus weeping over this same city in its last extremity?\u201d<\/p> ",
