The purpose of the Lord's chastisement of the people Israel, as always, is to cause them to turn back to him. When they do, he blesses and delivers them (<a class=\"ref\">Judg. 2:16<\/a>; see <a class=\"ref\">Job 36:10-12<\/a>). <\/p> <p><i>Where is he&hellip;? <\/i>After remembering how Jehovah saved the people during the Exodus, the people now long for his saving presence in their lives, for his guidance, for his loving comfort and tenderness (<a class=\"ref\">Jer. 2:6<\/a>). <\/p> <p><i>out of the sea.<\/i> The Lord delivered Israel by miraculous means, taking them through the Red Sea. He does the same with us, bringing us safely past seemingly impassable obstacles in our lives.<\/p> <p><i>shepherd of his flock.<\/i> Moses was the shepherd the Lord used to bring his flock (the Israelites) through the Red Sea to safety (<a class=\"ref\">Ps. 77:19-20; Micah 6:4<\/a>). Ultimately, of course, the good shepherd for us all is Christ (<a class=\"ref\">John 10:14<\/a>). <\/p> <p><i>put his holy Spirit within him.<\/i> The <i>him<\/i> used here seems to refer to Moses, the shepherd, rather than to Israel, the flock. Moses was blessed with the Spirit (<a class=\"ref\">Num. 11:17,  25<\/a>). <\/p> ",
