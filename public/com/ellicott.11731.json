Looking to the Manasseh-surroundings of the passage, however, it is more natural to refer the words to the king, the great king of Assyria, whose religion Judah had basely and shamefully adopted. The sin of Ahaz (<a class=\"ref\">2 Kings 16:11<\/a>) had been reproduced by his grandson. The description that follows is that of a harlot adorning herself for her evil calling, and finds its best illustration in <a class=\"ref\">Proverbs 7:14-17<\/a>. Looking to the previous traces of Isaiah\u2019s study of that book (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzg4NiI6NH0=\">Isaiah 11:1-4<\/a>, &c) we may, perhaps, find in it a deliberate reproduction of that passage. The \u201cointment\u201d and \u201cperfumes\u201d are symbols of the treasures which were lavished to secure the Assyrian alliance. The words help us to understand Isaiah\u2019s indignation at what must have seemed to him the initial step of a like policy on the part of Hezekiah (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODQxNiI6NX0=\">Isaiah 39:3-7<\/a>). The words which point to the \u201cfar-off\u201d land, to which the messengers were sent, seem almost like an echo from that king\u2019s apology. <\/p>\n <p>Even unto hell\u2014i.e., Hades or Sheol, the world of the dead\u2014as the symbol of an abysmal depth of degradation. <\/p>",
