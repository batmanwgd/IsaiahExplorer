    "html": " <p> <em>And judgment is turned away backward <\/em>&mdash;The word &lsquo;judgment&rsquo; is not used, as in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODEwXQ==\">Isaiah 59:9 <\/a>,, to denote the divine interposition to avenge and deliver them, but it is used in the sense of justice, or lust decisions between man and man. The verse contains a further confession of the evil of their course of life; and, among other things, they acknowledged that they had been unjust in their legal decisions. They had been influenced by partiality and by bribes; they had condemned the innocent, they had acquitted the guilty. Judgment had thus been lumped back by their sins when it seemed to be approaching and entering the city. <\/p> <p> <em>And justice standeth afar off <\/em>&mdash;This is a beautiful figure. justice is represented as standing at a distance from the city. Deterred by their sins, it would not enter. They prevented its approach, and it was unknown among them. <\/p> <p> <em>For truth is fallen in the street <\/em>&mdash;Or rather, perhaps, in the gate&mdash;the place where justice was administered. The language here is all taken from courts of justice, and the idea is, that there was no justice in their decisions, but that their courts were unprincipled and corrupt. <\/p> <p> <em>And equity cannot enter <\/em>&mdash;It stood at a distance, and the impenetrable mass of guilt effectually prevented its approach to the capital. <\/p>,",
