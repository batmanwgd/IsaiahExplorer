    "html": " <p><i>Isaiah's words remind us that it is a privilege to be a descendant of that great patriarch Israel and a recipient of the blessings attendant on that heritage (44:3). Isaiah prophesies that the Lord's Spirit will be poured out upon Israel's seed abundantly, as \"floods upon the dry ground.\" We who are of Israel will be pleased to say, \"I am the Lord's.\" We will be happy to proclaim, \"I have the name of Jacob,\" or \"my surname is Israel.\"<\/i><\/p> <p><i>In ancient days, Israel was in bondage to an earthly conqueror, but God called up a deliverer (Cyrus) to rescue his people. We also are in bondage, but our enslavement is to the powers of sin, tradition, and death. In his great power, God has sent us a deliverer in Jesus Christ. He has the power to liberate us from our bondage and to set us free spiritually, if we will but turn to him and hearken with honest hearts. But to receive his blessing, we must be willing to submit to him, even as the clay does to the potter.<\/i><\/p> ",
