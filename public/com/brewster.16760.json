Wise Solomon said it well when he stated, \"Who hath woe? who hath sorrow? \u2026 They that tarry long at the wine.\" (<a class=\"ref\">Proverbs 23:29-30<\/a>.) This woe is not confined to drunks, but is an indictment of all who insatiably pursue raucous and riotous living. They pursue pleasure (\"in their feasts\") from \"early in the morning \u2026 until night \u2026 but they regard not the work of the Lord.\"<\/p>",
