His people, too, however, ascend to glory: &ldquo;From a sector of the earth we hear singing: &lsquo;Glorious are the righteous!&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgxMTIiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 24:16<\/a>); &ldquo;In that day the plant of Jehovah shall be beautiful and glorious, and the earth&rsquo;s fruit the pride and glory of the survivors of Israel&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc3MzYiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 4:2<\/a>). The servant&rsquo;s establishing righteousness among Jehovah&rsquo;s people leads to their attaining higher spiritual levels, as signified by the new name he gives them (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg3NTkiOjF9LHsiMTg5MTMiOjF9LHsiMTg5NDUiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 56:5; 65:15; 66:22<\/a>) with its accompanying new commission.<\/p>",
