In commenting on Isaiah's words, Nephi declared that ancient Babylon would be destroyed and that the Jews would therefore be \"scattered by other nations\" (<a class=\"ref\">2 Ne. 25:15<\/a>). Elder LeGrand Richards quoted this passage as Isaiah's prophecy of the destruction of ancient Babylon, noting that Elders Spencer W. Kimball and Howard W. Hunter had visited the sites in 1961 and had seen the destruction (see CR, Oct. 1966, p. 42).<\/p>     ",
