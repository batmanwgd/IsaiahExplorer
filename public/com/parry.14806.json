In this particular judgment against the Northern Kingdom (9:8-10:4), however, the widows and fatherless are as guilty as their leaders and false prophets, for the Lord does not have joy or mercy even for those who are socially rejected or have temporal needs; \"every one [of them] is an hypocrite and an evildoer, and every mouth speaketh folly\" (9:17). Certainly the entire nation has been rejected.<\/p> <p><i>mouth speaketh folly.<\/i> The New International Version puts this as \"every mouth speaks vileness.\"<\/p> ",
