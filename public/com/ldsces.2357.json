    "html": " <p>Joseph Smith taught that some men &ldquo;shall rise to the everlasting burnings of God; for God dwells in everlasting burnings, and some shall rise to the damnation of their own filthiness, which is as exquisite a torment as the lake of fire and brimstone&rdquo; (<em>Teachings, <\/em> p. 361; compare <a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 128:24; 130:7; 133:41; Hebrews 12:29 <\/a>). In one of the most beautiful scriptures of the Old Testament, the Lord asked who would be able to abide this devouring fire, and then described the kind of person that would be able to abide it (see <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODI5NCI6Mn0=\">vv. 14&ndash;15 <\/a>). <\/p> <p>Elder Bruce R. McConkie discussed Isaiah&rsquo;s question of &ldquo;who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings?&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4Mjk0XQ==\">v. 14 <\/a>): <\/p> <p>&ldquo;That is, who in the Church shall gain an inheritance in the celestial kingdom? Who will go where God and Christ and holy beings are? Who will overcome the world, work the works of righteousness, and enduring in faith and devotion to the end hear the blessed benediction, &lsquo;Come, and inherit the kingdom of my Father.&rsquo; <\/p> <p>&ldquo;Isaiah answers: [ <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODI5NSI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 33:15&ndash;16 <\/a>.]&rdquo; (In Conference Report, Oct. 1973, p. 55.) <\/p> <p>Elder McConkie continued: <\/p> <p>&ldquo;Now if I may, I shall take these words of Isaiah, spoken by the power of the Holy Ghost in the first instance, and give some indication as to how they apply to us and our circumstances. <\/p> <p>&ldquo;First, &lsquo;He that walketh righteously, and speaketh uprightly.&rsquo; That is, building on the atoning sacrifice of the Lord Jesus Christ, we must keep the commandments. We must speak the truth, and work the works of righteousness. We shall be judged by our thoughts, our words and our deeds. <\/p> <p>&ldquo;Second, &lsquo;&hellip; he that despiseth the gain of oppressions.&rsquo; That is, we must act with equity and justice toward our fellowmen. It is the Lord himself who said that he, at the day of his coming, will be a swift witness against those that oppress the hireling in his wages. <\/p> <p>&ldquo;Third, &lsquo;&hellip; he that shaketh his hands from holding of bribes.&rsquo; That is, we must reject every effort to buy influence, and instead deal fairly and impartially with our fellowmen. God is no respecter of persons. He esteemeth all flesh alike; and those only who keep his commandments find special favor with him. Salvation is free; it cannot be purchased with money; and those only are saved who abide the law upon which its receipt is predicated. Bribery is of the world. <\/p> <p>&ldquo;Fourth, he &lsquo;&hellip; that stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood, and shutteth his eyes from seeing evil.&rsquo; That is, we must not center our attention on evil and wickedness. We must cease to find fault and look for good in government and in the world. We must take an affirmative, wholesome approach to all things.&rdquo; (In Conference Report, Oct. 1973, pp. 55&ndash;56.) <\/p> <p class=\"cite\"> LDS Church Educational System Old Testament Student Manual, 1 Kings&ndash;Malachi, Religion 302, Chapter 15, Item 25 <\/p> ",
