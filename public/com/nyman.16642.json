President David O. McKay, taught that agency is the greatest gift next to life itself (see CR, Oct. 1965, p. 8). Verses 10 through 19 probably preceded verses 1 through 9 in the original text. This conclusion is drawn from the fact that <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODg4NyI6NX0=\">Isaiah 64:1-5<\/a> is quoted in <a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 133<\/a> before <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODg2OCI6OX0=\">Isaiah 63:1-9<\/a> (see <a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 133:40-45<\/a>), and <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODg4NyI6NX0=\">Isaiah 64:1-5<\/a> is a continuation of <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODg3NyI6MTB9\">Isaiah 63:10-19<\/a>. The last part of verse 17 may be a plea for the return of the ten tribes, which is also spoken of in <a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 133:26<\/a>.<\/p>     ",
