The cowardice and effeminacy of the people in general, joined with their fear and trepidation, are here set forth as a second cause of their calamity; and the reason of this, among other things, is drawn from a sense of the divine judgment.<i> They shall be like women, and fear, because of the shaking of the hand of the Lord,<\/i> &c. \u2014 Because they shall perceive that they do not fight with men only, but with the Lord of hosts, who now lifts up his hand against them, as he did against their forefathers.<i> The land of Judah shall be a terror unto Egypt<\/i> \u2014 That is, the calamities brought on the land of Judah by the Assyrians and Chaldeans. When the Egyptians shall hear of the ravages and desolations made in Judah, by the army of Sennacherib, and shall afterward be informed of its overthrow by Nebuchadnezzar, they shall be dreadfully afraid of suffering the same calamities themselves, considering both their near neighbourhood to Judah, and their strict alliance therewith. Indeed Judah was their bulwark against the Assyrians and Babylonians, and when this bulwark was removed they had just cause to fear. \u201cThe threatening hand of God,\u201d says Bishop Lowth, \u201cwill be held out, and shaken over Egypt, from the side of Judea; through which the Assyrians will march to invade it.\u201d<i> Every one that makes mention thereof,<\/i> &c. \u2014 Poole thinks their fear of mentioning Judah\u2019s name might proceed partly from a sense of their guilt and misconduct toward Judah, and an apprehension that the God of Judah was calling them to an account for it. Perhaps, also, as the next clause seems to imply, they might have heard of the prophecies uttered in Judah concerning these very calamities coming upon them.<\/p> ",
