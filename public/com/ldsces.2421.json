    "html": " <p>When Isaiah spoke of the Savior as being a &ldquo;tender plant&rdquo; without form and comeliness, he meant that Jesus was born as a small, helpless infant just as all people are. Jesus grew as other people do. <\/p> <p>President Joseph Fielding Smith wrote: &ldquo;Did not Christ grow up as a tender plant? There was nothing about him to cause people to single him out. In appearance he was like men; and so it is expressed here by the prophet that he had no form or comeliness, that is, he was not so distinctive, so different from others that people would recognize him as the Son of God. He appeared as a mortal man.&rdquo; (<em>Doctrines of Salvation, <\/em> 1:23.) <\/p> <p class=\"cite\"> LDS Church Educational System Old Testament Student Manual, 1 Kings&ndash;Malachi, Religion 302, Chapter 17, Item 21 <\/p> ",
