Rely instead on God, the giver of life. The footnote for this verse (Isaiah 2:22) in your LDS Old Testament says, \"Cease depending on mortal man; he is of little power compared to God.\"  <\/p>  <h4>How Does This Tree Help Me Today?<\/h4>  <p>  The Prophet Joseph Smith taught:  <\/p>  <blockquote>  What was the object of gathering the Jews, or the people of God in any age of the world? . . .  <\/blockquote>  <blockquote>  The main object was to build unto the Lord a house whereby He could reveal unto His people the ordinances of His house and the glories of His kingdom, and teach the people the way of salvation; for there are certain ordinances and principles that, when they are taught and practiced, must be done in a place or house built for that purpose. (<i>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith,<\/i> 307\u20138)  <\/blockquote>  <p>  Anytime we see prophecy fulfilled, our testimonies are strengthened. The faithful in the nations of the world are gathering to temples all over the world, and we are witnesses of it! The millennial day sounds wonderful, but we've got to get our act together before it arrives. Isaiah warns us, as have modern prophets, against pride, materialism, and all forms of idolatry. The great and terrible day of the Lord will be either great or terrible for us, depending on how we respond to the prophets, including these words of Isaiah.  <\/p>  ",
