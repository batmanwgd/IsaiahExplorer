    "html": "<p>&ldquo;One of the most evil and wicked sects supported by Satan is that which practices<em>witchcraft,<\/em> such craft involving as it does actual intercourse with evil spirits. A<em>witch<\/em> is one who engages in this craft, who practices the black art of magic, who has entered into a compact with Satan, who is a sorcerer or sorceress. Modernly the term witch has been limited in application to women.<\/p><p>&ldquo;There are no witches, of course, in the sense of old hags flying on broomsticks through October skies; such mythology is a modernistic spoofing of a little understood practice that prevailed in all the apostate kingdoms of the past and which even now is found among many peoples.&rdquo; (Bruce R.
