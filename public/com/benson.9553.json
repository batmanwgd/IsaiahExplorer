It is not sufficient that the nations only, with their wealth and possessions, shall be added to the church, and perform all requisite offices toward it, but<i>kings<\/i> and<i>princes<\/i> also shall come: nor shall they come alone; a great retinue shall attend them: nor shall instances of their approach be few and rare, but common and frequent; insomuch that the gates of the city shall be always left open to receive this continual accession of kings and people.\u201d<i>The nation, &c., that will not serve thee<\/i>\u2014Do offices of kindness to thee, as the word<span class=\"hebrew_text\"> \u05d5\u05e2\u05d1\u05d3\u05d5<\/span> is used <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MDI4XQ==\">Isaiah 19:23<\/a> , or, that will not submit to Christ\u2019s sceptre;<i>shall perish<\/i>\u2014Shall not only be subdued to thee, but shall be destroyed by the sword, or famine, or pestilence, or some other of the divine judgments. <i>Yea, those nations shall be utterly wasted<\/i>\u2014Shall, by the peculiar interposition of a righteous providence, be brought to desolation. \u201cThis,\u201d says Lowth, \u201cmust relate to<i>the latter days,<\/i> as the Scripture calls them, when the church shall become<i>a great mountain, and break in pieces all the kingdoms of the earth,<\/i> according to Daniel\u2019s prophecy, <a class=\"ref\">Daniel 2:35; Daniel 2:44<\/a>.\u201d<\/p> ",
