What great things God would do for his church and people, which should now shortly be accomplished in the deliverance of Jerusalem from Sennacherib and the destruction of the Assyrian army but it is expressed generally, for the encouragement of the church in after ages, with reference to the power and prevalency of her enemies. 1. That proud oppressors should be reckoned with, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTUzXQ==\">Isaiah 27:1<\/a>. 2. That care should be taken of the church, as of God's vineyard, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTU0XQ==\">Isaiah 27:2<\/a>. 3. That God would let fall his controversy with the people, upon their return to him, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTU2XQ==\">Isaiah 27:4<\/a>. 4. That he would greatly multiply and increase them, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTU4XQ==\">Isaiah 27:6<\/a>. 5. That, as to their afflictions, the property of them should be altered ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTU5XQ==\">Isaiah 27:7<\/a>), they should be mitigated and moderated ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTYwXQ==\">Isaiah 27:8<\/a>), and sanctified, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTYxXQ==\">Isaiah 27:9<\/a>. 6. That though the church might be laid waste, and made desolate, for a time ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTYyXQ==\">Isaiah 27:10<\/a>), yet it should be restored, and the scattered members should be gathered together again, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTY0XQ==\">Isaiah 27:12<\/a>. All this is applicable to the grace of the gospel, and God's promises to, and providences concerning, the Christian church, and such as belong to it.<\/p> ",
