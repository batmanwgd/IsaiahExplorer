    "html": "<p> Thus does the wrath of God prevail among men, casting down and destroying; and the natural world above and below cannot fail to take part in it. <em> \u201cTherefore I shake the heavens, and the earth trembles away from its place, because of the wrath of Jehovah of hosts, and because of the day of His fierce anger.\u201d<\/em> The two <em> Beths<\/em> have a causative meaning (cf., <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODQ4XQ==\">Isaiah 9:18<\/a>). They correspond to <em> \u201bal<\/em> -<em> ce\u0304n <\/em> (therefore), of which they supply the explanation. Because the wrath of God falls upon men, every creature which is not the direct object of the judgment must become a medium in the infliction of it. We have here the thought of  repeated as a kind of refrain (in a similar manner to <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzY1XQ==\">Isaiah 5:25<\/a>). Then follow the several disasters. The first is flight.<\/p>",
