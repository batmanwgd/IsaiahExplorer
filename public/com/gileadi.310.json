In a time when his holy Spirit prevails throughout the earth (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4Mjc1LDE4NTM3LDE4ODIyXQ==\">Isaiah 32:15; 44:3; 59:21<\/a>), when every system besides Jehovah&rsquo;s has been tried and found wanting, those who don&rsquo;t serve Jehovah must perish (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODM0XQ==\">Isaiah 60:12<\/a>). Because briars and thorns&mdash;the world&rsquo;s wicked&mdash;have no place in his kingdom, they will burn up as in his Day of Judgment. Alternatively, they may make peace with Jehovah and find refuge in him the same as his elect people have done (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3OTAzLDE4MTIzXQ==\">Isaiah 12:2; 25:4<\/a>).<\/p>",
