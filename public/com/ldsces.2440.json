    "html": "<p>Those in any age who transgress God&rsquo;s commands are separated from His Spirit. In their separated condition, they neither hear nor understand the word of the Lord, as Elder Mark E. Petersen explained:<\/p><p>&ldquo;The true Church must always produce new scripture. &hellip; If it does not, we must admit that it has drifted from the path of truth and right. It was Isaiah who explained such a situation which existed anciently when he said:<\/p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&hellip; the Lord&rsquo;s hand is not shortened, that it cannot save; neither his ear heavy, that it cannot hear:<\/p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;For your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and you sins have hid his face from you, &hellip;&rsquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg4MDIiOjJ9XQ==\">Isa. 59:1&ndash;2<\/a>.)<\/p><p>&ldquo;To say that there can be no new scripture is itself unscriptural and contrary to the teachings of the Bible. If we truly believe the Bible, we must expect additional scripture from time to time, and to do so we must look for living prophets to receive the revelations which are to become that new scripture. We cannot escape this conclusion. It is a well-established pattern of God&rsquo;s hand-dealings with men all down through the ages.&rdquo; (In Conference Report, Oct. 1964, p. 122.)<\/p><p class=\"cite\">LDS Church Educational System Old Testament Student Manual, 1 Kings&ndash;Malachi, Religion 302, Chapter 18, Item 12<\/p>",
