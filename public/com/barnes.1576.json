    "html": " <p> <em>He shall not cry <\/em>&mdash;He will not make a clamor or noise; he will not be boisterous, in the manner of a man of strife and contention. <\/p> <p> <em>Nor lift up <\/em>&mdash;That is, his voice. <\/p> <p> <em>Nor cause his voice to be heard in the street <\/em>&mdash;He shall not t use loud and angry words, as they do who are engaged in conflict, but all his teaching shall be gentle, humble, and mild. How well this agrees with the character of the Lord Jesus it is not necessary to pause to show. He was uniformly unostentatious, modest, and retiring. He did not even desire that his deeds should be blazoned abroad, but sought to be withdrawn from the world, and to pursue his humble path in perfect peace. <\/p> ",
