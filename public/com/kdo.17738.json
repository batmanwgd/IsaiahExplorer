    "html": "<p><em> \u201cAnd the glory of his forest and his garden-ground will He destroy, even to soul and flesh, so that it is as when a sick man dieth. And the remnant of the trees of his forest can be numbered, and a boy could write them.\u201d<\/em> The army of Asshur, composed as it was of many and various nations, was a forest (<em> ya\u201bar <\/em> ); and, boasting as it did of the beauty of both men and armour, a garden ground (<em> carmel<\/em> ), a human forest and park. Hence the idea of \u201cutterly\u201d is expressed in the proverbial \u201ceven to soul and flesh,\u201d which furnishes the occasion for a leap to the figure of the wasting away of a \u05e0\u05e1\u05e1 (<em> hap<\/em> . <em> leg<\/em> . the consumptive man, from <em> na\u0302sas <\/em> , related to <em> nu\u0304sh <\/em> , <em> ' a\u0302nash <\/em> , Syr. <em> n\u201bs\u0131\u0304so <\/em> , <em> n\u201bshisho <\/em> , a sick man, based upon the radical notion of melting away, cf., <em> m a\u0302sas <\/em> , or of reeling to and fro, cf., <em> mu\u0304t <\/em> , <em> nu\u0304t <\/em> , Arab. <em> na\u0302sa <\/em> , <em> na\u0302ta <\/em> ). Only a single vital spark would still glimmer in the gigantic and splendid colossus, and with this its life would threaten to become entirely extinct. Or, what is the same thing, only a few trees of the forest, such as could be easily numbered (<em> m ispa\u0302r <\/em> as in <a class=\"ref\">Deuteronomy 33:6<\/a>, cf., <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MDUzXQ==\">Isaiah 21:17<\/a>), would still remain, yea, so few, that a boy would be able to count and enter them. And this really came to pass. Only a small remnant of the army that marched against Jerusalem ever escaped. With this small remnant of an all-destroying power the prophet now contrasts the remnant of Israel, which is the seed of a new power that is about to arise.<\/p>",
