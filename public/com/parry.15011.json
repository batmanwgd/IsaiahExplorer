It may be also that the Egyptians are fearful of Judah because of Jehovah's powerful demonstration in days of old when he battled against Ramses, an Egyptian Pharaoh, and sent plagues of various kinds upon the Egyptians. In this prophecy Jehovah again makes plans against Egypt (\"the counsel of the Lord&hellip;which he hath determined against\" Egypt), causing its inhabitants to fear.<\/p> ",
