    "html": "<p>             (9) Hell from beneath is moved for thee . . .\u2014\u201cHell,\u201d or Sheol, is, as elsewhere, the shadow-world, the region of the dead. Into that world the king of Babylon descends. The \u201cdead\u201d and the Rephaim are there, the giant-spectres, now faint and feeble (<a class=\"ref\">Deuteronomy 2:11; Deuteronomy 3:11<\/a>), of departed forms of greatness. The verb (\u201cit stirreth up\u201d), which is masculine, while the noun is feminine, seems to personify Sheol, as Hades is personified in <a class=\"ref\">Revelation 20:14<\/a>. The \u201cchief ones\u201d are, literally, the he-goats, or \u201cbell-wethers\u201d of the flock (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MzEwLDIzMDIwXQ==\">Isaiah 34:6; Zechariah 10:3<\/a>), of which Hades is the shepherd (<a class=\"ref\">Psalms 49:14<\/a>). Even in Sheol the kings of the earth retain their former majesty, and sit on thrones apart from the vulgar dead. In <a class=\"ref\">Ezekiel 32:17-32<\/a> we have a reproduction of the same imagery, and the kings appear, each with his \u201cweapons of war.\u201d The whole passage finds a striking parallel in the Assyrian legend of the Descent of Ishtar (Records of the Past, i. p. 144), where Hades is described.<\/p>\n <p>\u201cThe abode of darkness and famine.<\/p>\n <p>* * * * * *<\/p>\n <p>Night is not seen\u2014in darkness they dwell.<\/p>\n <p>Ghosts, like birds, flutter their wings there.<\/p>\n <p>On the door and gate-posts the dust lies undisturbed.<\/p>\n <p>* * * * * * *<\/p>\n <p>To be the ruler of a palace shall be thy rank;<\/p>\n <p>A throne of state shall be thy seat.\u201d<\/p>",
