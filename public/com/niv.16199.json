However, if that were the case, the material has been placed here in a much larger theological context. The fact that Assyria is not named is indicative of this. All the destructive and deceptive character of earth\u2019s nations is used as a foil to depict the radically different character of the biblical God and of the kingdom he will build.<\/p>     <p>\u2003In 33:2 we see the outcome that has been desired throughout this section. Speaking for the people, the prophet says that they will wait (NIV \u201clong\u201d) for the Lord (cf. 30:18). Perhaps the Israelites have been forced to because the promised Egyptian help has proven useless. Nevertheless, they are now no longer trusting the nations to deliver them from the nations. They have nowhere else to turn but to God, and Isaiah has no question about God\u2019s ability to deliver. When God speaks, \u201cnations\u201d and \u201cpeoples\u201d will \u201cscatter.\u201d All the \u201cplunder\u201d they have stolen from other nations will be stripped away from them as though by \u201clocusts.\u201d<\/p>     <p>\u2003This is so because the Lord is the only One who is truly \u201cexalted\u201d (33:5). All the attempts by humans to exalt themselves by force and deception will ultimately fail, because God alone sits \u201con high\u201d (cf. 14:4\u201321). He does not, however, use his position as a justification for oppression. Instead, his character will provide a \u201cfoundation\u201d on which people can live with confidence (cf. 28:16\u201317). That foundation is \u201cjustice\u201d and \u201crighteousness\u201d (33:5), and on it can be erected \u201csalvation,\u201d \u201cwisdom and knowledge.\u201d All of this is available to the person who acknowledges that God is the Lord and gives him reverent obedience: \u201cthe fear of the L<small>ORD<\/small>\u201d (33:6).<\/p>     ",
