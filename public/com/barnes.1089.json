Gesenius supposes that it is rather the language of compassion, on account of the evil which they threatened to bring upon the people of God, like<a class=\"ref\">1 Kings 13:30<\/a> , &lsquo;Ah! wo, my brother!&rsquo;<\/p><p><em>The multitude of many people<\/em> &mdash;Or, the tumult of many nations&mdash;a description of the noise attending an invading army made up of many nations mingled together, such as was that of Sennacherib.<\/p><p><em>Which make a noise...<\/em> &mdash;This is a beautiful description of a vast army, and of the shouting, the tumult, the din, which attends its march. The same comparison occurs in<a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 6:23; Psalm 65:7<\/a> (see<a class=\"ref\">Ezekiel 43:2; Revelation 1:15; Revelation 14:2; Revelation 19:6<\/a>).<\/p><p><em>And to the rushing of nations<\/em> &mdash;The rushing of mighty armies to conquest.<\/p> ",
