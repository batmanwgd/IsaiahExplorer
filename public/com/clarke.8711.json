Expositors give no very good account of this word in this place. In a MS. it was at first <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05dc\u05e2\u05d1\u05d3\u05d5 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">leabdo<\/span>, to his servant or work, which is probably the true reading. The sense however is pretty much the same with the common interpretation: \"Every one shall turn aside to his own business; none shall deliver thee.\"<\/p>",
