And this should coincide with the day of a \u201cgreat slaughter,\u201d perhaps of the enemies of Israel, perhaps also of the people themselves (judgment coming before the blessing), and of the fall of the \u201ctowers\u201d in which they had put their trust. (Comp. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDI1XQ==\">Isaiah 40:4<\/a>.) As before, man\u2019s extremity was to be God\u2019s opportunity.
