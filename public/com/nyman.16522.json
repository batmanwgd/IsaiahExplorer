    "html": "          <p>That unto me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear\" is another statement showing clearly that Jesus Christ is the Administrator of the Old Testament. Paul quoted this passage with reference to Christ in writing to the Romans and the Philippians:<\/p>     <table>         <tbody>             <tr>                 <td>I have sworn by myself, the word is gone out of my mouth in righteousness, and shall not return, That unto me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear. (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NTg1XQ==\">Isaiah 45:23<\/a>.) <\/td>                 <td>For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God. (<a class=\"ref\">Rom. 14:11<\/a>.) <\/td>                 <td>That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in earth, and things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth;                     <p>And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. (<a class=\"ref\">Philip. 2:10-11<\/a>.)<\/p>                 <\/td>             <\/tr>         <\/tbody>     <\/table>     <p>The prophet Abinedi gave an indication of the time when this prophecy will be fulfilled (see <a class=\"ref\">Mosiah 16:1-4<\/a>), and his text was used by President Joseph Fielding Smith to show that those who \"bow\" and \"confess\" are not celestial beings who will receive exaltation, but primarily telestial beings who will have to acknowledge the Savior and admit that his judgments are just (see DS, 2:30-31). The Doctrine and Covenants also uses similar language in reference to the telestial beings (see <a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 76:110<\/a>; compare 88:104).<\/p>     ",
