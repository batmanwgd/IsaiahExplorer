    "html": "<p> What the prophet here foretells to the daughter of Zion he sees in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzM0XQ==\">Isaiah 3:26<\/a> fulfilled upon her: <em> \u201cThen will her gates lament and mourn, and desolate is she, sits down upon the ground.\u201d<\/em> The gates, where the husbands of the daughters of Zion, who have now fallen in war, sued at one time to gather together in such numbers, are turned into a state of desolation, in which they may, as it were, be heard complaining, and seen to mourn (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3OTYwXQ==\">Isaiah 14:31<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 14:2; Lamentations 1:4<\/a>); and the daughter of Zion herself is utterly vacated, thoroughly emptied, completely deprived of all her former population; and in this state of the most mournful widowhood or orphanage, brought down from her lofty seat (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NjAxXQ==\">Isaiah 47:1<\/a>) and princely glory (<a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 13:18<\/a>), she sits down upon the ground, just as Judaea is represented as doing upon Roman medals that were struck after the destruction of Jerusalem, where she is introduced as a woman thoroughly broken down, and sitting under a palm-tree in an attitude of despair, with a warrior standing in front of her, the inscription upon the medal being <em> Judaea capta <\/em> , or <em> devicta <\/em> . The Septuagint rendering is quite in accordance with the sense, viz., \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9\u0300 \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03c6\u03b8\u03b7\u0313\u03c3\u03b7 \u03bc \u03bf\u0301\u03bd\u03b7 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9\u0300 \u03b5\u03b9\u0313\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd\u0300 \u03b3\u03b7\u0342\u03bd \u03b5\u0313\u03b4\u03b1\u03c6\u03b9\u03c3\u03b8\u03b7\u0301\u03c3\u03b7 (cf., <a class=\"ref\">Luke 19:44<\/a>), except that \u05ea\u05bc\u05e9\u05c1\u05d1 is not the second person, but the third, and \u05e0\u05e7\u05bc\u05ea\u05d4 the third pers. pret. <em> niph<\/em> . for \u05e0\u05e7\u05bc\u05ea\u05d4 - a pausal form which is frequently met with in connection with the smaller distinctive accents, such as <em> silluk<\/em> and <em> athnach<\/em> (here it occurs with <em> tiphchah<\/em> , as, for example, in <a class=\"ref\">Amos 3:8<\/a>). The clause \u201csits down upon the ground\u201d is appended \u03b1\u0313\u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03b4\u03b5\u0313\u0301\u03c4\u03c9\u03c2 - a frequent construction in cases where one of two verbs defines the other in a manner which is generally expressed adverbially (vid., <a class=\"ref\">1 Chronicles 13:2<\/a>, and the inverted order of the words in <a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 4:5<\/a>; cf., <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3OTA3XQ==\">Isaiah 12:6<\/a>): Zion sits upon the earth in a state of utter depopulation.<\/p>",
