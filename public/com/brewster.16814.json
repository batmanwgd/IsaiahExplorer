Isaiah appears to show his disdain for King Pekah by not mentioning his name, referring to him as \"the son of Remaliah.\" That Pekah deserved this scorn is evident by this description of him: \"And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord: he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam \u2026 , who made Israel to sin.\" (<a class=\"ref\">2 Kings 15:28<\/a>.)<\/p>",
