Once again (cf. 5:26), a signal \u201cbanner\u201d is run up to call the various nations to come against God\u2019s enemy in judgment (13:2; see 5:26). But these armies come from the very \u201cends of the heavens\u201d (13:5). This is not a merely historical judgment but an eschatological one. Furthermore, there is no question who is the effective cause of this uproar. It is \u201c<small>I<\/small>,\u201d \u201cthe L<small>ORD<\/small> Almighty,\u201d \u201cthe Almighty.\u201d Even the mightiest and most glorious of earth\u2019s nations is no match for the God who has placed his name on Jerusalem. Against him there will be no mighty blows, only limp hands and melted hearts (13:7). Nor will there be any arrogant looks, only the red faces of shame and disgrace (13:8).<\/p>         ",
