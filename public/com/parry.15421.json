In chapter 39, Isaiah converses briefly with King Hezekiah and utters a prophecy upon his head. The king responds, \"Good is the word of the Lord which thou hast spoken.\" Certainly our lives would be greatly blessed if the leaders of the nations of the world consulted often with the living prophet, and then, after receiving direction, responded with \"Good is the word of the Lord.\"<\/i><\/p> ",
