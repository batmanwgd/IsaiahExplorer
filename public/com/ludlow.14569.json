    "html": " <p>In this famous chapter of latter-day prophecy, Nephi quotes Isaiah&rsquo;s description of sacred records coming forth as a voice from &ldquo;out of the dust&rdquo; (2 Nephi 26:16) and provides insights into how these records will be received in latter days. These records signify the opening of a notable period in the world&rsquo;s history, when the gospel of Jesus Christ is brought forth and reinforced through various ancient religious writings.<\/p> <p>The following phrases from the Book of Mormon rendition of Isaiah 29 are often cited in Latter-day Saint literature and church meetings: &ldquo;a marvelous work and a wonder&rdquo; (27:26); &ldquo;speech [or records] .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. out of the dust&rdquo; (26:16); &ldquo;words of the book which were sealed&rdquo; (27:11); &ldquo;three witnesses .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. shall testify to the truth of the book&rdquo; (27:12); and &ldquo;people draw near unto me with their mouth, and with their lips .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. , but .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. their hearts [are] far from me&rdquo; (27:25). Obviously, key gospel doctrines and latter day prophecies come from Isaiah 29.<\/p> <p>The additional material provided by Nephi in 2 Nephi 26&ndash;27 makes the Book of Mormon rendition of Isaiah 29 significantly longer than the biblical text. While Isaiah 29 contains only twenty-four verses in the King James Version, Nephi&rsquo;s version contains fifty-four (2 Nephi 26:15&ndash;27:35). Two explanations may account for the difference:<\/p> <ul> <li>Isaiah&rsquo;s original record may have been longer than the King James Version is today. Multiple biblical copying and revisions (and even errors) may have resulted in missing portions of the Isaiah text. Nephi&rsquo;s version of the book of Isaiah, obtained from the brass plates of Laban, was therefore less edited and corrupted than our earliest available copies today, such as the Dead Sea Scrolls. Thus, the more ancient and complete version is recorded in Nephi&rsquo;s copy of Isaiah&rsquo;s words.<\/li> <li>Isaiah&rsquo;s record may not have been edited and tampered with substantially and was essentially the same size during Nephi&rsquo;s day as it is today. Nephi simply elaborated upon Isaiah&rsquo;s words by writing the additional thirty verses of inspired insight. Thus, the Book of Mormon rendition provides both the original prophetic text accompanied by the revealed commentary of another prophet.<\/li> <\/ul> <p>Either explanation may be correct, but some combination of the two probably provides an accurate representation of fact. Whichever set of facts best explains how the Isaiah text was expanded in the Book of Mormon, Nephi&rsquo;s adaptation of Isaiah 29 is highly pertinent to us today, describing events that have, or will shortly, come to pass. With Nephi&rsquo;s inspired comments, we actually see the prophecy through the perspective of two prophets&mdash;Isaiah and Nephi.<\/p> <p>For further insight, it is helpful to compare the three different versions of Isaiah&rsquo;s text as found in the King James Version of the Bible, the Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible, and the Book of Mormon, 2 Nephi 26&ndash;27:<\/p> <table cellpadding=\"2\"> <tbody> <tr class=\"Underline\"> <td valign=\"top\"><strong>Part<\/strong><\/td> <td valign=\"top\"><strong>KJV: Isaiah 29<\/strong><\/td> <td valign=\"top\"><strong>JST: Isaiah 29<\/strong><\/td> <td valign=\"top\"><strong>2 Nephi: Isa. 29<\/strong><\/td> <td valign=\"top\"><strong>Description of Contents<\/strong><\/td> <\/tr> <tr> <td valign=\"top\">1<\/td> <td valign=\"top\"><strong>29:1-2<\/strong><\/td> <td valign=\"top\"><strong>29:1-2<\/strong><\/td> <td valign=\"top\"><strong>&mdash;<\/strong><\/td> <td valign=\"top\"><strong>Isaiah's introduction<\/strong><\/td> <\/tr> <tr> <td valign=\"top\">2<\/td> <td valign=\"top\"><strong>&mdash;<\/strong><\/td> <td valign=\"top\"><strong>&mdash;<\/strong><\/td> <td valign=\"top\">26:14-15a<\/td> <td valign=\"top\"><em>Nephi's first introduction<\/em><\/td> <\/tr> <tr> <td valign=\"top\">3<\/td> <td valign=\"top\"><strong>29:3-4 <\/strong><\/td> <td valign=\"top\"><strong>29:3-4<\/strong><\/td> <td valign=\"top\"><strong>26:15b-16<\/strong><\/td> <td valign=\"top\"><strong>Warfare and \"speech out of the dust\" <\/strong><\/td> <\/tr> <tr> <td valign=\"top\">4<\/td> <td valign=\"top\"><strong>&mdash;<\/strong><\/td> <td valign=\"top\"><strong>&mdash;<\/strong><\/td> <td valign=\"top\">26:17<\/td> <td valign=\"top\"><em>Sealed records hidden from unbelievers<\/em><\/td> <\/tr> <tr> <td valign=\"top\">5<\/td> <td valign=\"top\"><strong>29:5<\/strong><\/td> <td valign=\"top\"><strong>29:5<\/strong><\/td> <td valign=\"top\"><strong>26:18<\/strong><\/td> <td valign=\"top\"><strong>Multitudes disappear as chaff<\/strong><\/td> <\/tr> <tr> <td valign=\"top\">6<\/td> <td valign=\"top\"><strong>&mdash;<\/strong><\/td> <td valign=\"top\"><strong>&mdash;<\/strong><\/td> <td valign=\"top\">26:19-33<\/td> <td valign=\"top\"><em>Nephi's commentary;

It appears that the JST text provides a more complete version of the original Isaiah text. If the JST is not a full restoration of the ancient Isaiah text, it is at least the Isaiah text with Nephi&rsquo;s inspired interpretation as included by the Prophet Joseph Smith in the manuscript of his &ldquo;Inspired Version.&rdquo; Therefore, this JST version is highlighted in bold print on the chart. We will now review the Isaiah text as found in 2 Nephi 26&ndash;27. To help track where the Isaiah passages are in 2 Nephi, we will refer to the sixteen parts (or segments) of the chart.<\/p> ",
