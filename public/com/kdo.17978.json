    "html": "<p> Rabshakeh, who is mentioned alone in both texts as the leading person engaged, returns to Sennacherib, who is induced to make a second attempt to obtain possession of Jerusalem, as a position of great strength and decisive importance. <em> \u201cRabshakeh thereupon returned, and found the king of Asshur warring against Libnah: for he had heard that he had withdrawn from Lachish. And he heard say concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, <\/em> (K.<em> Behold<\/em> )<em> , he has come out to make war with thee; and heard, and sent <\/em> (K.<em> and repeated, and sent<\/em> )<em> messengers to Hizkiyahu, saying.\u201d<\/em> Tirhakah was cursorily referred to in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzk5OSI6N30=\">Isaiah 18:1-7<\/a>. The twenty-fifth dynasty of Manetho contained three Ethiopian rulers: <em> Sabakon <\/em> , <em> Sebicho\u0304s <\/em> ( \u05e1\u05d5\u05d0 = \u05e1\u05d5\u05d0 ), although, so far as we know, the Egyptian names begin with <em> Sh <\/em> ), and <em> Tarakos <\/em> (<em> Tarkos <\/em> ), Egypt. <em> Taharka <\/em> , or Heb. with the tone upon the penultimate, <em> Tirha\u0302qa\u0302h <\/em> . The only one mentioned by Herodotus is Sabakon, to whom he attributes a reign of fifty years (ii. 139), i.e., as much as the whole three amount to, when taken in a round sum. If Sebichos is the biblical <em> So' <\/em> , to whom the lists attribute from twelve to fourteen years, it is perfectly conceivable that Tirhakah may have been reigning in the fourteenth year of Hezekiah. But if this took place, as Manetho affirms, 366 years before the conquest of Egypt by Alexander, i.e., from 696 onwards (and the <em> Apis-stele<\/em> , No. 2037, as deciphered by Vic. de Roug\u00e9, <em> Revue arch\u00e9ol.<\/em> 1863, confirms it), it would be more easily reconcilable with the Assyrian chronology, which represents Sennacherib as reigning from 702-680 (Oppert and Rawlinson), than with the current biblical chronology, according to which Hezekiah's fourteenth year is certainly not much later than the year 714.<\/p><p> (Note: On the still prevailing uncertainty with regard to the synchronism, see Keil on Kings; and Duncker, <em> Geschichte des Alterthums<\/em> . pp. 713-4.)<\/p><p> It is worthy of remark also, that Tirhakah is not described as Pharaoh here, but as the king of Ethiopia (<em> m elekh <\/em> <em> Ku\u0304sh <\/em> ; see at <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4Mzg5XQ==\">Isaiah 37:36<\/a>). Libnah, according to the Onom. a place <em> in regione Eleutheropolitana <\/em> , is probably the same as <em> Tell es-Safieh<\/em> (\u201chill of the pure\u201d = of the white), to the north-west of <em> Bet Gibrin<\/em> , called <em> Alba Specula<\/em> (<em> Blanche Garde<\/em> ) in ten middle ages. The expression \u05d5\u05d9\u05bc\u05e9\u05c1\u05de\u05e2 (\u201cand he heard\u201d), which occurs twice in the text, points back to what is past, and also prepares the way for what follows: \u201chaving heard this, he sent,\u201d etc. At the same time it appears to have been altered from \u05d5\u05d9\u05bc\u05e9\u05c1\u05d1 .<\/p>",
