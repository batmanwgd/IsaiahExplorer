    "html": "<p>The Lord does not work alone. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODg0NyI6OX0=\">Isaiah 61:3&ndash;11<\/a> refers to the physical restoration of Zion and to the priesthood, which Zion&rsquo;s sons will use to restore again this glory of the Lord. Once again the marriage figure is employed to depict the covenant between the Lord and His people in the latter days. Covered &ldquo;with the robe of righteousness&rdquo; and dressed &ldquo;as a bride adorneth herself with pearls&rdquo; ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODU0XQ==\">v. 10<\/a>), Zion awaits the coming of her &ldquo;husband,&rdquo; Jesus Christ. John the Revelator used a similar figure when he spoke of &ldquo;the marriage of the Lamb [Jesus] and his wife [Zion]&rdquo; ( <a class=\"ref\">Revelation 19:7<\/a>). Here the bride is &ldquo;arrayed in fine linen,&rdquo; symbolic of &ldquo;the righteousness of saints&rdquo; ( <a class=\"ref\">Revelation 19:8<\/a>). Thus will be fulfilled that part of the tenth article of faith that states: &ldquo;Christ will reign personally upon the earth; and that the earth will be renewed and receive its paradisiacal glory.&rdquo; Verse 11 of <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 61<\/a> clearly describes that day when the Zion of the Lord, the New Jerusalem, will bring forth righteousness and praise &ldquo;as the garden causeth the things that are sown in it to spring forth.&rdquo;<\/p><p class=\"cite\"> LDS Church Educational System Old Testament Student Manual, 1 Kings&ndash;Malachi, Religion 302, Chapter 18, Item 19<\/p> ",
