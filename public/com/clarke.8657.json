And to show that the knowledge of future events belongs only to Jehovah, whom all creation is again called to adore for the deliverance and reconciliation granted to his people, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODU1NSI6M30=\">Isaiah 44:21-23<\/a> , the prophet concludes with setting in a very strong point of view the absolute impotence of every thing considered great and insurmountable in the sight of men, when standing in the way of the Divine counsel; and mentions the future deliverer of the Jewish nation expressly by name, nearly two hundred years before his birth, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODU1OCI6NX0=\">Isaiah 44:24-28<\/a>.<\/p> ",
