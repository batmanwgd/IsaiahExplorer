    "html": " <p>In this chapter, Isaiah warns the Israelites of dire consequences for their neglect of the poor and needy. As a result of their wickedness, the Lord will use the Assyrian army as a tool to remind Israel of her broken covenants with God. Isaiah also describes the pride of the Assyrian king, which will be the cause of his empire&rsquo;s eventual downfall. In the midst of prophesying judgment and destruction, Isaiah reveals that a remnant of the house of Israel will return. As is typical of Isaiah&rsquo;s writings, the events described in this chapter have both ancient historical and future prophetic fulfillment.<\/p> ",
