This verse is remarkably elegant, in which, what was the pleasure and confidence of those idolaters, is made to denote their punishment. \u201cAll the gardens in the East,\u201d says a late writer, \u201chave water in them, which is so absolutely necessary, that without it every thing, in summer, would be parched up. This is a circumstance which we should attend to, if we would enter into the energy of the latter clause.\u201d <\/p> ",
