Many of us are personally blessed to see the fulfillment of this prophecy as we enter the Lord's temples and are taught therein of \"his ways\" and walk in \"his paths\" (2:3). Isaiah's prophecy of the \"mountain of the Lord\" (2:1-5) is fulfilled as we build temples throughout the world.<\/i><\/p> <p><i> <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzY5NiI6MTN9\">Isa. 2:10-22<\/a> is one of the greatest prophecies recorded in the standard works of Christ's second coming and his judgments on the proud. Perhaps we, or our children or grandchildren, may witness these events as Jesus Christ comes again to the earth, this time with great power and glory.<\/i><\/p> ",
