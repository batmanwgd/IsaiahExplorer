The foreigners or Gentiles who &ldquo;hold fast&rdquo; to Jehovah&rsquo;s<em>covenant<\/em> , for example, are identical with those who &ldquo;hold fast&rdquo; to<em>righteousness<\/em> and<em>salvation<\/em> (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODc1NSI6Mn0=\">vv 1-2<\/a>)&mdash;the two<em>arms<\/em> of God (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4Njc5LDE4NjgzXQ==\">Isaiah 51:5, 9<\/a>)&mdash;uniting them in a common cause. These adhere to Jehovah and love his name in order to serve him and to be his &ldquo;servants&rdquo; or vassals. In its fullest sense, to &ldquo;serve&rdquo; Jehovah is thus to serve as proxy saviors to his people. As King Hezekiah offered prayer and sacrificed himself for Jehovah&rsquo;s people (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgzNjciOjd9LHsiMTgzOTIiOjZ9XQ==\">Isaiah 37:14-20; 38:1-6<\/a>), so do they.<\/p><p>Covenanting with Jehovah&mdash;including sanctifying the Sabbath (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzU2LDE4NzU4LDE4NzYwXQ==\">vv 2, 4, 6<\/a>)&mdash;thus unites his servants whatever their origins. Coordinating such historical types to determine their<em>composite<\/em> end-time counterparts, we may thus conclude that Jehovah&rsquo;s &ldquo;servants&rdquo; are identical with his &ldquo;servants&rdquo; or vassals who are his people&rsquo;s proxy saviors (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODg0LDE4OTA2XQ==\">Isaiah 63:17; 65:8<\/a>), with Zion&rsquo;s watchmen who herald Jehovah&rsquo;s coming (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODcwNV0seyIxODg2MSI6Mn1d\">Isaiah 52:8; 62:6-7<\/a>), with the kings and queens of the Gentiles who gather his sons and daughters (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODY1OSI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 49:22-23<\/a>), and with Egypt&rsquo;s covenanters who &ldquo;know Jehovah&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODAyMyI6NH0=\">Isaiah 19:18-21<\/a>).<\/p><p>The idea of &ldquo;loving&rdquo; or invoking Jehovah&rsquo;s &ldquo;name&rdquo; alludes to temple rites and ordinances through which those who covenant with him come to know Jehovah in person: &ldquo;In the very passage of your ordinances we anticipate you, O Jehovah; the soul&rsquo;s desire is to contemplate your name. My soul yearns for you in the night; at daybreak my spirit within me seeks after you. For when your ordinances are on the earth, the inhabitants of the world learn righteousness&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODEzOSI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 26:8-9<\/a>); &ldquo;Therefore shall my people come to know my name; in that day [they shall know] that I, who speak, am here&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzAzXQ==\">Isaiah 52:6<\/a>).<\/p> ",
