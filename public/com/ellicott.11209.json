    "html": "<p> (16) Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation . . .\u2014We have first to deal with the imagery, then with the interpretation. The former connects itself with the importance which attached, in ancient as in modern architecture, to the foundation stone of a building ( <a class=\"ref\">1 Kings 5:17<\/a>). So in Zion the foundation stone was laid, as witnessed in the Arabic name of the Mosque of Omar (Kubhet-es-Sakhra),(i.e., \u201cdome of the rock\u201d), on the solid rock. In the stone which was made \u201cthe head of the corner\u201d ( <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 118:22<\/a>) we have a like thought. From the prophet\u2019s stand-point this was identical with the manifestation of Jehovah\u2019s righteousness in and through the Temple in its higher spiritual aspect. Christian interpreters have rightly found the true fulfilment of the words in the person of the Christ ( <a class=\"ref\">Ephesians 2:20; 1 Peter 2:6-7<\/a>). The \u201ccorner stone,\u201d the lapis angularis of the Vulg. is that upon which two walls at right angles to each other rest and are bonded together. The \u201ctried stone\u201d (literally, stone of proof) may be one (1) which stands every test, or (2) one which tries those who come in contact with it, becoming an asylum, or a \u201cstone of stumbling,\u201d according to their character. (Comp. <a class=\"ref\">Luke 2:34-35; Luke 20:18<\/a>.)<\/p> \n<p>He that believeth shall not make haste.\u2014The LXX. and some other versions give \u201cshall not be ashamed,\u201d which is a paraphrase rather than a translation. The English Version, following the Vulgate, represents the meaning of the Hebrew, haste and hurry being regarded in their contrast to the calm temper of a steadfast faith. (Comp. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzU5XQ==\">Isaiah 5:19<\/a>.)<\/p> ",
