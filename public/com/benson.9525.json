By <i>labours <\/i>may be meant money gotten by labour, and lent to others, either for their need or the lender\u2019s advantage. For labour is often put for the fruit of labour, as <a class=\"ref\">Deuteronomy 28:33<\/a>; <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NTc2XQ==\">Isaiah 45:14<\/a>. But the Hebrew here,  <span class=\"hebrew_text\">\u05e2\u05e6\u05d1\u05d9\u05db\u05dd<\/span>, is literally, <i>your griefs, <\/i>namely, the things which cause <i>griefs, <\/i>which are grievous and burdensome to others, as either, 1st, Hard service required of servants above their strength, or beyond the time limited by God for their service, of which see <a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 34:13-16<\/a> : or, 2d, Debts, which they required, either with usury or with rigour and cruelty, when the general law of charity, or God\u2019s particular law, enjoined the release, or, at least, the forbearance of them. See <a class=\"ref\">Nehemiah 5:1-2<\/a>.<\/p>",
