    "html": "<p><em>Chariots of men \"The Syriac\"\u2014<\/em>It is not easy to say what <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d0\u05d3\u05dd \u05e8\u05db\u05d1 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">recheb adam<\/span>, a chariot of men, can mean. It seems by the form of the sentence, which consists of three members, the first and the third mentioning a particular people, that the second should do so likewise. Thus <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d5\u05e4\u05e8\u05e9\u05d9\u05dd \u05d0\u05e8\u05dd \u05d1\u05e8\u05db\u05d1 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">berecheb aram uparashim<\/span>, \"with chariots the Syrian, and with horsemen:\" the similitude of the letters <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d3 <\/span>  <span class=\"translit\">daleth<\/span>  and <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05e8 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">resh<\/span>  is so great, and the mistakes arising from it are so frequent, that I readily adopt the correction of Houbigant, <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d0\u05e8\u05dd <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">aram<\/span>, Syria, instead of <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d0\u05d3\u05dd <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">adam<\/span>, man; which seems to me extremely probable. The conjunction <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d5 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">vau<\/span>, and, prefixed to <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05e4\u05e8\u05e9\u05d9\u05dd <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">parashim<\/span>, horsemen, seems necessary in whatever way the sentence may be taken; and it is confirmed by five MSS., (one ancient), four of De Rossi's, and two ancient of my own; one by correction of Dr. Kennicott's, and three editions. Kir was a city belonging to the Medes. The Medes were subject to the Assyrians in Hezekiah's time, (see  <a class=\"ref\">2 Kings 16:9<\/a>, and  <a class=\"ref\">2 Kings 17:6<\/a>;); and so perhaps might Elam (the Persians) likewise be, or auxiliaries to them.<\/p>",
