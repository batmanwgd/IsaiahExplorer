According to the parable of the vineyard (see <a class=\"ref\">Jacob 5<\/a>), scattered branches will be grafted into the original tree and its stump will produce good (edible) fruit. The potential to produce life (\"substance\") remains in the old tree. Teil tree, as used in this context, is \"a rare English word for lime or linden tree. \u2026 Elsewhere the Heb[rew] word used is incorrectly translated [as] oak.\" (LDSBD, p. 780.)<\/p>",
