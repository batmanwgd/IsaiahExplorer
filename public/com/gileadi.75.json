Although what Jehovah does for them lacks nothing, they fall far short of his rightful expectations. They may indeed be bringing forth fruit, even much fruit, but none of it any good: &ldquo;Their watchmen are altogether blind and unaware&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 56:10<\/a>); &ldquo;Their works are worthless&rdquo; and &ldquo;amount to nothing&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 41:24, 29<\/a>). Sinking into apostasy, they &ldquo;have not wrought salvation in the earth&rdquo; in order that its inhabitants &ldquo;might not abort&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 26:18<\/a>).<\/p>",
