We know nothing certain concerning him, further than that he was the<i> treasurer,<\/i> or steward of the king\u2019s household. He seems to have been a different person from that<i> Shebna, the scribe,<\/i> mentioned<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MzU1XQ==\">Isaiah 37:2<\/a> . Some have thought that he was not a native Jew, but a foreigner, and a man of low birth; which they infer from \u201cthe pride of his desire to ennoble himself by a splendid sepulchre:\u201d but of these things there is no evidence.<\/p> ",
