The party lifestyle of the world, which so often depends on alcohol, will cease to exist; instead of the sounds of laughter, groans of discontent will prevail. The dependency on artificial stimulants for happiness indicates the pitiful state of the earth's inhabitants.<\/p> <p><i>timbrel\/harp. <\/i>Instruments that accompany the sounds of merriment and revelry have also stopped their joyous sounds. Babylon is to be thrown down, \"and the voice of harpers, and musicians, and of pipers, and trumpeters, shall be heard no more at all\" (<a class=\"ref\">Rev. 18:22<\/a>). Apparently, earth's inhabitants can no longer find joy or entertainment in their music.<\/p> ",
