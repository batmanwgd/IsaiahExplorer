This chapter concerns, I. The city of Jerusalem itself and the neighbourhood depending upon it. Here is, 1. A prophecy of the grievous distress they should shortly be brought into by Sennacherib's invasion of the country and laying siege to the city, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODA1NCI6N30=\">Isaiah 22:1-7 <\/a>. 2. A reproof given them for their misconduct in that distress, in two things:&mdash; (1.) Not having an eye to God in the use of the means of their preservation, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODA2MSI6NH0=\">Isaiah 22:8-11 <\/a>. (2.) Not humbling themselves under his mighty hand, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODA2NSI6M30=\">Isaiah 22:12-14 <\/a>. II. The court of Hezekiah, and the officers of that court. 1. The displacing of Shebna, a bad man, and turning him out of the treasury, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODA2OCI6NX0=\">Isaiah 22:15-19 <\/a>. 2. The preferring of Eliakim, who should do his country better service, to his place, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODA3MyI6NX0=\">Isaiah 22:20-24 <\/a>. <\/p> ",
