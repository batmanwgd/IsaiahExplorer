The fire of God\u2019s wrath shall destroy them, great and small.\u201d <i>And of his fruitful field <\/i>\u2014 Of his soldiers, who stand as thick as ears of corn do in a fruitful field. Hebrew, <i>Of his Carmel; <\/i>an allusion possibly to the vain threat, which God foreknew the Assyrian would hereafter utter, with regard to Israel, <i>I will enter into the height of his border, and the forest of his Carmel, <\/i><a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 37:24<\/a>. <i>Both soul and body \u2014 <\/i>Hebrew,  <span class=\"hebrew_text\">\u05de\u05e0\u05e4\u05e9\u05c1 \u05d5\u05e2\u05d3 \u05d1\u05e9\u05c2\u05e8<\/span>, <i>from the soul, <\/i><i>even to the flesh, <\/i>a proverbial expression. The fire of God\u2019s wrath shall consume them entirely and altogether. <i>And they shall be <\/i>\u2014 The state of the king, and of his vast and valiant army, shall be <i>as when a standard- bearer fainteth <\/i>\u2014 Like that of an army, when either the standard-bearer is slain, or rather flees away, which strikes a terror into the whole army, and puts them to flight. Bishop Lowth, in this clause, follows the reading of the LXX.,  <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u03c9\u03c2 \u03bf \u03c6\u03b5\u03c5\u03b3\u03c9\u03bd \u03b1\u03c0\u03bf \u03c6\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2<\/span>, It shall be, as when one fleeth out of raging flames: that is, \u201cThe few that escape shall be looked upon as having escaped from the most imminent danger.\u201d <i>The rest of the trees of his forest <\/i>\u2014 The remainders of that mighty host; <i>a child may write them <\/i>\u2014 A child, or the meanest accountant, may number and register them. It is justly observed by Dr. Dodd, that \u201cthe emphasis of this passage consists in the elegance of the metaphors.\u201d The first, taken from <i>leanness, <\/i>destroying the fat, and marring the beauty of the human form, well describes that terrible plague which destroyed the flower of the Assyrian host. The second, taken from fire, which, with unconquerable fury, in a short time reduces combustible matter to ashes, gives us a striking picture of the quick and almost instantaneous ruin brought on that army, by the irresistible power of the destroying angel, especially as that fire is represented as kindled by <i>the light of Israel. <\/i>And the third metaphor of the <i>thorns <\/i>and <i>briers, <\/i>which are so far from having any power to withstand the fury of the flames, that they provoke and feed it, affords us a lively emblem of the utter inability of the Assyrian monarch, or his mighty host, to make the least resistance against that divine vengeance which their crimes had merited. <\/p>",
