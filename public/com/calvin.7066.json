We are wont to stretch out our neck when we meet with anything that is strange, or that deserves our attention. Thus, when it was thought to be a kind of prodigy that this king, who possessed so great power, had died, the Prophet says that the eyes of all men were directed towards him, to look at him earnestly, as if they scarcely believed their own eyes. <\/p>,\n <p> <i>Is this the man that made the earth to tremble, that shook kingdoms? <\/i>,They first ask, if it be possible that he who, by the slightest expression of his will, <i>made the earth to tremble <\/i>,, should be so quickly and easily laid low.
