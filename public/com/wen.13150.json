Lift up thy voice\u2014To give notice to all people of these glad tidings; and by way of exultation, to sing forth the praises of God for this glorious day. Eye\u2014Distinctly and familiarly, their eyes beholding the eyes of this king of glory. They shall be eye and ear\u2014witnesses of the words and works of Christ, and therefore their testimony shall be more certain and valuable. Bring again\u2014When God shall complete the work of bringing his church out of captivity.",
