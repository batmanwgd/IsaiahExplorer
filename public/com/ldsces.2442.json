    "html": " <p> <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODgxNyI6Nn0=\">Isaiah 59:16&ndash;21<\/a> refers to Jesus Christ, our intercessor with the Father. He came to earth because &ldquo;there was no man&rdquo; and &ldquo;there was no intercessor&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODE3XQ==\">v. 16<\/a>) for the people. If the Savior had not been sent, our state, because of iniquity, would have been grim indeed (see <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODgwMiI6MTV9\">vv. 1&ndash;15<\/a>; compare <a class=\"ref\">2 Nephi 9:8&ndash;9<\/a>). Therefore, Jesus was sent to earth. &ldquo;His arm brought [man&rsquo;s] salvation unto him,&rdquo; which was possible because &ldquo;his righteousness, it sustained him,&rdquo; much as a breastplate protects a soldier in battle (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODE3XQ==\">v. 16<\/a>). On His head was a &ldquo;helmet of salvation,&rdquo; and He was clothed in &ldquo;garments of vengeance,&rdquo; for He deals with men &ldquo;according to their deeds&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODgxOCI6Mn0=\">vv. 17&ndash;18<\/a>). <\/p> <p>When the Savior comes again, He will &ldquo;come to Zion,&rdquo; and if Jacob, or the house of Israel, will &ldquo;turn from transgression&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODIxXQ==\">v. 20<\/a>) to the Lord, He will place His Spirit upon them. Elder Orson Pratt said of that promise: &ldquo;Certainly Jesus, when he came eighteen centuries ago, did not turn away ungodliness from Jacob, for they then were filling up their cup with iniquity. They have remained in unbelief from that day to this; hence, there did not come a Deliverer out of Zion eighteen centuries ago. But the Zion of the last days, that Zion that is so frequently and so fully spoken of by the ancient prophets, especially by Isaiah, is the Church and kingdom of God; and out of that Church or kingdom or Zion is to come a Deliverer, who will turn away ungodliness from Jacob after the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.&rdquo; (In <em>Journal of Discourses, <\/em> 14:64.) <\/p> <p class=\"cite\"> LDS Church Educational System Old Testament Student Manual, 1 Kings&ndash;Malachi, Religion 302, Chapter 18, Item 14 <\/p> ",
