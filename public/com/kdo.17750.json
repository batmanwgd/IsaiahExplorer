    "html": "<p> The fruit of righteousness is peace, which now reigns in humanity under the rule of the Prince of Peace, and even in the animal world, with nothing whatever to disturb it. <em> \u201cAnd the wolf dwells with the lamb, and the leopard lies down with the kid; and calf and lion and stalled ox together: a little boy drives them. And cow and bear go to the pasture; their young ones lie down together: and the lion eats shopped straw like the ox. And the suckling plays by the hole of the adder, and the weaned child stretches its hand to the pupil of the basilisk-viper. They will not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain: for the land is filled with knowledge of Jehovah, like the waters covering the sea.\u201d<\/em> The fathers, and such commentators as Luther, Calvin, and Vitringa, have taken all these figures from the animal world as symbolical. Modern rationalists, on the other hand, understand them literally, but regard the whole as a beautiful dream and wish. It is a prophecy, however, the realization of which is to be expected on this side of the boundary between time and eternity, and, as Paul has shown in Rom 8, is an integral link in the predestined course of the history of salvation (Hengstenberg, Umbreit, Hofmann, Drechsler). There now reign among irrational creatures, from the greatest to the least, - even among such as are invisible, - fierce conflicts and bloodthirstiness of the most savage kind. But when the Son of David enters upon the full possession of His royal inheritance, the peace of paradise will be renewed, and all that is true in the popular legends of the golden age be realized and confirmed. This is what the prophet depicts in such lovely colours. The wolf and lamb, those two hereditary foes, will be perfectly reconciled then. The leopard will let the teazing kid lie down beside it. The lion, between the calf and stalled ox, neither seizes upon its weaker neighbour, nor longs for the fatter one. Cow and bear graze together, whilst their young ones lie side beside in the pasture. The lion no longer thirsts for blood, but contents itself, like the ox, with chopped straw. The suckling pursues its sport (<em> pilpel<\/em> of \u05e9\u05c1\u05e2\u05e2 , <em> m ulcere <\/em> ) by the adder's hole, and the child just weaned stretches out its hand boldly and fearlessly to <em> me'u\u0304rath tziph\u201bo\u0304ni <\/em> . It is evident from <a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 8:17<\/a> that <em> tziph\u201bo\u0304ni <\/em> is the name of a species of snake. According to Aquila and the Vulgate, it is <em> basiliskos <\/em> , <em> serpens regulus <\/em> , possibly from <em> tzaph <\/em> , to pipe or hiss (Ges., F\u00fcrst); for Isidorus, in his Origg. xii. 4, says, <em> Sibilus idem est qui et regulus; sibilo enim occidit, antequam mordeat vel exurat <\/em> . For the <em> hapax leg<\/em> . <em> ha\u0302da\u0302h <\/em> , the meaning <em> dirigere <\/em> , <em> tendere <\/em> , is established by the Arabic; but there is all the more uncertainty about the meaning of the <em> hap. leg<\/em> . \u05de\u05d0\u05d5\u05e8\u05d4 . According to the parallel \u05d7\u05e8 , it seems to signify the hollow (Syr., Vulg., lxx, \u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u0301\u03c4\u03b7 ): whether from \u05d0\u05bc\u05d5\u05bc\u05e8 = \u05e2\u05d5\u05bc\u05e8 , from which comes \u05de\u05e2\u05e8\u05d4 ; or from \u05d0\u05d5\u05e8 , the light-hole (like \u05de\u05d0\u05d5\u05e8 , which occurs in the Mishna, <em> Ohaloth<\/em> xiii. 1) or opening where a cavern opens to the light of day. It is probable, however, that <em> m e'u\u0304ra\u0302h <\/em> refers to something that exerts an attractive influence upon the child, either the \u201cblending of colours\u201d (Saad. renders <em> tziph\u201boni <\/em> , <em> errakas' <\/em> , the motley snake), or better still, the \u201cpupil of the eye\u201d (Targum), taking the word as a feminine of <em> m a\u0302'o\u0304r <\/em> , the light of the eye (<em> b. Erubin<\/em> 55<em> b<\/em> - the power of vision). The look of a snake, more especially of the basilisk (not merely the basilisk-lizard, but also the basilisk-viper), was supposed to have a paralyzing and bewitching influence; but now the snake will lose this pernicious power (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4OTIzXQ==\">Isaiah 65:25<\/a>), and the basilisk become so tame and harmless, as to let children handle its sparkling eyes as if they were jewels. All this, as we should say with Luthardt and Hofmann (<em> Schriftbeweis<\/em> , ii. 2, 567), is only colouring which the hand of the prophet employs, for the purpose of painting the peace of that glorified state which surpasses all possibility of description; and it is unquestionably necessary to take the thought of the promise in a spiritual sense, without adhering literally to the medium employed in expressing it. But, on the other hand, we must guard against treating the description itself as merely a drapery thrown around the actual object; whereas it is rather the refraction of the object in the mind of the prophet himself, and therefore a manifestation of the true nature of that which he actually saw. <\/p><p> But are the animals to be taken as the subject in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODk0XQ==\">Isaiah 11:9<\/a> also? The subject that most naturally suggests itself is undoubtedly the animals, of which a few that are alarming and destructive to men have been mentioned just before. And the fact that they really are thought of as the subject, is confirmed by <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4OTIzXQ==\">Isaiah 65:25<\/a>, where  is repeated in a compendious form. The idea that \u05d9\u05e8\u05e2\u05d5\u05bc requires men as the subject, is refuted by the common \u05e8\u05e2\u05d4 \u05d7\u05d9\u05bc\u05d4 (compare the parallel promise in <a class=\"ref\">Ezekiel 34:25<\/a>, which rests upon <a class=\"ref\">Hosea 2:20<\/a>). That the term <em> yashchithu <\/em> can be applied to animals, is evident from <a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 2:30<\/a>, and may be assumed as a matter of course. But if the animals are the subject, <em> har kodshi <\/em> (my holy mountain) is not Zion-Moriah, upon which wild beasts never made their home in historical times; but, as the generalizing <em> col <\/em> (all) clearly shows, the whole of the holy mountain-land of Israel: <em> har kodshi <\/em> has just this meaning in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4Nzc5XQ==\">Isaiah 57:13<\/a> (cf., <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 78:54; Exodus 15:17<\/a>). The fact that peace prevails in the animal world, and also peace between man and beast, is then attributed to the universal prevalence of the knowledge of God, in consequence of which that destructive hostility between the animal world and man, by which estrangement and apostasy from God were so often punished (<a class=\"ref\">2 Kings 17:25; Ezekiel 14:15<\/a>, etc.: see also <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODA3XQ==\">Isaiah 7:24<\/a>), have entirely come to an end. The meaning of \u201cthe earth\u201d is also determined by that of \u201call my holy mountain.\u201d The <em> land of Israel<\/em> , the dominion of the Son of David in the more restricted sense, will be from this time forward the paradisaical centre, as it were, of the whole earth - a prelude of its future state of perfect and universal glorification (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzczXQ==\">Isaiah 6:3<\/a>, \u201call the earth\u201d). It has now become full of \u201cthe knowledge of Jehovah,\u201d i.e., of that experimental knowledge which consists in the fellowship of love ( \u05d3\u05e2\u05d4 , like \u05dc\u05d3\u05d4 , is a secondary form of \u05d3\u05e2\u05ea , the more common infinitive or verbal noun from \u05d9\u05d3\u05e2 : Ges. \u00a7133, 1), like the waters which cover the sea, i.e., bottom of the sea (compare <a class=\"ref\">Habakkuk 2:14<\/a>, where <em> la\u0302da\u201bath <\/em> is a virtual accusative, full of that which is to be known). \u201c<em> Cover<\/em> :\u201d <em> c issa\u0302h l' <\/em> (like <em> sa\u0302cac l' <\/em> , <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 91:4<\/a>), signifies to afford a covering to another; the <em> Lamed<\/em> is frequently introduced with a participle (in Arabic regularly) as a sign of the object (Ewald, \u00a7292,<em> e<\/em> ), and the omission of the article in the case of <em> mecassim <\/em> is a natural consequence of the inverted order of the words.<\/p>",
