This verse reminds us of a modern revelation in which Zion is called \"a land of peace, a city of refuge, a place of safety for the saints of the Most High God\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 45:66<\/a>). Elder Orson Pratt applied 32:17-19 to the Saints when they sought in the Rocky Mountains relief from persecution. <\/p> ",
