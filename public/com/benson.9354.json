The host of heaven, as it follows. <i>That bringeth out their host \u2014 <\/i>That at first brought them out of nothing, and from day to day brings them forth, making them to rise and set in their appointed times; <i>by number <\/i>\u2014 As a general brings forth his army into the field, and there musters them. <i>He calleth them all by names<\/i> \u2014 As a master calleth all the members of his family. <i>For that he is strong<\/i> \u2014 Which work is a certain and evident proof of God\u2019s infinite power; <i>not one faileth <\/i>\u2014 Either to appear when he calls them, or to do the work to which he sends them.<\/p>",
