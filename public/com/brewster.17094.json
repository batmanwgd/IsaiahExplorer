(<a class=\"ref\">Alma 40:13-14<\/a>.) Following His death on Calvary, the disembodied Christ went to the spirit world where He organized His righteous followers into a missionary task force to take the gospel to those in the spirit prison. (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 138:18-21, 28<\/a><b>.<\/b>) As these confined spirits accept the gospel, and as saving ordinances are performed in their behalf in holy temples here on earth, the prisoners are set free.<\/p>     <p>This great work caused the Prophet Joseph to exclaim, \"Let the dead speak forth anthems of eternal praise to the King Immanuel, who hath ordained, before the world was, that which would enable us to redeem them out of their prison; for the prisoners shall go free.\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 128:22<\/a>.)<\/p>",
