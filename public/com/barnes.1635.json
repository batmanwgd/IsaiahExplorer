    "html": "<p><em>Fear ye not, neither be afraid<\/em>&mdash;(see the notes at <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDYyXQ==\">Isaiah 41:10<\/a> ). The word rendered here &lsquo;be afraid,&rsquo; occurs nowhere else in the Bible. There can be no doubt, however, in regard to its meaning. The Septuagint renders it, &Mu;&eta;&delta;&epsilon;\u0301 &pi;&lambda;&alpha;&nu;&alpha;\u0342&sigma;&theta;&epsilon; Me\u0304de planasthe&mdash;&lsquo;Neither be deceived.&rsquo; All the other ancient versions express the sense to fear, to be afraid (Gesenius&rsquo; Lexicon on the word \u05d9\u05e8\u05d4 ya\u0302rahh).<\/p><p><em>Have not I told thee from that time<\/em>&mdash;Have I not fully declared from the very commencement of your history as a people, in the main what shall occur?<\/p><p><em>Ye are even my witnesses<\/em>&mdash;(See the notes at <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NTE4XQ==\">Isaiah 43:12<\/a>).<\/p><p><em>Is there a God besides me?<\/em>&mdash;This is a strong mode of affirming that there is no God besides Yahweh (see the note at <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NTQwXQ==\">Isaiah 44:6<\/a>).<\/p><p><em>Yea, there is no God<\/em>&mdash;Margin, &lsquo;Rock&rsquo; (\u05e6\u05d5\u05e8 tsu\u0302r). The word rock is often applied to God (see the note at <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MjQ3XQ==\">Isaiah 30:29<\/a> ; compare <a class=\"ref\">Deuteronomy 32:4, Deuteronomy 32:30-31; Psalm 19:14; Psalm 31:2-3; Psalm 42:9<\/a>; et soepe al. The idea is taken from the fact that a lofty rock or fastness was inaccessible by an enemy, and that those who fled there were safe.<\/p>",
