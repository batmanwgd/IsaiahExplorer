    "html": " <p>The cry of destruction of Moab is universal, even beyond her borders to Eglaim (En-Eglaim) northwest of the Salt Sea. To show the extent of the tragedy that Moab would experience, Isaiah prophesied that the heart of the rich pastoral land around Dibon would have its waters (called Dimon) stained with the blood of the people. In other words, there would be widespread slaughter and destruction of the people, the enemy penetrating even the very heart of Moab. <\/p> <p>In the Hebrew text, the word translated &ldquo;lion&rdquo; is actually a single lion. Isaiah revealed that the relationship of Judah and Moab would change, for the &ldquo;lion,&rdquo; Judah, would come upon the remnant of Moab that was spared and make them her vassal. <\/p> <p class=\"cite\"> LDS Church Educational System Old Testament Student Manual, 1 Kings&ndash;Malachi, Religion 302, Chapter 14, Item 20 <\/p> ",
