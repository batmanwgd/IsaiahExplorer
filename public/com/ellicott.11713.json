It is almost certain that the counsellors of the young Manasseh (probably the Shebna party), abandoning the religion of Israel in other things, would also disregard this. I take the prophet\u2019s teaching accordingly as directed against that evil. He utters his beatitude for those who are faithful to the r\u00e9gime of Hezekiah\u2019s reign, even though their alien birth or their condition as eunuchs seemed to exclude them from the polity of Israel (<a class=\"ref\">Deuteronomy 23:1-8 <\/a>). <\/p> ",
