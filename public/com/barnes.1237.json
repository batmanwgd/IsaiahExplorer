The word &lsquo;make mention&rsquo; (\u05e0\u05d6\u05db\u05d9\u05e8 nazekiyr) means literally to cause to be remembered; to commemorate; to celebrate. The idea is, that during their long captivity they had been subject to the dominion of other lords than Yahweh; but now that they were restored to their own land, they would acknowledge only Yahweh as their Lord, and would henceforward celebrate only his name.<\/p> ",
