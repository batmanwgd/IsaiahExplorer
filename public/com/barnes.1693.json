    "html": "<p><em>I bring near my righteousness<\/em>&mdash;The word &lsquo;righteousness&rsquo; here evidently denotes his truth; the fulfillment of his promises. His righteous and true character would be manifested to them so plainly and clearly that they would be able no longer to doubt. It would not be remote in time, or in place, but it would be so near that they could see it, and so plain that they could no longer doubt or misunderstand it.<\/p><p><em>And my salvation shall not tarry<\/em>&mdash;The people shall be delivered from their bondage at the exact time which has been predicted.<\/p><p><em>I will place salvation in Zion<\/em>&mdash;Zion or Jerusalem shall be rebuilt, and salvation shall emanate from that as from a center to the whole world.<\/p><p><em>Israel my glory<\/em>&mdash;The people whom he had chosen, and who reflected his glory. God&rsquo;s honor and glory on earth are seen in, and by the church, and he designs that the church shall be the means of making his glory known among people. Or it may mean I will give my glory to Israel. I will show to them my perfections, and will make their nation the place of the manifestations of my glorious attributes.<\/p>",
