    "html": "<p><i> Their slain shall be cast out.<\/i> By this circumstance he shews that it will be a great calamity, for if a few persons are \u201cslain,\u201d they are committed to the earth; but when so great a multitude is slain at one time, that there are not left as many as are necessary for burying them, there is no thought of interment, and therefore the air is polluted by<i> the stench of their carcases.<\/i> Hence it is evident, that God is sufficiently powerful to lay low innumerable armies. Perhaps, also, the Prophet intended to heighten the picture of the judgment of God, because to the slaughter of the nations there will be added shame and disgrace, so that they shall be deprived of the honor and duty of burial<\/p> \n<p><i> And the mountains shall melt on account of their blood.<\/i> Another figure of speech is employed to shew more fully the extent of the slaughter, for the \u201cblood\u201d will flow from \u201cthe mountains,\u201d as if the very mountains were melted, just as when the waters run down violently after heavy showers, and sweep away the soil along with them. Thus, also, he shows that there will be no means of escape, because the sword will rage as cruelly on the very mountains as on the field of battle.<\/p> ",
