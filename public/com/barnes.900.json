    "html": "<p><em>With arrows and with bows...<\/em> &mdash;This is a continuation of the description of its desolation. So entirely would it be abandoned, so utterly desolate would it be, that it would become a vast hunting-ground. It would be covered with shrubs and trees that would afford a convenient covert for wild beasts; and would yield to its few inhabitants a subsistence, not by cultivation, but by the bow and the arrow. There can scarcely be a more striking description of utter desolation. But, perhaps, the long captivity of seventy years in Babylon literally fulfilled it. Judea was a land that, at all times, was subject to depredations from wild beasts. On the banks of the Jordan&mdash;in the marshes, and amid the reeds that sprung up in the lower bank or border of the river&mdash;the lion found a home, and the tiger a resting place; compare<a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 49:19<\/a> . When the land was for a little time vacated and forsaken, it would be, therefore, soon filled with wild beasts; and during the desolations of the seventy years&rsquo; captivity, there can be no doubt that this was literally fulfilled.<\/p> ",
