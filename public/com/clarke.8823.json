Hosea, chap, <a class=\"ref\">Hosea 12:1 <\/a>,, reproaches the Israelites for the same practice: - <\/p>,\n\n <p>\"They make a covenant with Assyria, <\/p>,\n\n <p>And oil is carried to Egypt.\" <\/p>,\n\n <p>It is well known, that in all parts of the east, whoever visits a great person must carry him a present. \"It is counted uncivil,\" says Maundreg, p. 26, \"to visit in this country without an offering in hand. All great men expect it as a tribute due to their character and authority; and look upon themselves as affronted, and indeed defrauded, when the compliment is omitted.\" Hence <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05e9\u05d5\u05e8 <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">,shur <\/span>,, to visit a person, is equivalent to making him a present; and <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05ea\u05e9\u05d5\u05e8\u05d4 <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">,teshurah <\/span>,signifies a present made on such occasions; as our translators have rightly rendered it, <a class=\"ref\">1 Samuel 9:7 <\/a>; on which Jarchi says <i>Menachem exponit <\/i> <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05ea\u05e9\u05d5\u05e8\u05d4 <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">,teshurah <\/span>,, <i>quod significat oblationem sive manus, ut aliquis aspiciat faciem regis, aut alicuius magnatis <\/i>,. \"Menachem expounds <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05ea\u05e9\u05d5\u05e8\u05d4 <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">,teshurah <\/span>,of an offering or gift which is presented in order to be admitted into the presence of the king or some great man.\" <\/p>,",
