They were probably given about the same time and represent the message of hope which Isaiah seems always to hold out in contrast to the message of doom previously announced. They appear to be one continuous revelation, probably divided into chapters some time after Isaiah's day. The judgments of God which are to come upon the defiled earth are described in 24:1-12. This is followed by a description of the Lord's people in the isles of the sea (Zion; see 24:13-25:12) and a description of the Lord's people Judah (see chapter 26); chapter 27 is a summation of those descriptions. Nephi, in commenting upon Isaiah, follows a similar pattern: he speaks of separate peoples, then gives a summation chapter about these groups (see <a class=\"ref\">2 Ne. 25-30<\/a>). A more detailed outline follows.<\/p>     <p>1. The whole earth is defiled and will be burned (24:1-12).<\/p>     <p>a. The earth (land) will become waste and desolate and the people scattered (24:1).<\/p>     <p>b. The priest and the people are alike (24:2).<\/p>     <p>c. The laws are transgressed, the ordinances changed, the everlasting covenant broken (24:5).<\/p>     <p>d. Confusion and desolation are left in the city (24:7-12).<\/p>     <p>2. The Lord will be glorified only in the isles of the sea (Zion) and in Jerusalem (24:13-23). <\/p>     <p>a. Praise will be sung elsewhere, but treacherously (24:16-17).<\/p>     <p>b. The pits and the snares will engulf many (24:18).<\/p>     <p>c. The earth will reel to and fro as a drunken man (24:19-20).<\/p>     <p>d. The telestial beings will be shut up in spirit prison (24:21-22).<\/p>     <p>e. The moon will be confounded and the sun ashamed (24:23).<\/p>     <p>3. The Lord will be exalted in Mt. Zion (25:1-12).<\/p>     <p>a. He will break down the strong and strengthen the weak (25:1-5).<\/p>     <p>b. He will make a feast in this mountain (25:6).<\/p>     <p>c. He will destroy the veil of darkness and pour out knowledge (25: 7).<\/p>     <p>d. He will overcome death, sin, and affliction (25:8).<\/p>     <p>e. He will be accepted as God by the people (25:9).<\/p>     <p>f. He will tread down the oppressors of Israel (25:10-12).<\/p>     <p>4. A song will be sung in the land of Judah (26:1-21).<\/p>     <p>a. Jerusalem will trust in Jehovah and be a strong and peaceful city (26:1-4).<\/p>     <p>b. The proud will be brought low and the just led in righteousness (26:5-11).<\/p>     <p>c. Jehovah will be recognized as the only Messiah (26:12-15).<\/p>     <p>d. The Jews will be delivered and their dead resurrected (26:16-19).<\/p>     <p>e. The Lord's people (the Jews) will gather while the earth is punished (26:20-21).<\/p>     <p>5. Jacob will take root, and Israel will blossom and bud (27:1-13).<\/p>     <p>a. The devil will be slain and the wicked burned (27:1-6).<\/p>     <p>b. Jacob will be smitten and purged of iniquity (27:7-11).<\/p>     <p>c. The land given to Abraham will be occupied by Israel as she gathers and worships in the holy mount at Jerusalem (27:12-13). <\/p>     <p>There are about a dozen passages from the other standard works which help us understand these chapters, half of them related to chapter 24. There are also several comments by the General Authorities, but again almost all of them concern chapter 24. While much of the interpretation must be left to the \"spirit of prophecy\" (see <a class=\"ref\">2 Ne. 25:4<\/a>), there are enough guidelines given in the scriptures <i>to<\/i> show <i>the<\/i> overall message.<\/p>     ",
