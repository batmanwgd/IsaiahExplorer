    "html": "<p> (9) O Zion, that bringest good tidings.\u2014A new section begins. In some versions (LXX. and Targum) and by some interpreters \u201cZion\u201d is taken as in the objective case, O thou that bringest glad tidings to Zion; but as the participle, \u201cthou that bringest,\u201d is in the feminine, and a female evangeliser other than Jerusalem has not appeared on the scene, the Authorised Version is preferable. In that rendering the ideal Zion, seeing or hearing of the return of the exiles, becomes the bearer of the good news to the other cities of Judah. It is not without emotion that we note the first occurrence of the word which, passing through the Greek of the LXX. and the New Testament (<span class=\"greek-hebrew\"> \u03b5\u03c5\u03b1\u03b3\u03b3\u03b5\u03bb\u03af\u03c2\u03b5\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9<\/span>), has had so fruitful a history, as embodying the message of the Gospel\u2014good-spell, glad tidings\u2014to mankind. The primary meaning of the Hebrew word is to make smooth, or bright, and so \u201cto gladden.\u201d (Comp. the connection of this English word with the German glatten.)<\/p> \n<p>The high mountain.\u2014There is no article in the Hebrew, but the word is probably connected with the ideal exaltation of the holy city, as in<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3Njg3XQ==\">Isaiah 2:1<\/a> .<\/p> \n<p>Behold your God!\u2014The words have, in one sense, only an ideal fulfilment; but the prophet contemplates the return of the exiles and the restoration of the Temple worship, as involving the renewed presence of Jehovah in the sanctuary which He had apparently abandoned. He would come back with His people, and abide with them.<\/p> ",
