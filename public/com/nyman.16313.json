The Old and New Testament readings of this passage are compared below. (Note: In this study, italics will be used to highlight differences between two or more texts, or to emphasize certain words or phrases. The standard biblical use of italics to denote words added by the King James translators has been ignored.)<\/p>     <p>Except the Lord of hosts had left unto us a very small reinnant, we should have been as Sodom, and we should have been like unto Gomorrah. (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NjY0XQ==\">Isaiah 1:9<\/a>.)<\/p>     <p>And as Esaias said before, Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed, we had been as Sodoma, and been made like unto Gomorrha. (<a class=\"ref\">Rom. 9:29<\/a>.)<\/p>     <p>\"The Lord of Sabaoth,\" as used in Romans, has the same meaning as \"the Lord of hosts\" used in Isaiah, but it is not the same as \"Lord of the Sabbath\" (see <a class=\"ref\">Mark 2:28<\/a>). See <a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 88:2<\/a> for a similar use in a modern revelation. The Romans text's \"seed\" has the same meaning as \"a very small remnant.\"<\/p>     ",
