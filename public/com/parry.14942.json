    "title": "A Prophecy of Judgment against Moab",
    "html": " <p>Moab, which was named after the firstborn son of Lot's eldest daughter (<a class=\"ref\">Gen. 19:37<\/a>), was the nation that bordered the Dead Sea on the east. The prophet warns the Moabites that they will be destroyed, despite the fact that they are prosperous in trading and commerce. The listing of sixteen cities and places in this section, which are located in both the northern and southern regions of Moab, indicates that all of Moab will be affected by the devastation.<\/p> <p>Moabites will mourn and lament their destruction. They will mourn by weeping, howling, shaving their heads, cutting off their beards (15:2), girding with sackcloth, howling on housetops and in the streets (15:3), and crying out to the point that the voice is heard from distant places (\"even unto Jahaz\"); even \"soldiers of Moab shall cry out\" (15:4).<\/p> <blockquote> The burden of Moab.     <br>Because <i>in the night Ar of Moab is laid waste,<\/i> and <i>brought to silence<\/i>;     <br>because<i> in the night Kir of Moab is laid waste,<\/i> and <i>brought to silence<\/i>; (15:1)     <br>He is gone up to Bajith, and to Dibon, the high places, to <i>weep<\/i>:     <br>Moab shall <i>howl<\/i> over Nebo, and over Medeba:     <br>on <i>all their heads<\/i> <u>shall be baldness<\/u>,     <br>and <i>every beard<\/i> <u>cut off<\/u>. (15:2)     <br><i>In their streets<\/i> they shall <u>gird themselves with sackcloth<\/u>:     <br><i>on the tops of their houses, and in their streets,<\/i> <u>every one shall howl<\/u>,<u> weeping<\/u> abundantly. (15:3)     <br>And <i>Heshbon<\/i> <u>shall cry<\/u>, and <i>Elealeh:<\/i>     <br><i>their voice<\/i> <u>shall be heard<\/u> even unto Jahaz:     <br>therefore the <i>armed soldiers<\/i> of Moab <u>shall cry out<\/u>;     <br><i>his life<\/i> <u>shall be grievous<\/u> unto him. (15:4)     <br>My heart shall cry out for Moab; his fugitives shall flee unto Zoar, an heifer of three years old:     <br><i>for by the mounting up of Luhith<\/i> with weeping shall <u>they go it up<\/u>;     <br><i>for in the way of Horonaim<\/i> <u>they shall raise up a cry<\/u> of destruction. (15:5)     <br>For the <i>waters of Nimrim shall be desolate:<\/i> for the <u>hay is withered<\/u> away,     <br>the <u>grass faileth<\/u>, <i>there is no green thing.<\/i> (15:6)     <br>Therefore the <i>abundance<\/i> <u>they have gotten<\/u>,     <br>and <i>that<\/i> which <u>they have laid up<\/u>,     <br>shall they carry away to the brook of the willows. (15:7)     <br>For the <i>cry<\/i> is gone round <u>about the borders of Moab<\/u>;     <br>the <i>howling<\/i> thereof <u>unto Eglaim<\/u>,     <br>and the <i>howling<\/i> thereof <u>unto Beer-elim<\/u>. (15:8)     <br>For the waters of Dimon shall be full of blood:     <br>for I will bring more upon Dimon,     <br>lions upon him that escapeth of Moab,     <br>and upon the remnant of the land.
