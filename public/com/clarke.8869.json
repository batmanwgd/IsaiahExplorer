    "html": "<p><em>The rams of Nebaioth shall minister unto thee\u2014<\/em>Vitringa on the place understands their ministering, and ascending or going up on the altar, as offering themselves voluntarily: <i>ipsi se, non expectato sacerdote alto, gloriae et sanctificationi divini nominis ultro ac libenter oblaturi<\/i>. \"They, waiting for no priest, go and freely offer themselves to the glory and sanctification of the sacred name.\" This gives a very elegant and poetical turn to the image. It was a general notion that prevailed with sacrificers among the heathen, that the victim's being brought without reluctance to the altar was a good omen; and the contrary a bad one. <i>Sabinos petit aliquanto tristior; quod sacrificanti hostia aufugerat<\/i>. Sueton. Titus, cap. 10. <i>Accessit dirum omen, profugus altaribus tauris<\/i>. \"It was an omen of dreadful portent when the victim fled away from the altar.\" Tacit. Hist. 3:56. - L.<\/p>",
