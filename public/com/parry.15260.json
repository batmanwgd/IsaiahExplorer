Judah's trusting in Egypt's horses, chariots, and armies for deliverance and temporal salvation is no different from our trusting in tanks, warplanes, or personal weapons\u2014or money and temporal security. We can and should learn from history's lessons. If we trust in the Lord's power to protect us, both spiritually and physically, he will \"defend\" us, \"deliver\" us, and \"preserve\" us (31:5).<\/i><\/p> ",
