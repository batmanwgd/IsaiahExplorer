    "html": " <p> <em>Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell <\/em>&mdash;Hebrew, &lsquo;To sheol&rsquo; (compare <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3OTM4XQ==\">Isaiah 14:9<\/a>). <\/p> <p> <em>To the sides of the pit <\/em>&mdash;The word &lsquo;pit,&rsquo; here, is evidently synonymous with &ldquo;hell&rdquo; or &ldquo;hades,&rdquo; represented as a deep, dark region under ground. The dead were often buried in caves, and the descent was often dark and dreary, to the vaults where they reposed. Hence, it is always represented as going down; or, as the &ldquo;inferior&rdquo; regions. The &rsquo;sides of the pit&rsquo; here stand opposed to the &rsquo;sides of the north.&rsquo; He had sought to &ldquo;ascend&rdquo; to the one; he should be &ldquo;brought down&rdquo; to the other. The reference here is, doubtless, to the land of shades; to the dark and dismal regions where the departed dead are supposed to dwell&mdash;to &ldquo;sheol.&rdquo; So the parallelism proves. But the image or figure is taken from the custom of burying, where, in a deep natural cavern, or a sepulchre excavated from a rock, the dead were ranged around the &ldquo;sides&rdquo; of the cavern in niches or recesses excavated for that purpose (see the note at <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3OTM4XQ==\">Isaiah 14:9<\/a>). <\/p> ",
