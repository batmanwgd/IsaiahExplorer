    "html": " <p> <i>That ye may suck. <\/i> This verse ought to be joined with the preceding verse; for the Prophet explains what shall be the occasion of joy, namely, because the wretched and miserable condition of the Church shall be changed into a happy and prosperous condition. By the word \u201csuck\u201d he makes an allusion to young infants; as if he had said, \u201cThat you may enjoy your mother with every advantage, and may hang on her breasts.\u201d Here all believers, whatever may be their age, are compared by him to children, that they may remember their infirmity and may be confirmed by the strength of the Lord; and therefore this metaphor of \u201csucking\u201d and \u201cmilking\u201d ought to be carefully observed. <\/p> \n <p> <i>From the breast of her consolations. <\/i> Some take the word \u201cconsolations\u201d in an active, and others in a passive sense; but I prefer to adopt the passive signification; for he means the consolations which the Church has received, and of which he makes his children partakers. And indeed none can be greater or more abundant, none can be more excellent, than that ground of joy; and this appears more clearly from the following clause, \u201cthat ye may be delighted with the brightness of her glory.\u201d <\/p> ",
