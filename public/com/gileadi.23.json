The name &ldquo;Jehovah of Hosts&rdquo; or &ldquo;Jehovah of Armies&rdquo; (<em>yhwh seba&rsquo;ot<\/em>) alludes to the legions, heavenly and earthly, he has at his disposal to implement his decrees. The title &ldquo;Valiant One of Israel&rdquo; expresses his divine attribute of valor. His pronunciation of a &ldquo;woe&rdquo; or covenant curse makes this a formal condemnation of his people. The &ldquo;adversaries&rdquo; and &ldquo;enemies&rdquo; of whom Jehovah avenges himself are their apostate ecclesiastical leaders ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NjY1XQ==\">v 10<\/a>) and corrupt politicians ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3Njc4XQ==\">v 23<\/a>; cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxNzc0N10seyIxNzc2NCI6Mn0seyIxNzg1MiI6Nn1d\">Isaiah 5:7, 24-25; 10:1-6<\/a>).<\/p> ",
