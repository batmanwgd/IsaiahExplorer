We return to the king\u2019s thoughts of the dim shadow-world, Death and Sheol (joined together, as in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 28:15<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 6:5<\/a>). In that region of dimness there are no psalms of thanksgiving, no loud hallelujahs. The thought of spiritual energies developed and intensified after death is essentially one which belongs to the \u201cilluminated\u201d immortality (<a class=\"ref\">2 Timothy 1:10<\/a>), of Christian thought. (Comp. <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 6:5; Psalms 30:9; Psalms 88:11-12; Psalms 115:17; Ecclesiastes 9:4-5; Ecclesiastes 9:10<\/a>).<\/p>",
