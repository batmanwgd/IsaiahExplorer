    "html": " <p>The words that Isaiah used to describe this latter-day condition of Zion are important. <em>Hephzi-bah <\/em> means &ldquo;delightful&rdquo; in Hebrew and may refer to Jerusalem and Zion&rsquo;s latter-day righteousness. <em>Beulah <\/em> means &ldquo;union&rdquo; (see <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODU5XQ==\">Isaiah 62:4<\/a>). A marriage is once again the symbol of unity, but this time the marriage is not of the people and God but of the land and God. <\/p> <p>According to the Doctrine and Covenants, there will come a time when &ldquo;the land of Jerusalem and the land of Zion shall be turned back into their own place, and the earth shall be like as it was in the days before it was divided&rdquo; (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 133:24<\/a>). In the days of Peleg the earth was divided into continents (see <a class=\"ref\">Genesis 10:25<\/a>), but before that time it was all united in one land mass. The joining of the continents once again can be likened to a union or a marriage that is both <em>hephzi-bah <\/em> and <em>beulah, <\/em> that is, delightful and united. The lands, like a man and woman in holy wedlock, will be sealed by the authority of the one officiating (see <a class=\"ref\">JST, Isaiah 62:4&ndash;5<\/a>). <\/p> <p class=\"cite\"> LDS Church Educational System Old Testament Student Manual, 1 Kings&ndash;Malachi, Religion 302, Chapter 18, Item 21 <\/p> ",
