St. Paul expounds it by <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u03bb\u03b1\u03bf\u03bd \u03b1\u03c0\u03b5\u03b9\u03b8\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u03b3\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1<\/span>, <i>A people not persuaded, not believing,<\/i>, or, <i>not obeying;<\/i>, but <i>gainsaying,<\/i>, or, <i>contradicting<\/i>, the word and will of God. <i>Which walketh in a way that is not good <\/i>\u2014Less is expressed than is intended: the meaning is, in a way that is very bad. <i>After their own thoughts <\/i>\u2014Or, as it is elsewhere expressed, after the imaginations of their hearts; a usual phrase to describe sin, especially in the matter of God\u2019s worship. The Prophet Jeremiah expresses sin in this manner many times. <\/p>",
