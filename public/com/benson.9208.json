The wine, figuratively speaking, mourns, because there are none, or none but enemies to God and Israel, to drink it. <i>The vine languisheth <\/i>\u2014 Because there are no people left to dress it, or gather its grapes; or because it is broken down and spoiled by the enemy. In other words, the vineyards are destroyed, and the fruits of the earth consumed by hostile invasions. <i>The mirth of tabrets ceaseth <\/i>\u2014 There is no place for mirth or rejoicing, much less for the usual expressions of it, when men are under such great calamities. <i>They shall not drink wine with a song \u2014 <\/i>Those that can command wine under this scarcity will have no heart to drink it: nor would it, if drunk, be able to cheer their spirits amidst such great troubles.<\/p>",
