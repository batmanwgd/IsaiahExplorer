It is introduced by the sixth and final woe in the series begun in chapter 28, but this one is not addressed to the people of Israel or its leaders. It is addressed to the enemy of Jerusalem, almost certainly Assyria. The true king is the one who can bring about the deliverance that the drunken leaders cannot. The unit is divided into two parts. The first (33:1\u20136) includes the \u201cwoe\u201d itself (v. 1) and an appeal to God (v. 2) based on his character and power (vv. 3\u20136). The second part (33:7\u2013 16) begins with a statement of the hopelessness of the situation (vv. 7\u20139) and moves to a promise by God to take action (vv. 10\u201316). Surely such a God should be trusted.<\/p>     ",
