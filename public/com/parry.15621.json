The rebellious resist righteousness, but God will bring his own righteousness (or salvation) to bless those of Zion. As Paul taught, our diligent efforts to be righteous help us come unto Christ, who then blesses us with salvation (<a class=\"ref\">Rom. 3:20-24; 5:19<\/a>). Some versions of the Bible use the word <i>victory<\/i> instead of righteousness (JB, NEB, TEV). The Lord brings victory over sin and death, which is his salvation.<\/p> ",
