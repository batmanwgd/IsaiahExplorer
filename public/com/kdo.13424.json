It gave them to understand, that no meritorious work of their own would come in between what Israel was and what it was to be, but that it was God's free grace which came to meet it. <i>\u201cBut now thus saith Jehovah thy Creator, O Jacob, and thy Former, O Israel! Fear not, for I have redeemed thee; I have called thee by name, thou art mine. When thou goest through the water, I am with thee; and through rivers, they shall not drown thee: when thou goest into fire, thou shalt not be burned; and the flame shall not set thee on fire.\u201d<\/i> The punishment has now lasted quite long enough; and, as<span class=\"normal hebrew\"> \u05d5\u05e2\ufb4a\u05d4<\/span> affirms, the love which has hitherto retreated behind the wrath returns to its own prerogatives again. He who created and formed Israel, by giving Abraham the son of the promise, and caused the seventy of Jacob's family to grow up into a nation in Egypt, He also will shelter and preserve it.

I have called with thy name, i.e., called it out), to its call to be the peculiar people of Jehovah, who therefore speaks of it in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NjI3XQ==\">Isaiah 48:12<\/a> as \u201cMy called.\u201d This help of the God of Israel will also continue to arm it against the destructive power of the most hostile elements, and rescue it from the midst of the greatest dangers, from which there is apparently no escape (cf., <a class=\"ref\">Psalm 66:12; Daniel 3:17, Daniel 3:27<\/a>; and Ges. \u00a7103, 2). <br><\/p> ",
