I know is supplied by many versions and commentators; I will punish or I have seen by others. The thought, in any case, is that the eye of Jehovah sees the evil things that are done in the secret places, caves or groves, in which the heathen rites were celebrated. <\/p> \n <p>All nations and tongues . . .\u2014The phrase, though not incompatible with Isaiah\u2019s authorship, is specially characteristic of the prophets of the Exile (<a class=\"ref\">Daniel 3:4; Daniel 3:7; Daniel 3:29; Daniel 4:1; Zechariah 8:23 <\/a>). <\/p> \n <p>They shall come, and see my glory.\u2014The \u201cglory\u201d in the prophet\u2019s thoughts is that of Jehovah manifested in His righteous judgments on open enemies and concealed apostates. <\/p> ",
