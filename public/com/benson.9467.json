And those whom he comforts, are comforted indeed.\u201d<i>Who art thou, that thou shouldest be afraid,<\/i> &c.\u2014How unreasonable and distrustful art thou, O my church, how unlike to thyself! How unsuitable are these despondences to thy professions and obligations!<i>Afraid of a man that shall die,<\/i> &c.\u2014Of a weak, mortal, and perishing creature. <i>And forgettest the Lord thy Maker<\/i>\u2014Dost not consider the infinite power of that God who made thee, and who will plead thy cause;<i>that hath stretched forth the heavens, and laid the foundations of the earth<\/i>\u2014And therefore hath all the hosts and all the powers of both at his command and disposal. <i>And hast feared continually every day<\/i>\u2014Hast been in a state of continual alarm and disquietude;<i>because of the fury of the oppressor<\/i>\u2014It is true there is an oppressor, and he is furious, designing, it may be, to do thee a mischief, and therefore it will be thy wisdom to be on thy guard against him: but thou art afraid of him, <i>as if he were ready to destroy<\/i>\u2014As if it were in his power to destroy thee in a moment, and he were just now going to effect his purpose, and there were no possibility of preventing it. <i>And where is the fury of the oppressor?<\/i>\u2014What is become of the power and rage of the Babylonians? Are they not vanished away? Are they not broken, and thou delivered? He speaks of the thing as already done, because it should certainly and suddenly be done.<\/p> ",
