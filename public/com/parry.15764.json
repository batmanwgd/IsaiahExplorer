    "html": " <i>oppressed\/afflicted.<\/i> Jesus was oppressed and afflicted throughout his ministry, as the Gospels record. But this passage seems to refer particularly to the legal trials he suffered immediately before his crucifixion (<a class=\"ref\">Matt. 26:67-68; 27:29<\/a>). <\/p> <p> <i>he opened not his mouth.<\/i> This prophecy was fulfilled when Jesus appeared before Herod, who \"questioned with him in many words; but he answered him nothing\" (<a class=\"ref\">Luke 23:9<\/a>). When Jesus stood before Pilate, Mark records, \"the chief priests accused him of many things: but he answered nothing. And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how many things they witness against thee. But Jesus yet answered nothing\" (<a class=\"ref\">Mark 15:3-5<\/a>). <\/p> <p><i>lamb to the slaughter.<\/i> Not only is Christ the Good Shepherd (<a class=\"ref\">John 10:14<\/a>) but he is also the sacrificial lamb, which went without protest or resistance to his death. This is in contrast to us, as the sheep of the previous verse, who willfully went astray. The sacrifice of an unblemished lamb under the law of Moses prefigured the atoning sacrifice of Christ (<a class=\"ref\">Gen. 22:7-8; Ex. 12:3<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\">Lev. 5:7<\/a>): the Atonement fulfills the symbolism of the lamb.<\/p> ",
