    "html": "<p>As Jehovah rewards evil for evil, so the &ldquo;catastrophe&rdquo; or &ldquo;evil&rdquo; (<em>ra&lsquo;a<\/em>) the Harlot Babylon causes in people&rsquo;s lives comes back on herself. Although in her profligacy she could bribe her way out of trouble, she doesn&rsquo;t succeed this time. Her flaws are incurable and her oppression of Zion has reached saturation point (<a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 51:24-25<\/a>). &ldquo;Disaster&rdquo; and &ldquo;sudden ruin&rdquo; beyond all imagining are the order of the day: &ldquo;She has fallen; Babylon has fallen. All her idol gods he has razed to the ground&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 21:9<\/a>); &ldquo;At evening time shall be the catastrophe, and before morning they shall be no more&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 17:14<\/a>).<\/p>",
