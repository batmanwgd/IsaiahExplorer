    "html": "<p><b>(<a class=\"ref\">3 Nephi 20:36<\/a>).<\/b>\"<i>Awake, awake <u>again<\/u>.<\/i>\" This is a command for the Lord's people to cease their spiritual slumbering, to shake off their apathy. In describing the spiritual awakening that had come to some converts to Christ, Alma said they were \"awakened \u2026 out of a deep sleep, and they awoke unto God.\" (<a class=\"ref\">Alma 5:7<\/a>.) Jacob had earlier admonished some who were spiritually asleep to \"arouse the faculties of your souls; shake yourselves that ye may awake from the slumber of death.\" (<a class=\"ref\">Jacob 3:11<\/a>.)<\/p>     <p>The prophetic plea is to \"awake before it is too late!\" We remember the fate of the young man named Eutychus, who fell asleep during the apostle Paul's sermon: he fell to his death. (<a class=\"ref\">Acts 20:9<\/a>.) Surely we should be more concerned about the risks of falling to our spiritual death.<\/p>     <p>The Book of Mormon text adds the word \"again\" to the imperative to awake. \"This was probably because Zion, or America, was 'awakening' at the time of the Savior's visit and 'putting on her strength,' but the Savior knew that within 400 years the Nephites would lose that strength and fall again into a spiritual sleep. The use of the word 'again' indicates a dual interpretation of the Isaiah text in this instance, and supports the idea that there are other dual interpretations through Isaiah.\" (GAWI, 197.)<\/p>",
