    "html": "<p> The threat is now followed by a promise. This is essentially the same in character as <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\"> ought to stand at <em> hammishpa\u0302t <\/em> ; the second clause of the v. may be completed from the first, \u05d5\u05dc\u05d2\u05d1\u05d5\u05bc\u05e8\u05d4 being equivalent to \u05d2\u05d1\u05d5\u05e8\u05d4 \u05d5\u05dc\u05e8\u05d5\u05d7 , and \u05de\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05d9 to \u05dc\u05de\u05d9\u05e9\u05d1\u05d9 . We might regard 2 Chron 30 as a fulfilment of what is predicted in <a class=\"isa\">Isaiah 28:6<\/a>, if the feast of passover there described really fell in the age succeeding the fall of Samaria; for this feast of passover did furnish a representation and awaken a consciousness of that national unity which had been interrupted from the time of Rehoboam. But if we read the account in the Chronicles with unprejudiced minds, it is impossible to shut our eyes to the fact that this feast of passover took place in the second month of the first year of Hezekiah's reign, and therefore not after the depopulation of the northern kingdom by Shalmanassar, but after the previous and partial depopulation by Tiglath-pileser. In fact, the fulfilment cannot be looked for at all in the space between the sixth and fourteenth years of Hezekiah, since the condition of Judah during that time does not answer at all to the promises given above. The prophet here foretells what might be hoped for, when Asshur had not only humbled Ephraim, but Judah also. The address consists of two connected halves, the promising beginnings of which point to one and the same future, and lay hold of one another.<\/p>",
