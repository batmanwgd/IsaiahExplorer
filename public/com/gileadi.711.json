    "html": "<p>Even as they appeal to Jehovah for help, this category of his people wallows in self-deception, blaming him for their waywardness. They resemble people who practice a delusional form of religion, relying on what others have taught them, not on Jehovah&rsquo;s law and word as he reveals it: &ldquo;These people approach me with the mouth and pay me homage with their lips, while their heart remains far from me, their piety toward me consisting of commandments of men learned by rote&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MjA3XQ==\">Isaiah 29:13<\/a>). Consequently, Jehovah&rsquo;s Day of Judgment catches them unprepared and as yet unrepentant of their sins.<\/p><p>The expression &ldquo;for the sake of&rdquo; alludes to the role of proxy saviors under the terms of the Davidic Covenant who bear others&rsquo; transgressions and intercede on their behalf so that Jehovah may deliver them from harm or destruction (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODM4OF0seyIxODcyMyI6Mn0sWzE4OTA2XV0=\">Isaiah 37:35; 53:11-12; 65:8<\/a>). That principle of temporal salvation, however, operates only when its beneficiaries&mdash;though not yet righteous before God&mdash;are in a state of repentance. The parallelism of Jehovah&rsquo;s &ldquo;servants&rdquo; with &ldquo;the tribes that are your inheritance&rdquo; identifies Jehovah&rsquo;s servants with Israel&rsquo;s twelve tribes (cf.<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODY0MywxODkwN10seyIxODkxMSI6M31d\">Isaiah 49:6; 65:9, 13-15<\/a> ;<a class=\"ref\">Revelation 7:3-8<\/a>).<\/p> ",
