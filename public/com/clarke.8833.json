The great subject of thanksgiving is peace, reconciliation and pardon, offered to them that are nigh, and to them that are afar off, not only to the Jew, but also to the Gentile, as St. Paul more than once applies those terms, <a class=\"ref\">Ephesians 2:13, Ephesians 2:17<\/a>. See also <a class=\"ref\">Acts 2:39<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n <p>Peace to him that is far off \"That is, to the penitent; and to him that is near, i.e., the righteous.\" - Kimchi. <\/p>",
