It is with peculiar propriety and elegance that the nations are here called upon and exhorted to praise and extol Jehovah, for the singular blessing conferred upon them by the gospel. <i>And his praise from the end of the earth <\/i>\u2014 All nations, from one end of the earth to another. <i>Ye that go down to the sea <\/i>\u2014 You that go by sea, carry these glad tidings from Judea, where Christ was born, and lived, and died, and published the gospel, unto the remotest parts of the earth. <i>Let the wilderness, <\/i>&c. \u2014 Those parts of the world which are now desolate and forsaken of God, and barren of all good fruits. <i>The villages that Kedar doth inhabit <\/i>\u2014 The Arabians, who were a heathen and barbarous people, and are put for all nations. <i>Let them shout from the top of the mountains <\/i>\u2014 Whose inhabitants are commonly more savage and ignorant than others. <i>Let them declare his praise in the islands <\/i>\u2014 In the remotest parts of the world, as well as in Arabia, which was near to them.<\/p>",
