    "title": "What Are Seraphim?",
    "html": " <p> <em>&ldquo;Seraphs <\/em> are angels who reside in the presence of God, giving continual glory, honor, and adoration to him. &lsquo;Praise ye him, all his angels: praise ye him, all his hosts.&rsquo; (<a class=\"ref\">Ps. 148:2<\/a>.) It is clear that seraphs include the unembodied spirits of pre-existence, for our Lord &lsquo;looked upon the wide expanse of eternity, and <em>all the seraphic hosts of heaven, before the world was made.&rsquo; <\/em> (<a class=\"ref\">D. &amp; C. 38:1<\/a>.) Whether the name seraphs also applies to perfected and resurrected angels is not clear. While petitioning on behalf of the saints, the Prophet prayed that &lsquo;we may mingle our voices with those bright, shining seraphs around thy throne, with acclamations of praise, singing Hosanna to God and the Lamb!&rsquo; (<a class=\"ref\">D. &amp; C. 109:79<\/a>.) <\/p> <p>&ldquo;In Hebrew the plural of seraph is <em>seraphim <\/em> or, as incorrectly recorded in the King James Version of the Bible, <em>seraphims<\/em>. Isaiah saw seraphim in vision and heard them cry one to another &lsquo;Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of hosts; the whole earth is full of his glory.&rsquo; (<a class=\"ref\">JST Isa. 6:1&ndash;8<\/a>.) The fact that these holy beings were shown to him as having wings was simply to symbolize their &lsquo;power, to move, to act, etc.&rsquo; as was the case also in visions others had received. (<a class=\"ref\">D. &amp; C. 77:4<\/a>.)&rdquo; (Bruce R.
