Though they stood high in wealth and in power, yet their <i>hearts <\/i>,would be so <i>faint <\/i>,, and their <i>hands <\/i>,so <i>weak <\/i>,, that they would have neither disposition nor ability to resist. And thus he indirectly ridicules the cruelty which boiled in the hearts of the Babylonians; for it is in the power of God to soften <i>hearts <\/i>,, and to crush, loosen, or enfeeble <i>hands <\/i>,or <i>arms <\/i>,, so that suddenly all their courage shall fall down, and all their strength shall vanish away. When the heart quakes, what will be the use of fortifications, or armies, or wealth, or bulwarks? What avails a well-stocked workshop without a workman? We see this every day exemplified in those to whom in other respects the Lord had communicated large resources. Hence we see how vain is that confidence which we place in outward resources; for they would be of no use to us, if the Lord should strike our hearts with any alarm. <\/p>,",
