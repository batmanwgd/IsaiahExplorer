Thus Bishop Lowth observes, \u201cThe obvious, literal meaning of the prophecy, not excluding a higher secondary sense, is this: \u2018That, within the time that a young woman, now a virgin, should conceive, and bring forth a child, and that child should arrive at such an age as to distinguish between good and evil, that is, within a few years, <\/p>\n <p>(compare <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODEyXQ==\">Isaiah 8:4<\/a>,) the enemies of Judah should be destroyed.\u2019\u201d But, surely, as Dr. Doddridge observes, on <a class=\"ref\">Matthew 1:23<\/a>, \u201cA son\u2019s being born of one, then a virgin, when she was married, was no such miraculous event as to answer such a pompous introduction\u201d as we have here. Of this the reader may easily judge by attending to the prophet\u2019s words, and a short and easy paraphrase upon them. <i>Ask thee a sign of the Lord thy God<\/i>,\u2014 <i><\/i>, A sign is a miracle wrought for the confirmation of some message, promise, or doctrine delivered from God. \u201cSome unusual or extraordinary effect, production, or phenomenon, which could not be explained from natural causes, but only from the omnipotence of the Ruler of the universe; which, moreover, signified that God was present, and ratified the word, or declaration, for which the sign was given.\u201d See <a class=\"ref\">Exodus 4:8;<\/a>; <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDEzXQ==\">Isaiah 38:22<\/a>. <i>Ask it either in the depth, or in the height above <\/i>\u2014Demand some prodigy to be wrought, either in earth or heaven, at thy pleasure. By speaking thus, the prophet signified that \u201call nature was subject to the power and control of that God, whom he calls the God of Ahaz, as being the God of his fathers, and in order to admonish him wherein to place his confidence.\u201d <i>But Ahaz said, I will not ask <\/i>\u2014This refusal did not proceed from faith in God and true humility, but rather from his contempt of God, and disregard of his word, as is sufficiently evident from the history of his life. He probably feared lest, if such a sign should be given as he did not choose, he should be compelled to desist from his purpose of calling in the aid of Assyria, which he could not well have called in after Jehovah had given a sign to the contrary. Besides, he did not dare to commit himself to that divine favour and providence, which he had heretofore so proudly despised; preferring to it the protection of other and false deities. See Vitringa. <i>Neither will I tempt the Lord <\/i>\u2014By distrusting his providence, or asking a sign, as if I questioned the truth of his word. But this was deep hypocrisy, as appears by the prophet\u2019s answer. <\/p>",
