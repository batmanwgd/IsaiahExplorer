And this may seem the most proper and suitable, that the sin of the city should be pointed out in this word, as the punishment is expressed in the next; <i>is<\/i> <i>broken down <\/i>\u2014 Its walls, palaces, and temple battered down and demolished; <i>every house is shut up <\/i>\u2014 Either for fear of the enemy, who have entered the city, or because the inhabitants are either fled or dead, or gone into captivity. This seems to be only applicable to the destruction of the city by the Chaldeans, or by the Romans. <i>There is a crying for wine <\/i>\u2014 For the want or loss of their wine; or for the spoiling of the vintage, whereby they were deprived of the means both of their profit and pleasure. <i>In the city is desolation <\/i>\u2014 In Jerusalem itself, that had been so much frequented, there shall be left nothing but desolation; grass shall grow in the streets. <i>The gate is smitten with destruction \u2014 <\/i>The gates of the city are totally ruined, so that the enemy may enter when and where they please. Or, all that used to pass and repass through the gates are smitten, and all the strength of the city is destroyed. How soon can God make a city of order, a city of confusion; and then it will soon be a city of desolation!<\/p>",
