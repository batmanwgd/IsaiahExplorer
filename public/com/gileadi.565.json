    "html": "<p>Jehovah&rsquo;s calling his servant &ldquo;Israel&rdquo; parallels Jehovah&rsquo;s calling his people&rsquo;s ancestor Jacob by his new name Israel after Jacob had proven loyal to him (<a class=\"ref\">Genesis 32:28<\/a>). The servant&rsquo;s receiving a new name, in other words&mdash;which the name Israel here symbolizes&mdash;attests to his ascent to a higher spiritual level after he has proven loyal to Jehovah. It also implies that he&mdash;Jehovah&rsquo;s individual servant&mdash;serves as a surrogate of and as an exemplar to Jehovah&rsquo;s collective servant; that is, to Jehovah&rsquo;s people in the Jacob\/Israel category to whom Jehovah sends him (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg2NDIiOjV9LFsxODQ3OV0seyIxODQ4NyI6Mn0sWzE4NjMxXV0=\">vv 5-9; Isaiah 41:27; 42:6-7; 48:16<\/a>).<\/p><p>One way the servant proves loyal is to continue laboring in Jehovah&rsquo;s cause even in the face of few positive results. By all appearances, he at first spends a great deal of energy &ldquo;in vain&rdquo; and &ldquo;for nothing and to no purpose.&rdquo; And yet, desiring to serve Jehovah even under the most adversarial conditions (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODY0NF0seyIxODY2OSI6NH0seyIxODcxMCI6Mn1d\">v 7; Isaiah 50:6-9; 52:13-14<\/a>), he submits to Jehovah&rsquo;s will: &ldquo;My Lord Jehovah has endowed me with a learned tongue, that I may know how to preach to those grown weary a word to wake them up&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NjY3XQ==\">Isaiah 50:4<\/a>). Before ascending to Isaiah&rsquo;s seraph level, he descends through trials that consume him.<\/p> ",
