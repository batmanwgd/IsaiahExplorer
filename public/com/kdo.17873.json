    "html": "<p> Thus the first hymnic echo dies away; and the eschatological prophecy, coming back to <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTE5XQ==\">Isaiah 24:23<\/a>, but with deeper prayerlike penetration, proceeds thus in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTI1XQ==\">Isaiah 25:6<\/a> : <em> \u201cAnd Jehovah of hosts prepares for all nations upon this mountain a feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees, of fat things rich in marrow, of wines on the lees thoroughly strained.\u201d<\/em> \u201c<em> This mountain<\/em> \u201d is Zion, the seat of God's presence, and the place of His church's worship. The feast is therefore a spiritual one. The figure is taken, as in <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 22:27<\/a>., from the sacrificial meals connected with the <em> shela\u0302mim <\/em> (the peace-offerings). <em> Sh e ma\u0302rim <\/em> <em> m e zukka\u0302kim <\/em> are wines which have been left to stand upon their lees after the first fermentation is over, which have thus thoroughly fermented, and have been kept a long time (from <em> sha\u0302mar <\/em> , to keep, <em> spec<\/em> . to allow to ferment), and which are then filtered before drinking (Gr. \u03bf\u03b9\u0313\u0342\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c3\u03b1\u03ba\u03ba\u03b9\u0301\u03b1\u03c2 , i.e., \u03b4\u03b9\u03c5\u0344\u03bb\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03b5\u0301\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 or \u03b4\u03b9\u03b7\u03b8\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u0300\u03c2 , from \u03b4\u03b9\u03b7\u03b8\u03b5\u03b9\u0342\u03bd , <em> percolare <\/em> ), hence wine both strong and clear. <em> Memucha\u0302y\u0131\u0304m <\/em> might mean <em> emedullatae <\/em> (\u201cwith the marrow taken out;\u201d compare, perhaps, <a class=\"ref\">Proverbs 31:3<\/a>), but this could only apply to the bones, not to the fat meat itself; the meaning is therefore \u201cmixed with marrow,\u201d made marrowy, <em> m edullosae <\/em> . The thing symbolized in this way is the full enjoyment of blessedness in the perfected kingdom of God. The heathen are not only humbled so that they submit to Jehovah, but they also take part in the blessedness of His church, and are abundantly satisfied with the good things of His house, and made to drink of pleasure as from a river (<a class=\"ref\">Psalms 36:9<\/a>). The ring of the v. is inimitably pictorial. It is like joyful music to the heavenly feast. The more flexible form \u05de\u05de\u05d7\u05d9\u05d9\u05dd (from the original, \u05de\u05de\u05d7\u05d9 = \u05de\u05de\u05d7\u05d4 ) is intentionally chosen in the place of \u05de\u05de\u05bc\u05e1\u05d4\u05d9 \u05dd . It is as if we heard stringed instruments played with the most rapid movement of the bow.<\/p>",
