    "html": " <p>Some of Jehovah&rsquo;s people who wade through end-time calamities continue to call on Jehovah (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODg4MiI6NX0=\">Isaiah 63:15-19<\/a>), this time harking back to his descent on Mount Sinai anciently (<a class=\"ref\">Exodus 19:16-20<\/a>). Instead of blaming him for their afflictions as before, however (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODg0XQ==\">Isaiah 63:17<\/a>), they acknowledge their guilt (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODgxMyI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 59:12-13<\/a>) and appeal to him to deliver them (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODg5MSI6NX0=\">vv 5-9<\/a>). This shows that the covenant curses they encounter are having the desired effect of inducing them to repent. Hope thus exists for some who fail to participate in the new exodus but who may nevertheless survive to see Jehovah&rsquo;s coming. <\/p> <p>The synonymous <strong>a<\/strong>,- <strong>b<\/strong>,- <strong>a<\/strong>, mini-chiasm of &ldquo;mountains melting at your presence&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODg3XQ==\">v 1<\/a>)&mdash; <strong>a<\/strong>, &ldquo;nations\/Gentiles trembling at your presence&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODg4XQ==\">v 2<\/a>)&mdash; <strong>b<\/strong>, and &ldquo;mountains quaking before you\/at your presence&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODg5XQ==\">v 3<\/a>)&mdash; <strong>a<\/strong>, identifies the term &ldquo;mountains&rdquo; as a metaphor for &ldquo;nations&rdquo; (cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc2OTgiOjN9LFsxNzc2NSwxODM3NywxODQ2NywxODcwNF1d\">Isaiah 2:12-14; 5:25; 37:24; 41:15; 52:7<\/a>). Because the Hebrew verbs are synonyms, and because all three instances of &ldquo;at your presence\/before you&rdquo; are identical, the chiasm&rsquo;s remaining components are thus also synonymous. Parallel component of <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3OTExXQ==\">Isaiah 13:4<\/a>, similarly identify &ldquo;mountains&rdquo; as a metaphor for &ldquo;kingdoms.&rdquo; <\/p>",
