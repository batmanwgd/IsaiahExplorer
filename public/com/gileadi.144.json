As society breaks down, enmity between neighbors (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzEzXQ==\">Isaiah 3:5<\/a>) spreads to contention between the different races and tribal groups of Jehovah&rsquo;s people&mdash;Ephraim, Manasseh, and Judah. The Jews&mdash;humanity&rsquo;s perennial scapegoats&mdash;inevitably suffer yet another outbreak of anti-Semitism as the wicked of the world attempt to pass off their own guilt onto others. Even so, Jehovah&rsquo;s punishments continue unabated.<\/p>",
