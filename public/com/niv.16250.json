Although she is beautiful and \u201cdelicate,\u201d like a \u201cvirgin daughter\u201d of kings, she will be forced to do menial labor (47:2). More than that, she will be sexually humiliated. This language is used elsewhere in the Old Testament to describe being taken into exile (cf. 20:4) and to refer to nations who have allied themselves with other nations being failed or mistreated by those allies.<\/p>         <p>\u2003Babylon had been on the mistreating end of that relationship for a long time, but the time is coming when she will experience what she has meted out to others. This introductory stanza is brought to a conclusion with an ejaculation of praise to the One who is bringing all this to pass, \u201cthe Holy One of Israel.\u201d He may not have seemed much to great Babylon, but he is \u201cYahweh of Heaven\u2019s Armies\u201d (<small>NIV<\/small> \u201cL<small>ORD<\/small> Almighty\u201d), and in any contest for greatness with him, Babylon does not have a chance.<\/p>         ",
