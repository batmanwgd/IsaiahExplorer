    "html": "<p>The servant&rsquo;s reversal of circumstances portends a reversal of circumstances for Jehovah&rsquo;s elect. As Jehovah empowers his servant, so the servant empowers them (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODg0NSI6NX0=\">Isaiah 61:1-5<\/a>). Both follow the same pattern of loyalty to Jehovah: &ldquo;Your faithfulness in time [of trial] shall prove to be a strength, your wisdom and knowledge your salvation&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4Mjg2XQ==\">Isaiah 33:6<\/a>). The &ldquo;favorable time&rdquo; in which Jehovah answers his servant&rsquo;s intercession on behalf of his people under the terms of the Davidic Covenant coincides with the &ldquo;day of salvation&rdquo;&mdash;Jehovah&rsquo;s Day of Judgment that precedes his coming to the earth.<\/p><p>Jehovah&rsquo;s &ldquo;creating&rdquo; or re-creating and &ldquo;appointing&rdquo; his servant as a <em>covenant<\/em> to his people (cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDg3XQ==\">Isaiah 42:6<\/a>) denotes his ascent to the seraph level and his role as mediator of Jehovah&rsquo;s covenant. After freeing the spiritual captives of Jehovah&rsquo;s people (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDg4XQ==\">Isaiah 42:7<\/a>)&mdash;those who were blind and deaf on account of their idolatries (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODQ5OCI6NH0=\">Isaiah 42:17-20<\/a>)&mdash;the servant frees them physically (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg2NjEiOjJ9LFsxODU3NV1d\">vv 24-25; Isaiah 45:13<\/a>). Those who were subject to physical <em>darkness<\/em>&mdash;to the king of Assyria\/Babylon&mdash;the servant appoints lands of inheritance as Jehovah&rsquo;s coming as <em>salvation<\/em> draws near (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NjQ1LDE4NzA0LDE4Nzk1LDE4Nzk5XQ==\">v 8; Isaiah 52:7; 58:8, 12<\/a>).<\/p>",
