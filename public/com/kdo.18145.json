They lift up the voice together; they rejoice: for they see eye to eye, how Jehovah bringeth Zion home.\u201d<\/em> \u05e7\u05d5\u05dc followed by a genitive formed an interjectional clause, and had almost become an interjection itself (see <a class=\"ref\">Genesis 4:10<\/a>). The prophets are here called <em> tso\u0304ph\u0131\u0304m <\/em> , spies, as persons who looked into the distance as if from a watch-tower (<em> specula <\/em> , <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MDQyLDIyNzUwXQ==\">Isaiah 21:6; Habakkuk 2:1<\/a>) just as in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzY0XQ==\">Isaiah 56:10<\/a>. It is assumed that the people of the captivity would still have prophets among them: in fact, the very first word in these prophecies (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDIyXQ==\">Isaiah 40:1<\/a>) is addressed to them. They who saw the redemption from afar, and comforted the church therewith (different from <em> m e bhasse\u0304r <\/em> , the evangelist of the fulfilment), lift up their voice together with rejoicing; for they see Jehovah bringing back Zion, as closely as one man is to another when he looks directly into his eyes (<a class=\"ref\">Numbers 14:14<\/a>). \u05d1\u05bc is the same as in the construction \u05d1\u05bc \u05e8\u05d0\u05d4 ; and \u05e9\u05c1\u05d5\u05bc\u05d1 has the transitive meaning <em> reducere <\/em> , <em> restituere <\/em> (as in <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 14:7; Psalms 126:1<\/a>, etc.), which is placed beyond all doubt by \u05e9\u05c1\u05d5\u05bc\u05d1\u05e0\u05d5\u05bc in <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 85:5<\/a>.<\/p>",
