    "html": " <p>The first and second gatherings of peoples to &ldquo;my holy mountain&rdquo; parallel each other in several respects. The first group&mdash;persons in the son\/servant category or Jehovah&rsquo;s elect (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODUxMSI6M30=\">Isaiah 43:5-7<\/a>; cf. <a class=\"ref\">Matthew 24:31<\/a>)&mdash;gathers in a new exodus led by Jehovah&rsquo;s servant and others on the seraph level when protected by Jehovah&rsquo;s presence (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODE2NV0seyIxODQ2MCI6Nn0seyIxODYzNSI6Mn0seyIxODY0NiI6NH0seyIxODY1OSI6Mn0seyIxODcwOCI6Mn0sWzE4Nzk1XV0=\">Isaiah 27:13; 41:8-13; 48:20-21; 49:9-12, 22-23; 52:11-12; 58:8<\/a>). The second group&mdash;those who &ldquo;survive&rdquo; Jehovah&rsquo;s Day of Judgment without his direct divine intervention&mdash;gathers to Jehovah&rsquo;s &ldquo;house&rdquo; or rebuilt temple after he has come to reign on the earth. <\/p> <p>Both gatherings follow the same pattern. On those who gather their &ldquo;brethren&rdquo; from dispersion Jehovah sets a &ldquo;mark&rdquo; that empowers them to protect those whom they gather. The type of such a mark occurs in an earlier Day of Judgment, when Jehovah put a mark on the foreheads of those who mourned for the wickedness of his people, which mark protected them from the Babylonians who slew them (<a class=\"ref\">Ezekiel 9:4-6<\/a>). The angel from the east in John&rsquo;s vision of Jehovah&rsquo;s Day of Judgment similarly seals 144,000 servants of God on their foreheads, assuring their divine protection (<a class=\"ref\">Revelation 7:3-8; 9:4; 14:1<\/a>). <\/p> <p>While John&rsquo;s angel from the east appears identical with Jehovah&rsquo;s servant from the east (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDU0LDE4NDc3LDE4NTk4XQ==\">Isaiah 41:2, 25; 46:11<\/a>), John&rsquo;s 144,000 servants appear identical with Jehovah&rsquo;s servants or watchmen on Isaiah&rsquo;s seraph level (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODkzNywxODg0N10seyIxODg1MCI6NX0sWzE4ODg0LDE4OTA2XV0=\">v 14; Isaiah 61:3, 6-10; 63:17; 65:8<\/a>). Those who gather the second group, on the other hand&mdash;after Jehovah has instituted his reign on the earth&mdash;appear to originate with the first group, the &ldquo;survivors&rdquo; or &ldquo;escapees&rdquo; (<em>peletim <\/em>) of Jehovah&rsquo;s Day of Judgment. They go forth and gather those who remain. The people whom they bring are <em>their <\/em> &ldquo;offerings&rdquo; to Jehovah (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzYxLDE4ODI5XQ==\">Isaiah 56:7; 60:7<\/a>). <\/p> ",
