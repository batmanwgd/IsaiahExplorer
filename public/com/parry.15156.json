She does not, however, bring forth a child but rather brings forth \"wind,\" perhaps symbolizing her destruction.<\/p> <p> Israel was responsible for bringing forth the fruit that the Lord intended, such as the gospel with its saving ordinances. She (Israel) did not provide that deliverance or life to the world (Isaiah says, \"We have not wrought any deliverance in the earth\"), neither have the inhabitants of the world \"fallen from the womb\" (Hebrew <i>napal<\/i>) or become born of God. Instead, Israel brought forth nothing but wind, and the pain associated with her delivery (such as God's chastisements, exile, etc.) was for naught.<\/p> ",
