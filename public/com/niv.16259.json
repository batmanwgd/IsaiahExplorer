    "html": "               <p>I<small>N THESE VERSES<\/small> God addresses the Servant in ways that are reminiscent of the dialogue in Psalm 2. God declares that although the Servant is \u201cdespised\u201d and reduced to the level of a slave, a day will come when kings and princes will honor him because of God\u2019s faithfulness in his life (49:7; cf. Phil. 2:5\u201311). In particular, the Servant\u2019s task is to be a representative of God\u2019s \u201ccovenant\u201d to his people. Like a new Joshua he will settle the people in a land of freedom and abundance, where the God of \u201ccompassion\u201d will tend them as a shepherd tends his flock (Isa. 49:8\u201311). While 49:12 may be intended to speak of the remnant returning from all directions, it may also be another indication of the worldwide scope of the Servant\u2019s ministry. People of all sorts from all kinds of places will find restoration to God through him.<\/p>     ",
