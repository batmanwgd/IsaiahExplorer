Both kinds appear in Isaiah&rsquo;s end-time scenario: (1) watchmen who see and hear and report it (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MDQ2LDE4NzA1LDE4ODYxXQ==\">v 10; Isaiah 52:8; 62:6 <\/a>); and (2) watchmen who are blind and unaware (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MjA0LDE4NzY0XQ==\">Isaiah 29:10; 56:10 <\/a>). Because the term &ldquo;watchman&rdquo; designates a prophet (<a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 31:6; Ezekiel 3:17 <\/a>), Jehovah&rsquo;s appointing a prophet who warns of Babylon&rsquo;s imminent destruction forms the type of his end-time servant who serves as a watchman to Jehovah&rsquo;s people (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDc5LDE4NjMxLDE4NzQ1XQ==\">Isaiah 41:27; 48:16; 55:4 <\/a>). <\/p> ",
