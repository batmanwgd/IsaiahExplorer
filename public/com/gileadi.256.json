    "html": "<p>The prophet&rsquo;s appointing a &ldquo;watchman&rdquo; who reports what he sees implies that some watchmen don&rsquo;t report what they see, or don&rsquo;t see at all. Both kinds appear in Isaiah&rsquo;s end-time scenario: (1) watchmen who see and hear and report it (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc5ODAiOjF9LHsiMTg3MDUiOjF9LHsiMTg4NjEiOjF9XQ==\">v 10; Isaiah 52:8; 62:6<\/a>); and (2) watchmen who are blind and unaware (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgyMDQiOjF9LHsiMTg3NjQiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 29:10; 56:10<\/a>). Because the term &ldquo;watchman&rdquo; designates a prophet (<a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 31:6; Ezekiel 3:17<\/a>), Jehovah&rsquo;s appointing a prophet who warns of Babylon&rsquo;s imminent destruction forms the type of his end-time servant who serves as a watchman to Jehovah&rsquo;s people (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg0NzkiOjF9LHsiMTg2MzEiOjF9LHsiMTg3NDUiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 41:27; 48:16; 55:4<\/a>).<\/p>",
