(<a class=\"ref\">John 1:14<\/a>.)<\/p>\n <p>All flesh.\u2014The revelation is not for Israel only, but for mankind. So in <a class=\"ref\">Luke 3:6<\/a>, the words are quoted from the LXX., \u201call flesh shall see the salvation of God.\u201d The phrase meets us here for the first time, and occurs again in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTg2NjM=\">Isaiah 49:26<\/a>; <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTg5Mzk=\">Isaiah 66:16<\/a>; <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODk0NiI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 66:23-24<\/a>, marking, so to speak, the growing catholicity of the prophet\u2019s thoughts. (See Note on <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTg0MDI=\">Isaiah 38:11<\/a>.)<\/p>",
