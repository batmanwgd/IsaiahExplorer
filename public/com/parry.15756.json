    "html": " <p> <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isa. 53<\/a> is often called the \"Song of the Suffering Servant.\" Both Abinadi and Philip clearly tell us that the servant described here is Jesus Christ (<a class=\"ref\">Mosiah 15; Acts 8:26-35<\/a>). Matthew, Peter, and Paul also understood that at least parts of this chapter referred to Jesus (<a class=\"ref\">Matt. 8:17; 1 Pet. 2:24-25<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\">Rom. 4:25<\/a>). The headnote to <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isa. 53<\/a> in the LDS edition of the Bible says, \"Isaiah speaks Messianically\u2014Messiah's humiliation and sufferings set forth\u2014He makes his soul an offering for sin and makes intercession for transgressors.\" This passage has four recurring themes: the Messiah's sufferings, his assumption of our burdens and our sins, his death, and his reward.<\/p> <p> First, the Messiah's sufferings: \"He is despised and rejected of men\" (53:3). \"He is&hellip;a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief\" (53:3). \"He was despised, and we esteemed him not\" (53:3). \"We did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted\" (53:4). \"He was wounded [and] bruised\" (53:5). \"He was oppressed, and he was afflicted\" (53:7). \"It pleased the Lord to bruise him; he hath put him to grief\" (53:10). \"He shall see the travail of his soul\" (53:11).<\/p> <p>Second, his assumption of our burdens and sins: \"He hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows\" (53:4). \"He was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities\" (53:5). \"The Lord hath laid on him the iniquities of us all\" (53:6). \"For the transgressions of my people was he stricken\" (53:8). \"He shall bear their iniquities\" (53:11). \"He bare the sin of many\" (53:12).<\/p> <p>Third, his death: \"He is brought as a lamb to the slaughter\" (53:7). \"He was cut off out of the land of the living\" (53:8). \"He made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death\" (53:9). \"He hath poured out his soul unto death\" (53:12).<\/p> <p>Fourth, his reward: \"He shall see his seed\" (53:10). \"He shall prolong his days\" (53:10). \"The pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand\" (53:10). \"He&hellip;shall be satisfied\" (53:11). \"Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great\" (53:12). \"He shall divide the spoil with the strong\" (53:12).<\/p> <blockquote> <i>Who<\/i> hath <u>believed<\/u> our report?     <br>and <i>to whom<\/i> is the arm of the Lord <u>revealed<\/u>?
