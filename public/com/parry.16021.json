Fire and flames<i> <\/i>of<i> <\/i>fire also symbolize God's glory and unapproachable holiness (30:27; <a class=\"ref\">Ex. 3:2<\/a>). Chariots and the whirlwind symbolize God's power in bringing justice; the whirlwind also suggests the swiftness with which the Lord comes to destroy the wicked (19:1; <a class=\"ref\">Jer. 4:13; Ps. 104:3<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\">Abr. 2:7<\/a>). <\/p> <p> <i>anger\/fury\/rebuke.<\/i> The Lord has reached out to the wicked in long-suffering and patience for many generations.
