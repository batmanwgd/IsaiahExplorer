    "html": " <p>In these verses one can see a good example of dualism (see Enrichment E). Isaiah shows that the wickedness prevailing in Israel and Judah included the women, who were proud, arrogant, and more concerned with their clothing, jewels, and personal appearance than with righteousness. But these verses can also be applied in the latter days, when women will once more lose sight of proper priorities. President Joseph Fielding Smith said of this passage: <\/p> <p>&ldquo;Isaiah, one of the great prophets of early times, saw our day, and he described the conditions that would prevail among the &lsquo;daughters of Zion&rsquo; in these latter days. &hellip; <\/p> <p>&ldquo;Now, in this modern day, Isaiah&rsquo;s prophecy has been and is being fulfilled. &hellip; <\/p> <p>&ldquo;The standards expressed by the General Authorities of the Church are that women, as well as men, should dress modestly. They are taught proper deportment and modesty at all times. It is, in my judgment, a sad reflection on the &lsquo;daughters of Zion&rsquo; when they dress immodestly. Moreover, this remark pertains to the men as well as to the women. The Lord gave commandments to ancient Israel that both men and women should cover their bodies and observe the law of chastity at all times.&rdquo; (<em>Answers to Gospel Questions, <\/em> 5:172&ndash;74.) <\/p> <p class=\"cite\"> LDS Church Educational System Old Testament Student Manual, 1 Kings&ndash;Malachi, Religion 302, Chapter 13, Item 20 <\/p> ",
