The New English Bible may help clarify the meaning of this verse when it says,[\"[they] shall receive from me something better than sons and daughters,&hellip;I will give them an everlasting name, a name imperishable for all time.\" The name may be the new name given to those who are exalted (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 130:11<\/a>), or it may be the name that King Benjamin gave to his people, which \"never should be blotted out\" (<a class=\"ref\">Mosiah 5:11<\/a>)\u2014that is, the name of Christ. Compare this usage of \"everlasting name, that shall not be cut off\" with the usage in 55:13.<\/p> ",
