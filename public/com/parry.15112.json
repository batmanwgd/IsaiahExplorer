We are the remnant that is being gathered from the nations. According to Isaiah, we are[\"lift[ing our] voice,\"[\"cry[ing] aloud for the majesty of the Lord,\" sharing the gospel message from Zion (\"the region of light\"), and glorifying his name throughout the entire world.<\/p> <blockquote>When thus it shall be <i>in the midst of the land<\/i>     <br><i>among the people<\/i>,     <br>there shall be as [<u>when an olive tree is beaten<\/u>,     <br>or as <u>when gleanings are left over after the grape harvest<\/u>] is done. (24:13)     <br><i>They<\/i> shall <u>lift up their voice<\/u>,     <br><i>they <\/i>shall [<u>cry aloud<\/u>] for the majesty of the Lord,     <br><i>they<\/i> shall [<u>cry shrilly<\/u>] from the sea. (24:14)     <br>Wherefore <i>glorify ye the Lord<\/i> <u>in the [region of light<\/u>],     <br><i>even the name of the Lord God of Israel <\/i><u>in the isles of the sea<\/u>. (24:15)     <br>From the <u>uttermost part of the earth<\/u> have we heard songs, even [<i>'Glory to the righteous one'<\/i>]. (24:16a)<\/blockquote> ",
