Its interpretation is given to us in the Book of Mormon, and the time of its fulfillment is provided in the Doctrine and Covenants. The wicked priests of King Noah asked the prophet Abinadi what <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODcwNCI6NH0=\">Isaiah 52:7-10<\/a> meant (see <a class=\"ref\">Mosiah 12:20-24<\/a>). In a delayed response, Abinadi identified Christ as the \"founder of peace\" and all those who declare the message of the gospel as the publishers of peace (see <a class=\"ref\">Mosiah 15:13-18<\/a>). Paul bore the same testimony to the Romans concerning those who preach the gospel (see <a class=\"ref\">Rom. 10:14-15<\/a>). In the Doctrine and Covenants, the Lord quoted the words of verse 7 in sending out modern-day priesthood holders to do missionary work (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 19:29; 31:3; 79:1<\/a>). The Savior also cited this verse as the response of those who come to knew his name and his revelations, as described in verse 6-indicating that it is the message of the gospel which will bring his people to that knowledge (see <a class=\"ref\">3 Ne. 20:39-40<\/a>).<\/p>     ",
