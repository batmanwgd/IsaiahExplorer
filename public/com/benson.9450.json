But this rendering,<i> shall go forth of thee,<\/i> says Bishop Lowth, \u201cis very flat, after their zeal had been expressed by their being her<i> builders:<\/i> and as the opposition is kept up in one part of the sentence, one has reason to expect it in the other.\u201d He, therefore, renders<span class=\"hebrew_text\"> \u05de\u05de\u05df \u05d9\u05e6\u05d0\u05d5<\/span> ,<i> shall proceed, spring,<\/i> or<i> issue, from thee;<\/i> namely, as thy children, and reads the whole verse thus:<i> They that destroy thee shall soon become thy builders; and they that laid thee waste shall become thine offspring:<\/i> the accession of the Gentiles to the church of God being properly considered as an addition made to the number of the family and children of Zion.<\/p> ",
