    "html": "<p>The archtyrant&rsquo;s &ldquo;glory&rdquo;&mdash;his personality cult of ceremony, music, pageantry, and propaganda&mdash;comes to an end when he does. Like a common mortal, he who ruled the world, who inspired fear in men&rsquo;s hearts, goes the way of all flesh, his body consumed by maggots and worms. With his passing, a millennial age of peace begins for surviving humanity: &ldquo;Tyranny shall no more be heard of in your land, nor dispossession or disaster within your borders&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTg4NDA=\">Isaiah 60:18<\/a>); &ldquo;The insolent people are not to be seen, a nation of incomprehensible speech, whose babbling tongue was unintelligible&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTgyOTk=\">Isaiah 33:19<\/a>).<\/p>",
