    "html": "<p> (17) One thousand shall flee at the rebuke of one.\u2014The hyperbole is natural and common enough ( <a class=\"ref\">Deuteronomy 32:30; Joshua 23:10; Leviticus 26:8<\/a>); but the fact that the inscription of King Piankhi Mer. Amon., translated in Records of the Past, ii. 84, gives it in the self-same words (\u201cmany shall turn their backs on a few; and one shall rout a thousand\u201d) as his boast of the strength of Egypt, may have given a special touch of sarcasm to Isaiah\u2019s words.<\/p> \n<p>As a beacon upon the top of a mountain.\u2014Literally, as a pine. As with a poet\u2019s eye, the prophet paints two of the most striking emblems of solitariness: the tall pine standing by itself on the mountain height, the flag-staff seen alone far off against the sky. (Comp. the lowlier imagery of <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NjYzXQ==\">Isaiah 1:8<\/a>.)<\/p> ",
