    "html": "<p><em>For my sword shall be bathed in heaven \"For my sword is made bare in the heavens\"\u2014<\/em>There seems to be some impropriety in this, according to the present reading: \"My sword is made drunken, or is bathed in the heavens; \"which forestalls, and expresses not in its proper place, what belongs to the next verse: for the sword of Jehovah was not to be bathed or glutted with blood in the heavens, but in Botsra and the land of Edom. In the heavens it was only prepared for slaughter. To remedy this, Archbishop Secker proposes to read, for <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d1\u05e9\u05de\u05d9\u05dd <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">bashshamayim<\/span>, <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d1\u05d3\u05de\u05dd <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">bedamim<\/span> ; referring to  <a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 46:10<\/a>. But even this is premature, and not in its proper place. The Chaldee, for <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea\u05d4 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">rivvethah<\/span>, has <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05ea\u05ea\u05d2\u05dc\u05d9 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">tithgalli<\/span>, shall be revealed or disclosed: perhaps he read <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05ea\u05e8\u05d0\u05d4 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">teraeh<\/span>  or <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05e0\u05e8\u05d0\u05ea\u05d4 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">nirathah<\/span> . Whatever reading, different I presume from the present, he might find in his copy, I follow the sense which he has given of it.<\/p>",
