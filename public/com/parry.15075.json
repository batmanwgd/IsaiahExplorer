One possible meaning: the nail prints will remain in Christ's body even after the resurrection, until every person has witnessed them, acknowledged that he is the Savior, and accepted judgment. All persons will be judged in proportion to their acceptance of him and his tokens. This passage, then, may refer to the completion of Jesus Christ's divine work and the judgments against the wicked, when justice has been eternally served.<\/p> <p><i>Lord hath spoken it.<\/i> The Lord is the source of Isaiah's prophecy.<\/p> ",
