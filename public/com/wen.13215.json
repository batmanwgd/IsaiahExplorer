Set up\u2014Those monuments which thou didst set up there as remembrances of those idol\u2014gods whom they represented. Discovered\u2014Thou hast uncovered thy nakedness; to others beside me thine husband. Gone up\u2014Into the adulterous bed. Enlarged\u2014That it might receive many adulterers together. Thou hast multiplied thine idols and altars. A covenant\u2014Thou hast covenanted to serve them.",
