    "html": "<p>This chapter of Isaiah's writings is particularly significant, as evidenced by the fact that it is referenced in all four of the Standard Works the Church accepts as scripture. In addition to the Old Testament and Book of Mormon accounts, portions of these writings are found in the New Testament (<a class=\"ref\">Revelation 2:16; 5:5; 19:15<\/a>; and <a class=\"ref\">Romans 15:12<\/a>) and the Doctrine &amp; Covenants (19:15; 113:1-6; and 133:26-29); and in Joseph Smith's history as found in the Pearl of Great Price, he tells us that the entire chapter of <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODk2XQ==\">Isaiah 11<\/a> was quoted to him by the Angel Moroni (JS H 1:40). Additionally, on several occasions the Prophet provided commentary on verses in this chapter. (See TPJS, 14-15, 71, 93, 316.)<\/p>     <p>Isaiah's vision included a look at the latter days in which we live, as well as a view of millennial conditions. In fact, when Moroni appeared to young Joseph Smith on the night of 21 September 1823, he informed him that these particular writings of Isaiah were \"about to be fulfilled.\" Isaiah obviously knew about the great work to be accomplished by the Lord through His servants in this last dispensation of time.<\/p>",
