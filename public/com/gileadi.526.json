    "html": "<p>When God created the heavens and the earth, &ldquo;the earth was without form and void, and darkness was over the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved over the face of the waters, and God said, &lsquo;Let there be light!&rsquo; And there was light. And God saw the light, that it was good. And God divided the light from the darkness&rdquo; (<a class=\"ref\">Genesis 1:2-4<\/a>). That division of the light from the darkness&mdash;representing a new creation out of chaotic matter&mdash;became an allegory of the spiritual light and darkness that serve as a test for humanity to see which of the two people will choose (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxNzc2MCwxODc5N10seyIxODgyMyI6Mn1d\">Isaiah 5:20; 58:10; 60:1-2<\/a>).<\/p><p>Secondarily, Jehovah appoints his servant as a <em>light<\/em> to the nations (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDg3LDE4NjQzXQ==\">Isaiah 42:6; 49:6<\/a>; cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NjczLDE4ODU2XQ==\">50:10; 62:1<\/a>), while the king of Assyria\/Babylon typifies the <em>darkness<\/em> from which the servant delivers them (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg0ODciOjJ9LFsxODY0Nl1d\">Isaiah 42:6-7; 49:9<\/a>; cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODMyLDE4MjEyXQ==\">9:2; 29:18<\/a>). Similarly, &ldquo;calamity,&rdquo; &ldquo;disaster,&rdquo; or &ldquo;evil&rdquo; (<em>ra&lsquo;<\/em>) signifies the covenant curse most often associated with the archtyrant (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzE3LDE3NzE5LDE3OTE4LDE4MjUzXQ==\">Isaiah 3:9, 11; 13:11; 31:2<\/a>), while he who begets &ldquo;peace&rdquo; is Israel&rsquo;s God Jehovah (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzE3XQ==\">Isaiah 53:5<\/a>; cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTM0LDE4MTQzLDE4NzA0XQ==\">26:3, 12; 52:7<\/a>). Although Jehovah &ldquo;does all these things,&rdquo; people nevertheless experience them as a consequence of their righteousness or wickedness.<\/p>",
