The Ephraimites are reproved and threatened for their pride and  drunkenness, their security and sensuality,   <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 28:1-8<\/a>.  But, in the midst of this, here is a gracious promise of God's favour  to the remnant of his people,   <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 28:5<\/a>.  II. They are likewise reproved and threatened for their dulness and  stupidity, and unaptness to profit by the instructions which the  prophets gave them in God's name,   <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 28:9-13<\/a>.  III. The rulers of Jerusalem are reproved and threatened for their  insolent contempt of God's judgments, and setting them at defiance  and, after a gracious promise of Christ and his grace, they are made to  know that the vain hopes of escaping the judgments of God with which  they flattered themselves would certainly deceive them,   <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 28:14-22<\/a>.

This is written for our admonition, and is profitable for reproof and  warning to us.<\/p>",
