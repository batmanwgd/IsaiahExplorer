Those who gained immense wealth by trading on the high seas, who lived like kings among the nations of the world, Jehovah humiliates for their godless conceit. Those who considered themselves above others, who took pride in their prestige and preeminence, he renders profane: &ldquo;The haughty eyes of men shall be lowered and man&rsquo;s pride abased; Jehovah alone shall be exalted in that day&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3Njk3XQ==\">Isaiah 2:11<\/a>). <\/p> ",
