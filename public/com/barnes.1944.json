The same persons, however, are intended. <\/p> <p> <em>In their portion <\/em>&mdash;That is, you shall be permitted to rejoice in the augmented privileges which you shall enjoy. They will be more than a compensation for all the calamities which you have been called to endure. <\/p> <p> <em>Therefore in their land <\/em>&mdash;This is to be regarded as addressed to the exiles in Babylon, and the promise is, that the people of God would be restored again to their own land, and to more than their former privileges and blessings there. <\/p> <p> <em>The double <\/em>&mdash;Double of what they formerly possessed; that is, their blessings would be greatly increased and multiplied. Applied to the times of the Messiah, to which the prophet undoubtedly refers, it means that the privileges of the friends of God would be far greater than had been enjoyed even in the most favored times under the former dispensation. <\/p> <p> <em>Everlasting joy <\/em>&mdash;(See the notes at <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MzMxXQ==\">Isaiah 35:10 <\/a>). <\/p> ",
