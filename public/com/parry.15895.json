In the April 1964 general conference, Elder John Longdon said, \"Is the airplane flying in the skies from one country to another a sign? The heavens are filled with them, and people are fulfilling the prophecy of <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODMwXQ==\">Isa. 60:8<\/a>.\" Another interpretation may be that the people who \"flock in\" from over the sea to Zion travel as easily as a cloud travels through the sky, and they are so sure of their destination that they are like doves returning to their cotes.<\/p> ",
