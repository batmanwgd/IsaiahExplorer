    "html": "<p align=\"center\" class=\"subtitle\"> VI.<\/p> \n<p>(1) In the year that king Uzziah died.\u2014Probably before his death. Had it been after it, the first year of king Jotham would have been the more natural formula. The chapter gives us the narrative of the solemn call of Isaiah to the office of a prophet. It does not follow that it was written at that time, and we may even believe that, if the prophet were the editor of his own discourses, he may have designedly placed the narrative in this position that men might see what he himself saw, that all that was found in the preceding chapters was but the development of what he had then heard, and yet, at the same time, a representation of the evils which made the judgments he was commissioned to declare necessary. On the relation of the call to the prophet\u2019s previous life, see Introduction.<\/p> \n<p>The date is obviously given as important, and we are led to connect it with the crisis in the prophet\u2019s life of which it tells. He had lived through the last twenty years or so of Uzziah\u2019s reign. There was the show of outward material prosperity. There was the reality of much inward corruption. The king who had profaned the holiness of the Temple had either just died or was dragging out the dregs of his leprous life in seclusion ( <a class=\"ref\">2 Chronicles 26:21<\/a>). The question, What was to be the future of his people? must have been much in the prophet\u2019s thoughts. The earthquake that had terrified Jerusalem had left on his mind a vague sense of impending judgment. It is significant that Isaiah\u2019s first work as a writer was to write the history of Uzziah\u2019s reign ( <a class=\"ref\">2 Chronicles 26:22<\/a>). (See Introduction.)<\/p> \n<p>I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne.\u2014Isaiah had found himself in \u2018the court of the Temple, probably in that of the priests. He had seen the incense-clouds rising from the censer of the priest, and had heard the hymns and hallelujahs of the Levites. Suddenly he passes, as St. Paul afterwards passed, under the influence of like surroundings ( <a class=\"ref\">Acts 22:17<\/a>), into a state of ecstatic trance, and as though the veil of the Temple was withdrawn, he saw the vision of the glory of the Lord, as Moses ( <a class=\"ref\">Exodus 24:10<\/a>) and Micaiah of old had seen it ( <a class=\"ref\">1 Kings 22:19<\/a>), as in more recent times it had appeared to Amos (9:1). The King of kings was seated on His throne, and on the right hand and on the left were the angel-armies of the host of heaven, chanting their hymns of praise.<\/p> \n<p>His train filled the temple.\u2014The word for \u201ctemple\u201d is that which expresses its character as the palace of the great King. (Comp. <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 11:4; Psalms 29:9; Habakkuk 2:20<\/a>.) The \u201ctrain\u201d answers to the skirts of the glory of the Lord, who clothes Himself with light as with a garment ( <a class=\"ref\">Exodus 33:22-23<\/a>). It is noticeable (1) that the versions (LXX., Targum, Vulg.) suppress the train, apparently as being too anthropomorphic, and (2) that to the mind of St. John this was a vision of the glory of the Christ ( <a class=\"ref\">John 12:41<\/a>).<\/p> ",
