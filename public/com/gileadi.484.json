    "html": "<p>Although Jehovah may &ldquo;go like a lamb to the slaughter&rdquo; ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzE5XQ==\">Isaiah 53:7<\/a>), when the need arises he is no pacifist. Should circumstances demand it when his covenants are honored&mdash;as when enemies threaten those who keep his law and word&mdash;Jehovah intervenes and comes to their aid. His role of divine emperor requires him to deliver a loyal vassal who faces a mortal threat. Those are the conditions Jehovah&rsquo;s people face at the time his servant fulfills his mission. Anyone who assumes that Israel&rsquo;s God won&rsquo;t intervene on his people&rsquo;s behalf because he hasn&rsquo;t done so for a long time will be sadly mistaken.<\/p><p>Jehovah&rsquo;s identifying himself with &ldquo;a woman in labor&rdquo; alludes to the rebirth of his people to higher spiritual categories, as when &ldquo;Zion gives birth to her children&rdquo; when world events come to a head ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODkzMSI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 66:8-9<\/a>). Because Israel&rsquo;s deliverance from the Philistines wasn&rsquo;t complete until David had subdued them ( <a class=\"ref\">2 Samuel 3:18<\/a>), so the end-time deliverance of Jehovah&rsquo;s people isn&rsquo;t complete until their enemies perish. While in Jehovah&rsquo;s Day of Judgment both the archtyrant and natural disasters reduce much of the earth&rsquo;s terrain to chaos, Jehovah&rsquo;s &ldquo;enemies&rdquo; are represented metaphorically by that same terrain.<\/p> ",
