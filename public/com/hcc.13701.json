(Challoner) --- 4 Kings xviii. 3., and Romans ix. 27.  The apostle follows the Septuagint, (Calmet) \"and if the people of Israel be.\" --- <i>Converted.<\/i>  Septuagint, \"saved, for perfecting the word and abridging in justice.  Because God, the Lord of hosts, will make an abridged word in the universe.\"  (Haydock) --- As the apostle has explained this passage, \"every other interpretation must cease.\"  (St. Jerome) --- The few who were converted under Ezechias were a figure of those who should embrace the faith of Christ.  (Calmet) --- <i>Consumption.<\/i>  That is, the <i>number of them cut short, and reduced to few,<\/i> shall flourish in the abundance of justice.  (Challoner) --- Hebrew, \"the desolation is decreed, justice shall overflow.\"  God will treat all with rigour, Nahum i. 8.  The incredulous Jews shall be rejected, ver. 23., and Romans ix.<\/p>",
