    "html": " <i>hell hath enlarged herself. <\/i>The<i> <\/i>term <i>hell<\/i> (Hebrew <i>sheol)<\/i> in this verse refers to the world of spirits. Hell opens her mouth wide enough to receive all who are pompous and wicked, as well as their pomp and glory; both the wicked <i>and<\/i> their evil traits will be cast down to hell. This \"opened mouth\" image that is connected to hell continues the symbolism of feasting (\"strong drink,\" \"wine,\" \"feasts\") and famine (\"famished,\" \"dried up with thirst\"). The wicked open their mouths as they eat, drink, and are merry, while at the same time hell opens <i>her<\/i> mouth to swallow <i>them.<\/i> In the end, hell's mouth, not the mouths of the wicked, will be filled.<\/p> ",
