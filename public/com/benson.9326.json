Spiritual blessings are often set forth under the emblems of fruitfulness and plenty, as the reader may see, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzM2XQ==\">Isaiah 4:2<\/a>; <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MjQxXQ==\">Isaiah 30:23<\/a>; <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4Mjc1XQ==\">Isaiah 32:15<\/a>, and elsewhere. <i>The glory of Lebanon shall be given unto it,<\/i>,&c.\u2014The prophet goes on to express the great change which should be made in the Gentile world by the gospel. For Lebanon was a mountain famous for its excellent cedars, Carmel was a most delightful woody mountain, and Sharon a most pleasant place for pasture; so that all these added together express great excellence: as if he had said, Whatever was valuable and desirable in the Mosaic economy shall be translated into, and appear in perfection in, the gospel of Christ; and the Gentile world, formerly a wilderness, shall be as much enriched with spiritual blessings, and be as fruitful in all the graces and virtues which belong to true and genuine religion, as ever Judea was, and abundantly more. <i>They <\/i>\u2014Who formerly were in the wilderness of heathenism; <i>shall see the glory of the Lord <\/i>\u2014The glorious discoveries and effects of God\u2019s power and goodness to his people. <\/p>",
