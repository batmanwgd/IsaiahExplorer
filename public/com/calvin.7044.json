Babylon employed not only her own soldiers, but likewise foreign and hired soldiers. He says that they will all be like <i>roes<\/i>, which are timorous creatures, and like scattered <i>sheep<\/i>, so that they will neither repair to their <i>standards<\/i>, or their <i>post<\/i>, nor preserve any order. <\/p>\n <p> <i>Every one to his own land.<\/i>, Hence it is easily seen that the Prophet speaks, not only of the natives, or even of the strangers who had formerly dwelt there, but of foreigners who had been brought for the protection of the city. We have formerly said that the hearts of men are in the hand of God in such a manner that, according to his pleasure, either those who formerly were timid or cowardly persons suddenly acquire fresh courage, or those who formerly boasted loudly of being bold and daring lose their fierceness and become effeminate. <\/p>",
