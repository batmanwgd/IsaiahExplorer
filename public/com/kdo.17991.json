    "html": "<p> The prospect is now mercifully changed. <em> \u201cAnd it came to pass <\/em> (K. <em> Isaiah was not yet out of the inner city;<\/em> keri \u05e1\u05d4\u05e6\u05e8 ,<em> the forecourt, and<\/em> )<em> the word of Jehovah came to Isaiah <\/em> (K.<em> to him) as follows: Go <\/em> (K.<em> turn again) and say to Hizkiyahu <\/em> (K. adds,<em> to the prince of my people<\/em> ),<em> Thus saith Jehovah, the God of David thine ancestor, I have heard thy prayer, seen thy tears; behold, I <\/em> (K.<em> will cure thee, on the third day thou shalt go up to the house of Jehovah<\/em> )<em> add <\/em> (K.<em> and I add) to thy days fifteen years. And I will deliver thee ad this city out of the hand of the king of Asshur, and will defend this city <\/em> (K.<em> for mine own sake and for David my servant's sake<\/em> )<em> .\u201d<\/em> In the place of \u05d4\u05e2\u05d9\u05e8 (the city) the <em> keri<\/em> and the earlier translators have \u05d4\u05e6\u05e8 . The city of David is not called the \u201cinner city\u201d anywhere else; in fact, Zion, with the temple hill, formed the upper city, so that apparently it is the inner space of the city of David that is here referred to, and Isaiah had not yet passed through the middle gate to return to the lower city, where he dwelt. The text of Kings is the more authentic throughout; except that \u05e2\u05de\u05bc\u05d9 \u05e0\u05d2\u05d9\u05d3 , \u201cthe prince of my people,\u201d is an annalistic adorning which is hardly original. \u05e1\u05d4\u05dc\u05d5 \u05da in Isaiah is an inf. abs. used in an imperative sense; \u05e9\u05c1\u05d5\u05bc\u05d1 , on the other hand, which we find in the other text, is imperative. On <em> yo\u0304siph <\/em> , see at <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MjA4XQ==\">Isaiah 29:14<\/a>. <\/p>",
