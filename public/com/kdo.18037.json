    "html": "<p> With the exclamation <em> he\u0304n <\/em> (behold) the eyes of Israel are now directed to the saving interposition of Jehovah in the immediate future. <em> \u201cBehold, all they that were incensed against thee must be ashamed and confounded; the men of thy conflict become as nothing, and perish. Thou wilt seek them, and not find them, the men of thy feuds; the men of thy warfare become as nothing, and nonentity. For I, Jehovah thy God, lay hold of thy right hand, He who saith to thee, Fear not; I will help thee.\u201d<\/em> The comprehensive expression <em> omnes inflammati in te <\/em> (<em> niphal<\/em> , as in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NTg2XQ==\">Isaiah 45:24<\/a>) stands at the head; and then, in order that every kind may be included, the enemies are called by a different name every time. The three substantives bear much the same relation to one another as <em> lis <\/em> , <em> rixa <\/em> , <em> bellum <\/em> (<em> m ilcha\u0302ma\u0302h <\/em> , lit., throng = war-tumult, like the epic \u03ba\u03bb\u03bf\u0301\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 ), hence <em> adversarii <\/em> , <em> inimici <\/em> , <em> hostes <\/em> . The suffixes have the force of objective genitives. We have founded our translation upon the reading \u05de\u05e6\u05bc\u05d5\u05bc\u05ea\u05d9 \u05da . The three names of the enemies are placed emphatically at the close of the sentences, and these are long drawn out, whilst the indignation gives vent to itself; whereas in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDY1XQ==\">Isaiah 41:13<\/a> there follows nothing but short sentences, in which the persecuted church is encouraged and affectionately embraced. Two clauses, which are made to rhyme with <em> e\u0304m <\/em> , announce the utter destruction of their foes; then the inflective rhyme <em> ekha <\/em> is repeated five times; and the sixth time it passes over into <em> \u0131\u0304kha <\/em> .<\/p>",
