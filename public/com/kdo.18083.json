    "html": "<p> There is already good ground, therefore, for exuberant rejoicing; and the reply of the church to these words of divine consolation is as follows: <em> \u201cExult, O heavens; for Jehovah hath accomplished it: shout, ye depths of the earth; break out, ye mountains, into exulting; thou forest, and all the wood therein: for Jehovah hath redeemed Jacob, and He showeth Himself glorious upon Israel.\u201d<\/em> All creation is to rejoice in the fact that Jehovah has completed what He purposed, that He has redeemed His people, and henceforth will show Himself glorious in them. The heavens on high are to exult; also the depths of the earth, i.e., not Hades, which would be opposed to the prevailing view of the Old Testament (Ps 66, cf., <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 88:13<\/a>), but the interior of the earth, with its caves, its pits, and its deep abysses (see <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 139:15<\/a>); and the mountains and woods which rise up from the earth towards heaven - all are to unite in the exultation of the redeemed: for the redemption that is being accomplished in man will extend its effects in all directions, even to the utmost limits of the natural world. <\/p><p> This exulting finale is a safe boundary-stone of this fifth prophecy. It opened with \u201cThus saith the Lord,\u201d and the sixth opens with the same.<\/p>",
