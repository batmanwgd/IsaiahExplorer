Day by day would come the dread rumours of the Assyrian march. Then the \u201creport\u201d would no longer be unintelligible. Instead of the \u201cline upon line, precept upon precept,\u201d there would be \u201cmourning upon mourning,\u201d \u201cday and night,\u201d each with its sad burden of alarming tidings. To understand those tidings would be a vexation and a terror. The word for \u201creport\u201d is the same as the \u201cdoctrine\u201d of <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 28:9<\/a>, and stands, in each case, for the deride \u201cmessage\u201d of the prophet.<\/p>",
