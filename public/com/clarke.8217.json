    "html": "<p><em>The girdle \"The cincture\"\u2014<\/em>All the ancient Versions, except that of Symmachus, have two different words for girdle in the two hemistichs. It is not probable that Isaiah would have repeated <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d0\u05d6\u05d5\u05e8 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">azer<\/span>, when a synonymous word so obvious as <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d7\u05d2\u05d5\u05e8 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">chagor<\/span>  occurred. The tautology seems to have arisen from the mistake of some transcriber. The meaning of this verse is, that a zeal for justice and truth shall make him active and strong in executing the great work which he shall undertake. See note on  <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 5:27<\/a>.<\/p>",
