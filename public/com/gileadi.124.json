    "html": "<p>Isaiah portrays Assyria&rsquo;s invasion of the land of Immanuel as a new Flood. His prophecy is fulfilled in the days of King Hezekiah&mdash;the prophesied Immanuel&mdash;when an army of a hundred-and-eighty-five thousand Assyrians besieges Jerusalem after Assyria has &ldquo;destroyed all peoples and their lands&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgzMzIiOjJ9LHsiMTgzNzEiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 36:1-2; 37:18<\/a>). The &ldquo;neck&rdquo; leaves the head&mdash;Zion\/Jerusalem&mdash;where a remnant of Jehovah&rsquo;s people awaits deliverance (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgzNzUiOjE1fV0=\">Isaiah 37:22-36<\/a>; cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc2NjIiOjN9XQ==\">1:7-9<\/a>). In an end-time context, Hezekiah serves as a type of Jehovah&rsquo;s servant, while the archtyrant&rsquo;s &ldquo;outspread wings&rdquo; may allude to modern warfare.<\/p>",
