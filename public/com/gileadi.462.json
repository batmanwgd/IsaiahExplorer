    "html": "<p>Opposition against Jehovah and his people finally causes Israel&rsquo;s God to intervene in humanity&rsquo;s affairs by calling the nations of the world to &ldquo;trial&rdquo; or &ldquo;justice&rdquo; (<em>mispat<\/em>). That situation arises because of the nations&rsquo; idolatry that blinds their minds and hardens their hearts against the truth, to which condition even Jehovah&rsquo;s people have succumbed (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 42:17-20; 44:9-21; 46:3-8<\/a>). Jehovah intervenes by raising up his servant, who appears in Part III of Isaiah&rsquo;s Seven-Part Structure (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODQ2NF0seyIxODQ1MyI6MTQ4fV0=\">Isaiah 9-12; 41-46<\/a>) under different personas that express different ministering roles he fulfills, temporal and spiritual.<\/p>",
