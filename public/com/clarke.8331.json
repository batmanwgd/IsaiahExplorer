Of the different ways of threshing in use among the Hebrews, and the manner of performing them, see the note on <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTkyXQ==\">Isaiah 28:27 <\/a>; (note). <\/p> \n\n <p>Our translators have taken the liberty of using the word threshing in a passive sense, to express the object or matter that is threshed; in which I have followed them, not being able to express it more properly, without departing too much from the form and letter of the original. \"Son of my floor,\" Hebrews It is an idiom of the Hebrew language to call the effect, the object, the adjunct, any thing that belongs in almost any way to another, the son of it. \"O my threshing.\" The prophet abruptly breaks off the speech of God; and instead of continuing it in the form in which he had begun, and in the person of God, \"This I declare unto you by my prophet,\" he changes the form of address, and adds, in his own person, \"This I declare unto you from God.\" <\/p> ",
