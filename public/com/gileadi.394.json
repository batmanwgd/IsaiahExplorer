    "html": "<p>Jehovah&rsquo;s &ldquo;day of vengeance&rdquo; and &ldquo;year of retribution&rdquo; on behalf of Zion&mdash;his Day of Judgment&mdash;occur as a covenant curse upon the wicked who violate the rights of his elect: &ldquo;I had resolved on a day of vengeance, and the year of my redeemed had come&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODcxXQ==\">Isaiah 63:4<\/a>; cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg2MDMiOjJ9LHsiMTg4MTgiOjJ9LFsxODg0Nl1d\">47:3-4; 59:17-18; 61:2<\/a>). That day of <em>vengeance<\/em> is also the day of the king of Assyria\/Babylon, whom Jehovah empowers to destroy the wicked (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxNzY5OCwxNzgwMF0seyIxNzg1NCI6NX0seyIxNzkxMyI6OH1d\">Isaiah 2:12; 7:17; 10:3-7; 13:6-13<\/a>). Those who persecute Jehovah&rsquo;s righteous people suffer the curses of the covenants he made with his people at the time he reverses their circumstances.<\/p>",
