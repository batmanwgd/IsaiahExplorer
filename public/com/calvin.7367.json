    "html": " <p> <i>Yet he also is wise. <\/i>,By calling God \u201cwise,\u201d he does not merely bestow on him the honor of an attribute which always belongs to him, but censures the craftiness of those whom he saw to be too much delighted with their own wisdom. He said a little before, (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MjA5XQ==\">Isaiah 29:15 <\/a>,,) that they \u201cdug caves for themselves,\u201d when they thought that, by hidden plans and secret contrivances, they avoided and deceived the eyes of God. He now pours witty ridicule on this madness, by affirming that, on the other hand, wisdom belongs also to God; indirectly bringing against them the charge of believing that they could shut God\u2019s mouth as not knowing their affairs. As if he had said, \u201cWhat shall become of your wisdom?\u201d Will the effect of it be that God shall cease to be \u201cwise?\u201d On the contrary, by reproving your vanity, he will give practical demonstration that \u201che taketh the wise in their own craftiness.\u201d (<a class=\"ref\">Job 5:13;1 Corinthians 3:19 <\/a>.) <\/p>,\n <p>We may draw from this a general doctrine, that they who shelter themselves under craftiness and secret contrivances, gain nothing but to provoke still more the wrath of God. A bad conscience always flees from the judgment of God, and seeks lurking-places to conceal itself. Wicked men contrive various methods of guarding and fortifying themselves against God, and think that they are wise and circumspect, even though they be covered only with empty masks; while others, blinded by their elevated rank, despise God and his threatenings. Thus, by declaring that \u201cGod is also wise,\u201d the Prophet wounds them painfully and sharply, that they may not lay claim to so great craftiness as to be capable of imposing on God by their delusions. <\/p>,\n <p> <i>He will arise against the house of the evil-doers. <\/i>,As they did not deserve that he should reason with them, he threatens that they shall feel that God has his arguments at his command, for ensnaring transgressors. First, they did not think that God has sufficient foresight, because he did not, according to the ordinary practice of the world, provide for their safety amidst so great dangers, and because they considered all threatenings to be empty bugbears, as if they had it in their power by some means to guard against them. Hence arises their eagerness to make every exertion, and their hardihood to plot contrivances. He therefore threatens that God will take revenge on so gross an insult, and that he has at his command the means of executing what he has promised; and that no schemes, inventions, or craftiness can overthrow the word of God. <\/p>,\n <p> <i>Of the workers of vanity. <\/i>,He gives them this appellation, because they wished to fortify themselves against the hand of God by a useless defense; that is, by the unlawful aid of the Egyptians. Formerly, it might be thought that he silently admitted their claim to the appellation of \u201cwise men,\u201d by contrasting them with the wisdom of God; but now he scatters the smoke, and openly displays their shame and disgrace. This teaches us that there is nothing better than to renounce our own judgment, and to submit entirely to God; because all that earnest caution by which wicked men torture themselves has no solidity, but, on the contrary, as if on purpose, provokes the wrath of God by the deceitful contrivances of the flesh. <\/p>,\n\n <p>FT574 \u201cReturn to him against whom you have entertained deep thoughts; in the same manner as you revolted, and have still revolted, from him, return now to him.\u201d \u2014 <i>Jarchi <\/i>,. Among the commentators who belonged to the Hebrew nation, or wrote in the Hebrew language, Jarchi was probably held, on the ground of the first part of his paraphrase, to support that view which our Author condemns; but the second part of it, beginning with \u201cin the same manner as\u201d approaches very closely to the Reformer\u2019s own words. \u2014 <i>Ed <\/i> <\/p>,\n <p>FT575 Piscator and others construe <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05dc\u05d0\u05e9\u05e8 <\/span>,(<i>l\u0103\u0103sh\u0115r <\/i>) as equivalent to <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d0\u05e9\u05e8 \u05de\u05de\u05e0\u05d5 \u05d0\u05dc\u05d9\u05d5 <\/span>,, (\u0113 <i>l\u0101iv \u0103sh\u0115r m\u012dmm\u0115nn\u016b <\/i>,,) \u201cto him from whom.\u201d Vitringa does not reject this exposition, which he acknowledges to be supported by an analogous use of <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05de\u05d0\u05e9\u05e8 <\/span>,, (<i>m\u0113\u0103sh\u0115r <\/i>,,) in <a class=\"ref\">Ruth 2:9 <\/a>; but he pronounces the rendering, \u201caccording as.\u201d to be more elegant and probably more correct. Modern critics, however, approve of the meaning given in our common version. \u201cThe syntax may be solved either by supposing \u2018to him\u2019 to be understood, and giving <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05dc\u05d0\u05e9\u05e8 <\/span>,(<i>l\u0103\u0103sh\u0115r <\/i>) the sense of \u2018with respect to whom,\u2019 or by assuming that, as both these ideas could be expressed by this one phrase, it was put but once in order to avoid the tautology.\u201d \u2014 <i>Alexander <\/i>,. The other mode of resolving the syntax, by bringing out the sense, \u201cto him from whom,\u201d appears to adhere more closely to the usage of the Hebrew language. \u2014 <i>Ed <\/i> <\/p>,\n <p>FT576 <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d4\u05e2\u05de\u05d9\u05e7\u05d5 \u05e1\u05e8\u05d4 <\/span>,(<i>h\u0115gn\u0115m\u012bk\u016bs\u0101r\u0101h <\/i>) literally signifies, \u201cthey have deepened revolt;\u201d and Professor Alexander justly remarks that the substitution of the second person for the third, in the ancient versions, and in Barnes, (ye have revolted), is wholly arbitrary. \u2014 <i>Ed <\/i> <\/p>,\n <p>FT577 \u201c <span class=\"aramaic_text\">,Enfans rebelles <\/span>,;\u201d\u2014\u201cRebellious children.\u201d <\/p>,\n <p>FT578 \u201c <span class=\"aramaic_text\">,Et pourtant il marque la repentance par les fruits <\/span>,;\u201d\u2014\u201cAnd therefore he points out repentance by the fruits.\u201d <\/p>,\n <p>FT579 See <i>Commentary on Isaiah <\/i>,, vol. 1 p. 118 <\/p>,\n <p>FT580 That is, he does not follow the ancient versions, by viewing it as an adjective, qualifying the word \u201chands,\u201d\u2014\u201cyour sinful hands.\u201d \u2014 <i>Ed <\/i> <\/p>,\n <p>FT581 <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05dc\u05d0 \u05d0\u05d9\u05e9 <\/span>,(<i>l\u014d\u012bsh <\/i>,,) not of a man, that is, of one who is totally different from a man.
