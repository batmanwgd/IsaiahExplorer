In our day, many do the same, listening to guidance and counsel from many sources, while rejecting the true prophets and the Holy Spirit of God.<\/p> <p><i>poured out a libation, but not of<\/i> <i>my spirit. <\/i>Judah made offerings to false gods and offerings that were not directed or approved by the Lord.<\/p> <p><i>add sin to sin. <\/i>Judah refused to follow the counsel of the Lord concerning her relationship with Assyria, which brought Judah under Assyrian vassalage. Judah's people then sought to free themselves from the shadow of Assyria by forming an alliance with Egypt, again ignoring the Lord's counsel, thus adding \"sin to sin\" (<a class=\"ref\">Jer. 2:18<\/a>). Likewise, we add sin to sin by first rejecting the voice of the Lord and then walking in our own way contrary to his.<\/p> ",
