    "html": "<p>The king of Assyria\/Babylon&rsquo;s boundless ambition extends to being even as the Most High God. Resembling the gods of ancient Near Eastern myth, he seeks to &ldquo;rise&rdquo; or &ldquo;ascend&rdquo; (<em>&rsquo;e&lsquo;eleh<\/em>) above the &ldquo;stars of God&rdquo;&mdash;that is, above those sons of God who have attained celestial glory or exaltation (<a class=\"ref\">Psalm 82:6<\/a> ;<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDQ3LDE4NDUyXQ==\">Isaiah 40:26, 31<\/a>). The mythological &ldquo;mount of assembly&rdquo; of the gods is identified with &ldquo;Zaphon,&rdquo; the North or Pole Star. Of course, ascent &ldquo;in the heavens.... above the altitude of the clouds&rdquo;&mdash;as in a counterfeit of celestial exaltation&mdash;is possible to attain with today&rsquo;s space technology.<\/p> ",
