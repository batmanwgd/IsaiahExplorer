    "html": " <p> (7) Hath he smitten him . . .\u2014The pronouns are left in the English Version somewhat obscure, but the use of capitals makes the meaning plain: \u201cHath He (Jehovah) smitten him (Israel) as He smote those that smote him; or is he slain according to the slaughter of those that are slain by Him?\u201d A slight alteration in the last clause in the text gives, according to the slaughter of his slayers. In any case the thought is that Jehovah had chastised the guilt with a leniency altogether exceptional. They had not been punished as others had been. The words admit, however, of another meaning, which is preferred by some critics, viz., that Jehovah doth not smite Israel with the smiting like that with which his (Israel\u2019s) smiters smote him\u2014i.e., had not punished, as the oppressors had punished, ruthlessly and in hate, but had in His wrath remembered mercy. <\/p> ",
