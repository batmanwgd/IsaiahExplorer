However, another meaning could be that these watchmen speak with a unified voice (they lift up the voice <i>together<\/i>). Latter-day revelation declares: \"And every decision made by [these presiding] quorums [of watchmen] must be by the unanimous voice of the same; that is, every member in each quorum must be agreed to its decisions.\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 107:27<\/a>.)<\/p>",
