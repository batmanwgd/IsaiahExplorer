    "html": " <p>With the restoration of the gospel, the righteous of latter-day Israel, which includes the Lamanites, is no longer comparable to a wilderness or desert but is like the garden of God, or Eden (see commentary on 27:10; see also <a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 33:5<\/a>). <b> <\/b>Zion[\"blossom[s] abundantly\" (35:2), thanks to the abundance of \"waters,\" \"streams,\" and \"springs of water\" (35:6-7)\u2014all of which refer symbolically to Jesus Christ and the great life-giving blessings associated with him and his gospel.<\/p> <p>Modern revelation adds light to this chapter of Isaiah: \"But before the great day of the Lord shall come, Jacob shall flourish in the wilderness, and the Lamanites shall blossom as the rose. Zion shall flourish upon the hills and rejoice upon the mountains\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 49:24-25<\/a>). The revelation places Jacob in the \"wilderness,\" a term also used in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isa. 35<\/a>, and we learn that Jacob and Zion shall \"flourish\" and the Lamanites shall \"blossom.\" The words <i>flourish<\/i> and <i>blossom<\/i> suggest that Jacob, Zion, and the Lamanites are like plants or flowers.<\/p> <p> <a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 49<\/a> presents a host of teachings about what Zion will be like in the last days:<\/p> <p>It will be a place of rejoicing, joy, gladness, singing, and glory (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 49:1-2,  10<\/a>) <\/p> <p>Inhabitants of Zion will \"see the glory of the Lord\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 49:2<\/a>) <\/p> <p>Inhabitants of Zion will strengthen one another spiritually (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 49:3-4<\/a>) <\/p> <p>God will open the eyes of the blind and the ears of the deaf (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 49:5<\/a>) <\/p> <p>The waters of life will flow abundantly (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 49:6-7<\/a>) <\/p> <p>The \"way of holiness\" will be in Zion (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 49:8<\/a>) <\/p> <p>The \"way of holiness\" will be off limits to the \"unclean\" and enemies of Zion (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 49:8-9<\/a>) <\/p> <p>The \"way of holiness\" will be for the \"redeemed\" and \"ransomed of the Lord\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 49:9-10<\/a>) <\/p> <p>Those who \"come to Zion\" will experience \"everlasting joy,\" and \"sorrow and sighing shall flee away\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 49:10<\/a>). <\/p> <p>We also read some, but not all, of Isaiah's statements literally, seeing in our time the deserts of both Utah and Israel responding to the Lord's blessing the land. The great irrigation systems and man-made water systems enable places that were once wastelands to become farming communities; hence, the desert and the wilderness are blossoming as a rose.<\/p> <blockquote> The <i>wilderness<\/i> and the <i>solitary place<\/i> shall <u>be glad<\/u> for them;     <br>and the <i>desert<\/i> shall <u>rejoice<\/u><i>,<\/i> and <u>blossom<\/u> as the rose.
