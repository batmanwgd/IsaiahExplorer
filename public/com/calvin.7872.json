    "html": "<p><i>Peace shall come. <\/i> The Prophet describes what shall be the condition of believers in death; for the wicked, who think that there is no life but the present, imagine that good men have perished; because in death they see nothing but ruin. For this reason he says that \u201cPeace shall come,\u201d which is more desirable than a thousand lives full of trouble; as if he compared them to discharged soldiers, who are and allowed to enjoy case and quietness.<\/p> \n<p><i>They shall rest in their beds. <\/i> He adds the metaphor of sleep, in order to show that they shall be absolutely free from all the uneasiness of cares, just as if they were safely pleasantly asleep \u201con their beds.\u201d<\/p> \n<p><i>Whosoever walketh before him. <\/i> I do not think that the verb \u201cwalketh\u201d is connected with<span class=\"greek-hebrew\"> \u05e9\u05dc\u05d5\u05dd<\/span> , (<i>shalom<\/i> ,) \u201cpeace,\u201d as some do, who suppose the meaning to be this, that peace shall go before believers, so as to be, as it were, the guide of their life. But I am of opinion that believers, on the contrary, are described by it; as if he had said, \u201cWhosoever walketh before God shall enjoy peace.\u201d Thus, when righteous men die, and their various labors are finished, and their course is ended, they are called to peace and repose. They \u201crest in their beds,\u201d because they do not yet enjoy perfect blessedness and glory; but they wail; for the last day of the resurrection, when everything shall be perfectly restored; and that, I think, is what Isaiah meant.<\/p> \n<p>It will be said, \u201cDo not righteous men enjoy this peace while they live?\u201d for the fruit of faith is, that; \u201cin patience we may possess our souls.\u201d ( <a class=\"ref\">Luke 21:19<\/a>) Although faith produces peace in our hearts, ( <a class=\"ref\">Romans 5:3<\/a>) yet we are tossed about by various storms and tempests; and never in life are we so calm and peaceful as when the Lord takes us to himself. Peaceful and calm, therefore, is the death of the righteous, ( <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 116:15<\/a>) for it is \u201cprecious in the sight of God;\u201d but stormy is the death of the wicked. Hence also we may learn that souls are immortal; for if souls had no feeling, (as some fanatics have dreamed,) they could not enjoy \u201cpeace.\u201d Thus they enjoy peace and repose, because they live in Christ.<\/p> ",
