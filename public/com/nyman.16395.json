    "html": "          <p>The interpretation of this passage has been given by Joseph Smith in <a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 113:1-4<\/a>. The stem of Jesse is Christ. The book of Revelation also identifies Jesus as such (see <a class=\"ref\">Rev. 5:5; 22:16<\/a>). The rod is \"a servant in the hands of Christ, who is partly a descendant of Jesse as well as of Ephraim\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 113:4<\/a>). That the servant is Joseph Smith himself seems evident. President Brigham Young taught that Joseph was a \"pure Ephraimite,\" and this was confirmed by President Joseph Fielding Smith (see DS, 3:253-54, for both statements). His being a pure Ephraimite does not necessarily mean he had only the blood of Ephraim; it may mean he had some of the pure blood of Ephraim in his veins. This is also evidenced by the fact that his father was the Patriarch to the Church, which office belongs to \"the oldest man of the blood of Joseph or of the seed of Abraham\" (TPJS, p. 151). Joseph Smith would likely have had the blood of other tribes in his veins as well, since Israel lived among the Gentiles for hundreds of years. Certainly Joseph Smith had \"much power\" laid upon him, as <a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 113:4<\/a> states. All this fits well with the angel Moroni's declaration to Joseph Smith that the eleventh chapter of Isaiah was about to be fulfilled (see <a class=\"ref\">JS-H 1:40<\/a>).<\/p>     <p>The branch which was to grow out of the roots is Christ (see Bruce R. McConkie, The <i>Promised<\/i> Messiah, [Deseret Book Company, 1978] pp. 192-93). \"Branch\" is capitalized in the KJV. That a branch of Israel is to come out of the mother tree is mentioned in the allegory of Zenos (see <a class=\"ref\">Jacob 5:54-56<\/a>).<\/p>     ",
