But certainly it lay more to the east than north of the greater part of that country: and accordingly, the Scriptures generally speak of the Philistines as being to the west of the Jews: see <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODk5XQ==\">Isaiah 11:14<\/a>. It seems, therefore, that<i>Chaldea,<\/i> and not Judea, is here meant by<i>the north,<\/i> as it generally is in the writings of the prophets; and that the calamity intended is not that spoken of in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzk1OCI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 14:29-30<\/a> , but a new affliction to be brought upon them by the Assyrians or Babylonians: probably the same which Jeremiah predicted as coming from the north on the Philistines, <a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 47:2<\/a> , &c. <i>And none shall be alone in his appointed times<\/i>\u2014When God\u2019s appointed time shall come, not one of all that numerous army that shall invade Palestine, shall desert his colours, lag behind the rest, or withdraw his hand, till the work of destruction be finished.<\/p> ",
