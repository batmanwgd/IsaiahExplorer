It is here addressed by the prophet in a way of encouragement and exhortation to the Jews coming out of Babylon. Jeremiah has given it a different turn, and has thrown it out, as a reproach of the heathen upon the Jews when they were driven from Jerusalem into captivity: -<\/p> \n\n<p>\"Depart; ye are polluted, depart; depart ye, forbear to touch.<\/p> \n\n<p>Yea, they are fled, they are removed: they shall dwell here no more.\"<\/p> \n\n<p><i> <a class=\"ref\">Lamentations 4:15<\/a>. <\/i><\/p><i>\n\n<\/i><p><i><\/i> Of the metrical distribution of these lines, see the Prelim.
