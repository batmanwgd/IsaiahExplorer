Often known simply as Ephraim (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3Nzg1XQ==\">Isaiah 7:2 <\/a>), Israel&rsquo;s Northern Kingdom formed a league with Aram against the threat of an invasion by Assyria (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxNzgxMl0seyIxNzgxNyI6Mn1d\">Isaiah 8:4, 9-10 <\/a>). As types of the end-time, Ephraim and its northern neighbor experience the same demise: when Ephraim&rsquo;s defenses fail, both countries fail. Although Aram loses its sovereignty and remains a pastoral country, a remnant of its people&mdash;as with Ephraim (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODE2NiI6NX0=\">Isaiah 28:1-5 <\/a>)&mdash;survives. <\/p> ",
