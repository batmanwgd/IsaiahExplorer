    "html": "<p> It is also a great Lord who dwells therein, a faithful and almighty defender. <em> \u201cNo, there dwells for us a glorious One, Jehovah; a place of streams, canals of wide extent, into which no fleet of rowing vessels ventures, and which no strong man of war shall cross. For Jehovah is our Judge; Jehovah is our war-Prince; Jehovah is our King; He will bring us salvation.\u201d<\/em> Following upon the negative clauses in  , the next v. commences with <em> k\u0131\u0304 'im <\/em> (<em> imo <\/em> ). Glorious (<em> 'add\u0131\u0304r <\/em> ) is Jehovah, who has overthrown Lebanon, i.e., Assyria (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODg1XQ==\">Isaiah 10:34<\/a>). He dwells in Jerusalem for the good of His people - a place of streams, i.e., one resembling a place of streams, from the fact that He dwells therein. Luzzatto is right in maintaining, that \u05d1\u05bc\u05d5 and \u05d9\u05e2\u05d1\u05e8\u05e0\u05bc\u05d5\u05bc point back to \u05de\u05e7\u05d5\u05dd , and therefore that <em> m e ko\u0304m <\/em> is neither equivalent to <em> loco <\/em> (<em> tachath <\/em> , instead of), which would be quite possible indeed, as <a class=\"ref\">1 Kings 21:19<\/a>, if not <a class=\"ref\">Hosea 2:1<\/a>, clearly proves (cf., <a class=\"ref\">1 Kings 22:38<\/a>), nor used in the sense of substitution or compensation. The meaning is, that, by virtue of Jehovah's dwelling there, Jerusalem had become a place, or equivalent to a place, or broad streams, like those which in other instances defended the cities they surrounded (e.g., Babylon, the \u201ctwisted snake,\u201d <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTUzXQ==\">Isaiah 27:1<\/a>), and of broad canals, which kept off the enemy, like moats around a fortification. The word \u05d9\u05d0\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd was an Egyptian word, that had become naturalized in Hebrew; nevertheless it is a very natural supposition, that the prophet was thinking of the <em> No<\/em> of Egypt, which was surrounded by waters, probably Nile-canals (see Winer, <em> R.W.<\/em> <a class=\"ref\">Nahum 3:8<\/a>). The adjective in which <em> ya\u0302daim <\/em> brings out with greater force the idea of breadth, as in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MDcxXQ==\">Isaiah 22:18<\/a> (\u201con both sides\u201d), belongs to both the nouns, which are placed side by side, \u03b1\u0300\u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03b4\u03b5\u0301\u03c4\u03c9\u03c2 (because permutative). The presence of Jehovah was to Jerusalem what the broadest streams and canals were to other cities; and into these streams and canals, which Jerusalem had around it spiritually in Jehovah Himself, no rowing vessels ventured \u05d1\u05bc \u05d4\u05dc \u05da , <em> ingredi <\/em> ). Luzzatto renders the word \u201cships of roving,\u201d i.e., pirate ships; but this is improbable, as <em> shu\u0304t <\/em> , when used as a nautical word, signifies to row. Even a majestic <em> ts\u0131\u0304 <\/em> , i.e., <em> trieris magna <\/em> , could not cross it: a colossal vessel of this size would be wrecked in these mighty and dangerous waters. The figure is the same as that in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTMyXQ==\">Isaiah 26:1<\/a>. In the consciousness of this inaccessible and impenetrable defence, the people of Jerusalem gloried in their God, who watched as a <em> sho\u0304phe\u0304t <\/em> over Israel's rights and honour, who held as <em> m e choqe\u0304q <\/em> the commander's rod, and ruled as <em> melekh <\/em> in the midst of Israel; so that for every future danger it was already provided with the most certain help.<\/p>",
