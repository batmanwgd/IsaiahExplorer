    "html": "<p>Jesus experienced tragedy and sorrow throughout His life. Members of His own family did not accept Him as the Messiah at first (see<a class=\"ref\">John 7:5<\/a>). People in His hometown sought to kill Him (see<a class=\"ref\">Luke 4:16&ndash;30<\/a>). His countrymen, the Jews, rejected His messianic calling (see<a class=\"ref\">John 1:11<\/a>). One friend betrayed Him; another denied knowing Him (see<a class=\"ref\">Luke 22:48, 54&ndash;62<\/a>). In the end, &ldquo;all the disciples forsook him, and fled&rdquo; (<a class=\"ref\">Matthew 26:56<\/a>). His enemies demanded His crucifixion (see<a class=\"ref\">Matthew 27:22&ndash;23<\/a>).<\/p><p>President Joseph Fielding Smith asked: &ldquo;Was not Christ a man of sorrows? Was he not rejected of men? Was he not acquainted with grief? Did not the people (figuratively) hide their faces from him? Did not the people esteem him not? Surely he knew our griefs and carried our sorrows, but he was thought to be stricken of God and forsaken by him. Did not the people say that? How true all these things are!&rdquo; (<em>Doctrines of Salvation,<\/em> 1:24.)<\/p><p class=\"cite\"> LDS Church Educational System Old Testament Student Manual, 1 Kings&ndash;Malachi, Religion 302, Chapter 17, Item 22<\/p> ",
