Here are,  I. Gracious promises to those that adhere to the law and to the  testimony  while those that seek to familiar spirits shall be driven  into darkness and dimness, they shall see a great light, relief in the  midst of their distresses, typical of gospel grace.  1. In the doctrine of the Messiah,   <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 9:1-3<\/a>.  2. His victories,   <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 9:4<\/a>.  3. His government and dominion as Immanuel,   <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 9:6<\/a>.  II. Dreadful threatenings against the people of Israel, who had  revolted from and were enemies to the house of David, that they should  be brought to utter ruin, that their pride should bring them down  (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 9:8-10<\/a>),  that their neighbours should make a prey of them  (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 9:11<\/a>),  that, for their impenitence and hypocrisy, all their ornaments and  supports should be cut off  (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 9:13-17<\/a>),  and that by the wrath of God against them, and their wrath one against  another, they should be brought to utter ruin,   <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 9:18-21<\/a>.  And this is typical of the final destruction of all the enemies of the  Son of David and his kingdom.<\/p>",
