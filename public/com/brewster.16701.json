The Nephite text declares \"their sin <u>tobe even<\/u> as Sodom, <u>and<\/u> they <u>cannot<\/u> hide it.\" (13:9.) As noted in the commentary on <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3Njk2XQ==\">Isaiah 2:10<\/a>, no sin will be hidden from the Lord. Isaiah draws a contrast between thewell-being of the righteous and the woe that will come upon the wicked.<\/p>     <table>         <tbody>             <tr>                 <td>8 For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen<u>:<\/u> because their tongue and their doings <u>are<\/u> against the Lord, to provoke the eyes of his glory.                     <br>                     <br>9 The <i>shew<\/i> of their countenance doth witness against them<u>;<\/u> and <u>they<\/u> declare their sin as Sodom, they hide it <u>not<\/u>. <i>Woe<\/i> unto their soul<u>!<\/u> for they have rewarded evil unto themselves<u>.<\/u>                     <br>                     <br>10 Say <u>ye to<\/u> the righteous<u>,<\/u> that it <u>shall be<\/u> well with <u>him:<\/u> for they shall eat the fruit of their doings.                     <br>                     <br>11 <i>Woe<\/i> unto the wicked<u>! it shall be ill with him:<\/u> for the reward of <u>his<\/u> hands shall be <u>given him.<\/u>                     <br>                 <\/td>                 <td>8 For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen<u>,<\/u> because their tongue<u>s<\/u> and their doings <u>have been<\/u> against the Lord, to provoke the eyes of his glory.                     <br>                     <br>9 The <i>show<\/i> of their countenance doth witness against them<u>,<\/u> and <u>doth<\/u> declare their sin <u>to be even<\/u> as Sodom, <u>and<\/u> they <u>cannot<\/u> hide it. <i>Wo<\/i> unto their soul<u>s,<\/u> for they have rewarded evil unto themselves<u>!<\/u>                     <br>                     <br>10 Say <u>unto<\/u> the righteous that it <u>is<\/u> well with <u>them;<\/u> for they shall eat the fruit of their doings.                     <br>                     <br>11 <i>Wo<\/i> unto the wicked<u>, for they shall perish;<\/u> for the reward of <u>their<\/u> hands shall be <u>upon them!<\/u>                     <br>                 <\/td>             <\/tr>         <\/tbody>     <\/table>",
