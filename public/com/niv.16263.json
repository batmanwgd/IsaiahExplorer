This \u201cservant\u201d is clearly not the nation of Israel, since they did not suffer because of their obedience but because of their rebellion.<\/p>     <p>\u2003There is also a further indication (cf. 49:2) that the Servant will reveal God through speech. His \u201cears\u201d have been \u201copened\u201d to hear God\u2019s message (50:5), and his \u201ctongue\u201d has been \u201cinstructed\u201d (50:4) how to declare it. But if the message is declared, there is going to be abuse (50:6), and the Servant is willing to bear that abuse because he knows that God will vindicate him in the end (50:7\u20139). No one will be able to successfully accuse him of either disobeying God or of falsifying the message. Nor will those who \u201cbeat\u201d him and pull out his \u201cbeard\u201d be able to make him stop obeying his Lord. In fact, his accusers will be unable to stand at the end.<\/p>     <p>\u2003The certainty that the Lord will \u201cvindicate\u201d him in the end means that the Servant has the courage to be obedient, setting his \u201cface like flint\u201d to do his Master\u2019s will. The emphasis on the servant\u2019s speech reminds us of what is said about the Messiah elsewhere. He will \u201cstrike the earth with the rod of his mouth\u201d (11:4), and \u201cthe <small>LORD<\/small> has anointed me to preach good news to the poor\u201d (61:1).<\/p>     ",
