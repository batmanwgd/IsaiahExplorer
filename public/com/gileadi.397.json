Arid lands and wilderness, where wild animals used to live, on the other hand, regenerate and blossom into paradise (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3sic2luZ2xlcyI6WzE4Njc3XX0seyIxODMyMiI6N30seyIxODQ3MCI6Mn1d\">Isaiah 35:1-7; 41:18-19; 51:3<\/a>). Because beasts and birds also represent people, Isaiah projects their imagery onto another level, showing how common animals typify life&rsquo;s true values&mdash;finding a mate, building a nest, and raising young. In effect, Jehovah provides for those who follow his design for his creation.<\/p>",
