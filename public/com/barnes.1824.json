    "html": " <p> <em>For a small moment <\/em>&mdash;The Chaldee and Syriac render this, &lsquo;In a little anger.&rsquo; Lowth has adopted this, but without sufficient authority. The Hebrew means, &lsquo;For a little moment;&rsquo; a very short time. The reference here is probably to the captivity at Babylon, when they were apparently forsaken by Yahweh. Though to them this appeared long, yet compared with their subsequent prosperity, it was but an instant of time. Though this had probably a primary reference to the captivity then, yet there can be no impropriety in applying it to other similar cases. It contains an important principle; that is, that though God appears to forsake his people, yet it will be comparatively but for a moment. He will remember his covenant, and however long their trials may seem to be, yet compared with the subsequent mercies and the favors which shall result from them, they will seem to be but as the sorrows of the briefest point of duration (compare <a class=\"ref\">2 Corinthians 4:17<\/a>). <\/p> <p> <em>But with great mercies <\/em>&mdash;The contrast here is not that of duration but of magnitude. The forsaking was &lsquo;little,&rsquo; the mercies would be &lsquo;great.&rsquo; It would be mercy that they would be recalled at all after all their faults and crimes; and the mercy which would be bestowed in the enlargement of their numbers would be inexpressibly great. <\/p> <p> <em>Will I gather thee <\/em>&mdash;Will I collect thee from thy dispersions, and gather thee to myself as my own people. <\/p> ",
