By a parable, under the similitude of an unfruitful vineyard, representing the great favours God had bestowed upon them, their disappointing his expectations from them, and the ruin they had thereby deserved, <a class=\"ref\"><\/a>. II. By an enumeration of the sins that did abound among them, with a threatening of punishments that should answer to the sins. 1. Covetousness, and greediness of worldly wealth, which shall be punished with famine, <a class=\"ref\"><\/a>. 2. Rioting, revelling, and drunkenness ( <a class=\"ref\"><\/a>), which shall be punished with captivity and all the miseries that attend it, <a class=\"ref\"><\/a>. 3. Presumption in sin, and defying the justice of God, ver. 18,19. 4. Confounding the distinctions between virtue and vice, and so undermining the principles of religion, <a class=\"ref\"><\/a>. 5.
