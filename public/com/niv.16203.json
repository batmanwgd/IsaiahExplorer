The language is that of the court. God calls the defendants, the \u201cnations\u201d and the \u201cpeoples,\u201d to hear the decree pronounced against them. But the judgment does not merely involve the \u201cearth\u201d; it affects the entire cosmos, with the \u201cstars\u201d being \u201cdissolved\u201d and the \u201csky rolled up\u201d (34:4).<\/p>             <p>\u2003God\u2019s anger is particularly directed against the \u201carmies,\u201d which aptly symbolize the arrogance and pride of \u201cnations.\u201d He will devote them to complete destruction (34:2). The verb used here (and the corresponding noun in v. 5) is <em>hrm<\/em>, which speaks of ritual destruction for offenses against God. It is the same term used of the Canaanites in Joshua 6:17 and of the Amalekites in 1 Samuel 15:3. This is not merely a contest to see who is stronger; it is a conflict between the Creator and those who have rebelled against him, a conflict with cosmic consequences.<\/p>             ",
