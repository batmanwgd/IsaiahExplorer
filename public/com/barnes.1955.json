The idea is, &lsquo;Keep not silence yourselves, nor let him rest in silence. Pray without ceasing; and do not intermit your efforts until the desires of your hearts shall be granted, and Zion shall be established, and the world saved.&rsquo;<\/p><p><em>Till he establish<\/em> &mdash;Until he shall establish Jerusalem, and restore it to its former rank and privileges.<\/p><p><em>Till he make Jerusalem a praise in the earth<\/em> &mdash;That it may be the subject of universal commendation and rejoicing, instead of being an object of reproach and scorn. The truth taught here is, that it is the privilege and duty of the ministers of God to pray unceasingly for the extension of his kingdom. Day and night the voice of prayer is to be urged, and urged as if they would give Yahweh no rest until the desires of their hearts should be granted (compare<a class=\"ref\">Luke 18:1<\/a> ff).<\/p> ",
