    "html": "<p><em> \u201cWhom then would he teach knowledge? And to whom make preaching intelligible? To those weaned from the milk? To those removed from the breast? For precept upon precept, precept upon precept, line upon line, line upon line, a little here, a little there!\u201d<\/em> They sneer at the prophet, that intolerable moralist. They are of age, and free; and he does not need to bring knowledge to them (<em> da\u201bath <\/em> as in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODk0XQ==\">Isaiah 11:9<\/a>), or make them understand the proclamation. They know of old to what he would lead. Are they little children that have just been weaned (on the constructives, see <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODMyLDE3NzUxLDE4MjM2XQ==\">Isaiah 9:2; Isaiah 5:11; Isaiah 30:18<\/a>; Ges. \u00a7114, 1), and who must let themselves be tutored? For the things he preaches are nothing but endless petty teazings. The short words (<em> tsa\u0302v <\/em> , as in <a class=\"ref\">Hosea 5:11<\/a>), together with the diminutive \u05d6\u05e2\u05d9\u05e8 (equivalent to the Arabic <em> sugayyir <\/em> , mean, from <em> sag\u0131\u0304r <\/em> , small), are intended to throw ridicule upon the smallness and vexatious character of the prophet's interminable and uninterrupted chidings, as \u05dc (= \u05e2\u05dc , \u05d0\u05dc ; comp. \u05d9\u05e1\u05e3 \u05dc , <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTQ2XQ==\">Isaiah 26:15<\/a>) implies that they are; just as the philosophers in <a class=\"ref\">Acts 17:18<\/a> call Paul a \u03c3\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03bc\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u0301\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 , a collector of seeds, i.e., a dealer in trifles. And in the repetition of the short words we may hear the heavy babbling language of the drunken scoffers.<\/p>",
