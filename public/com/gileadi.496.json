    "html": "<p>Those who ultimately participate in the new exodus from the four directions of the earth pertain to Isaiah&rsquo;s son\/servant category and are identified as Jehovah&rsquo;s &ldquo;sons&rdquo; and &ldquo;daughters&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 49:22<\/a>). That implies that from the time Jehovah&rsquo;s servant commences his ministry to the Jacob\/Israel category, those who were formerly blind and deaf have, in the interim, ascended not only to the Zion\/Jerusalem category but beyond that (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 29:18-19; 35:5; 42:7, 18-21<\/a>). In other words, they have been re-created&mdash;&ldquo;formed, molded, and wrought&rdquo;&mdash;to an elect category of Jehovah&rsquo;s people (cf. <a class=\"ref\">Matthew 24:31<\/a>).<\/p><p>Persons in Isaiah&rsquo;s son\/servant or elect category make individual covenants with Jehovah in the pattern of King David and his heirs. Under the terms of the Davidic Covenant, they become Jehovah&rsquo;s vassals and saviors in their own right as was King Hezekiah. As noted, the servant&rsquo;s role &ldquo;to open eyes that are blind&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 42:7<\/a>) involves soliciting the release of Jehovah&rsquo;s blind and deaf people from bondage in the pattern of Moses: &ldquo;Let my people go!&rdquo; (<a class=\"ref\">Exodus 5:1<\/a>). On this occasion, however, the servant doesn&rsquo;t petition Pharaoh for Jacob\/Israel&rsquo;s release but the nations who keep them captive.<\/p>",
