This book of the Lord may be the \"book of life\" identified more than a dozen times in the scriptures (<a class=\"ref\">Dan. 12:1; Rev. 3:5<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\"> 20:12; D&amp;C 76:68<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\"> 128:7<\/a>). <\/p> <p><i>none shall lack their mate. <\/i>Those whose names are written in the book will have their spouses through eternity. This is a rare Old Testament reference to eternal marriage. Note the parallel in 34:15, in which Isaiah states that creatures would have their mates after the destruction of Edom\u2014meaning, they would propagate their species at least for a few generations. Here, Isaiah promises that after the destruction of the world, those whose names are written in the book of the Lord will also have their mates.<\/p> <p><i>my spirit&hellip;gathered them.<\/i> This passage speaks of the role of the Holy Ghost in gathering individuals to the gospel of Jesus Christ.<\/p> ",
