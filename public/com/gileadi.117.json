Jehovah appoints the king of Assyria as his instrument to afflict his people who reject him (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzg1NiI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 10:5-6<\/a>). As his people&rsquo;s king and protector&mdash;as their proxy representative&mdash;Ahaz, by his disloyalty to Israel&rsquo;s God, directly impacts what happens to his people. It is just a matter of time, too, before Isaiah&rsquo;s pronouncement is fulfilled and a righteous &ldquo;son&rdquo; or vassal (<em>ben <\/em>)&mdash;Immanuel&mdash;replaces the unrighteous Ahaz (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzc5NyI6M30=\">vv 14-16<\/a>). <\/p> ",
