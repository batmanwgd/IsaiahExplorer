It has been unproductive, in spite of having been planted under the best of conditions and having received the best of care. The Lord laments, \"What could have been done more to my vineyard that I have not done in it?\"<\/p>     <p>He pronounces judgment upon the vineyard, tearing down its protective fences and leaving it open to predators.<\/p>     <p>The reader would do well to study this chapter in conjunction with <a class=\"ref\">Jacob 5<\/a> in the Book of Mormon, where a similar parable or allegory is presented.<\/p>     <table>         <tbody>             <tr>                 <td><b><a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzQ1XQ==\">Isaiah 5<\/a><br><br><br>1 <u>Now<\/u> will I sing to my <i>wellbeloved<\/i> a song of my beloved touching his vineyard.
