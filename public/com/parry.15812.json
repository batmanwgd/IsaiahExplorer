The Psalmist wrote, \"One thing have I desired of the Lord,&hellip;that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the Lord, and to enquire in his temple\" (<a class=\"ref\">Ps. 27:4<\/a>). In the latter days the Lord commanded, \"Organize yourselves;&hellip;and establish a house, even a house of prayer, a house of fasting,&hellip;a house of God\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 88:119; 109:16<\/a>). <\/p> <p><i>all people.<\/i> The blessings of the covenant and the temple will be offered to everyone, regardless of race or physical imperfection (<a class=\"ref\">Alma 19:86; D&amp;C 38:16<\/a>). <\/p> <p><i>offerings\/sacrifices.<\/i> <i>Offerings<\/i> and <i>sacrifices <\/i>are offered to the Lord in the temple, according to his command. The sacrifices and offerings of the faithful will be effective in helping us to draw nearer to him.<\/p> <p><i>mine altar.<\/i> The place of sacrifice in the temple is the <i>altar.<\/i><\/p> ",
