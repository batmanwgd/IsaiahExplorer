    "html": " <p> <i>The Lord Jehovah hath opened mine ear. <\/i> He again repeats what he had formerly said, and here includes everything that belongs to the office of a teacher; for the \u201copening of the ear\u201d must be understood to refer not only to doctrine, but to the whole calling; that is, when he takes one to be his servant, and intbrms of his duty him whom he has determined to send, when he gives commands, and enjoins him to execute what he commands. But the Lord \u201copens the ear,\u201d not only when he declares what is his will, but when he powerfully affects a man\u2019s heart and moves him to render obedience, as it is said, <\/p> \n <p>\u201cThou hast bored mine ear.\u201d (<a class=\"ref\">Psalms 40:6<\/a>.) <\/p> \n <p>And Christ says, <\/p> \n <p> <span> \u201cWhosoever hath heard and learned from the Father cometh to me.\u201d \n(<\/span> <a class=\"ref\">John 6:45<\/a>.) <\/p> \n <p>Such is also the import of the second clause, <i>And I was not rebellious, <\/i> the meaning of which may be thus summed up: \u201cHe undertakes nothing at random, but, being fully convinced of God\u2019s calling, he discharges the office of a teacher, though it is laborious and difficult, because he is ready to obey.\u201d <\/p> ",
