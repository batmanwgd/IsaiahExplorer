See <a class=\"ref\">Ezekiel 22:30<\/a>. <i>And wondered<\/i> \u2014 Hebrew,  <span class=\"hebrew_text\">\u05d5\u05d9\u05e9\u05c1\u05ea\u05d5\u05de\u05dd<\/span>, <i>was amazed, <\/i>or <i>astonished, <\/i>an expression which denotes both God\u2019s solicitude about their condition, and their stupidity, in not laying it to heart themselves, especially considering that they had been a people well instructed, and yet, when under the guilt of such gross sins, should be no more solicitous to obtain pardon. <i>Therefore, <\/i>or, <i>yet, his arm brought salvation unto him <\/i>\u2014 That is, to his people; <i>and his righteousness it sustained him <\/i>\u2014 His justice; seeing there could be no justice found among them, he would avenge the innocent himself. Since magistrates and societies for the reformation of manners fail of doing their part, the one will not do justice, nor the other call for it, God will let them know he can effect it without them, and thus prepare his people for mercy. And then the work of deliverance shall be wrought by the immediate influence of the divine grace on men\u2019s spirits, and of the divine providence on their affairs. When God stirred up the spirit of Cyrus, and brought his people out of Babylon, not by human wisdom nor power, but by the <i>Spirit of the Lord, <\/i>then his own arm brought salvation to them, which arm is not shortened now.<\/p>",
