Or perhaps the time of which Isaiah speaks is yet to come, and Tyre is a symbol of the wealthy nations of the world who, in the last days, will bring gifts, money, and honor to the Lord and his people (60:5-7; <a class=\"ref\">Ps. 45:12; Hag. 2:8<\/a>). <\/p> <p><i>it shall not be hoarded.<\/i> Tyre possessed treasuries, and her inhabitants \"heaped up silver as the dust, and fine gold as the mire of the streets\" (<a class=\"ref\">Zech. 9:3<\/a>). Isaiah prophesies that Tyre will not hoard her treasures, but \"her merchandise shall be for them that dwell before the Lord\" (23:18).<\/p> ",
