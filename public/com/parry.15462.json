To <i>keep silence<\/i> is perhaps to acknowledge the Lord's supremacy.<\/p> <p><i>let the people renew their strength. <\/i>The promise of renewed strength was made previously to those who rely on the Lord (40:31); the Lord now extends a call to all the peoples of the earth to find renewal in him.<\/p> <p><i>let us come near together to judgment. <\/i>The Lord invites the people of the earth to come, speak, and gather at the \"place of judgment\" (NIV). This gathering is held so the Lord can tell the nations about the \"righteous man from the east\" and about God's righteous acts (41:2-5). After telling the nations, they \"feared\" and \"drew near, and came\" (41:5). The \"speaking\" may be the nations' defense of their actions before the judgment.<\/p> ",
