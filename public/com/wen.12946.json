As here we have the circle of the earth, so elsewhere we read of the circle of heaven, <a class=\"ref\">Job 22:14<\/a>, and of the circle of the deep, or sea, <a class=\"ref\">Proverbs 8:27<\/a>, because the form of the heaven, and earth and sea is circular. Spreadeth - For the benefit of the earth and of mankind, that all parts might partake of its comfortable influences.",
