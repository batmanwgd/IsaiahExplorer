One of these reasons was to fulfill the words of the prophets, and <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTI1XQ==\">Isaiah 25:6<\/a> was quoted as an example. The following verses shed much light on Isaiah's message:<\/p>     <blockquote>And also that a feast of fat things might be prepared for the poor; yea, a feast of fat things, of wine on the lees well refined, that the earth may know that the mouths of the prophets shall not fail;<\/blockquote>     <blockquote>Yea, a supper of the house of the Lord, well prepared, unto which all nations shall be invited.<\/blockquote>     <blockquote>First, the rich and the learned, the wise and the noble;<\/blockquote>     <blockquote>And after that cometh the day of my power; then shall the poor, the lame, and the blind, and the deaf, come in unto the marriage of the Lamb, and partake of the supper of the Lord, prepared for the great day to come.<\/blockquote>     <blockquote>Behold, I, the Lord, have spoken it. (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 58:8-12<\/a>.)<\/blockquote>     <p>The Saints who went into Jackson County in 1831 were to invite the rich and the learned, the wise and the noble (the Gentiles) to participate in the <i>establishment<\/i> of Zion. Since the Gentiles rejected this opportunity, the work would be <i>accomplished<\/i> later by the poor, the lame, the blind, and the deaf (the house of Israel) through the Lord's power. This is the time spoken of by Isaiah in verse 6. The law of consecration was to do away with poverty, and the feast would be physical as well as spiritual. <\/p>     ",
