He stated that until the kingdom of God was set up in all its purity and with all its ordinances, the weak could not be strengthened and the blossoming could not take place. But with the restoration of the Church, those assembled should look for the coming of the Great Redeemer. He further spoke of the healings noted in verses 5 and 6 as being fulfilled when Jesus comes (see JD, 18:145-46). President Hugh B. Brown also cited verse 4 as a Second Coming prophecy (see CR, Apr. 1966, p. 120). Paul quoted verse 3 as an admonition, but not as a fulfillment of prophecy (see <a class=\"ref\">Heb. 12:12<\/a>). The Lord, through the Prophet Joseph Smith, used the wording in verse 3 to instruct Frederick G. Williams in his duties as a member of the First Presidency (see <a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 81:5<\/a>).<\/p>     <p>Elder Orson Pratt used verses 6 and 7 as a prophecy of the Saints' coming to the wilderness of the Rocky Mountains: \"Have you seen anything of the nature of this prediction fulfilled? Latter-day Saints, how was it with this wilderness twenty-eight years ago this summer when the pioneers entered this land, and when several thousands followed them in the autumn of that same year?\" (JD, 18:147.) Elder Paul H. Dunn quoted verse 7 as a description of the \"happy future of Zion\" (CR, Oct. 1968, see p. 52). These verses seem to describe more specifically the Saints in the Rockies: this is concluded from the verses which follow.<\/p>     ",
