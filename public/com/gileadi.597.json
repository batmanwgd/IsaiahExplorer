Although Jehovah may forgive his people their sins when they repent (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NTMxLDE4NTU2XQ==\">Isaiah 43:25; 44:22<\/a>), the effects of their transgressions&mdash;the curses of the covenant&mdash;remain with them until their iniquities are expiated (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTYxLDE4NDIzXQ==\">Isaiah 27:9; 40:2<\/a>). Whether a person suffers for his own transgressions or for those of others&mdash;as do proxy saviors under the terms of the Davidic Covenant (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODcxMV0seyIxODcxNiI6M31d\">Isaiah 52:14; 53:4-6<\/a>)&mdash;all such afflictions originate with covenant curses.<\/p><p>Although the king of Assyria\/Babylon and his proxies may oppress them, Jehovah&rsquo;s people&rsquo;s drinking from Jehovah&rsquo;s <em>hand<\/em> the cup of his <em>wrath<\/em> in reality originates with their own iniquities that are the effects of their transgressions. It serves to purify and sanctify them when they prove loyal to Jehovah by keeping the law of his covenant. Both mother and children remain in this state of iniquity&mdash;suffering covenant curses&mdash;until they awaken to the realization that their curses may be reversed, that with the coming of Jehovah&rsquo;s servant the day of their salvation has dawned (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg2ODMiOjN9LFsxODY0NV0seyIxODY5OCI6Mn0sWzE4NzA0XV0=\">vv 9-11; Isaiah 49:8; 52:1-2, 7<\/a>).<\/p>",
