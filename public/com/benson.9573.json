    "html": "<p><a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODY1XQ==\">Isaiah 62:10<\/a>.<i>Go through the gates <\/i>\u2014 Namely, the gates of Babylon, which shall be thrown open, that those confined in that idolatrous city may leave it with freedom, and return to the land of Israel. In other words, for the expressions are metaphorical, let all obstructions be removed out of the way of the heathen, that they may have free liberty to bid adieu to their idolatries and vices, and come to, and unite themselves with, the Christian Church. Or, the words may be considered as a command given to the ministers and friends of the church to go forth through Zion\u2019s gates, to invite the nations of the earth to turn to God, and join themselves to his people; and, in order thereto, as far as possible, to prepare their way plain before them, as it follows; or to endeavour to win them over by their pure doctrine, their holy lives, and benevolent actions. The expressions are twice doubled, to give them the greater emphasis. <i>Gather out the stones <\/i>\u2014 Let no rock of offence, or stone of stumbling, remain in the way. As if he had said, Go to and fro, and remove every scandal and impediment, and make plain paths for their feet, <a class=\"ref\">Romans 14:13<\/a>. <i>Lift up a standard \u2014 <\/i>An allusion to generals, who usually set up their standards that the soldiers may know whither to repair from all quarters: see <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NjU5XQ==\">Isaiah 49:22<\/a>. Thus is Christ held forth in the preaching of the gospel.<\/p>",
