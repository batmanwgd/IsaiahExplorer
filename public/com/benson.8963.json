    "html": "<p> <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzY2MiI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 1:7-8<\/a>. <i>Your country is desolate<\/i>\u2014\u201cThe description of the ruined and desolate state of the country, in these verses,\u201d says Bishop Lowth, \u201cdoes not suit with any part of the prosperous times of Uzziah and Jotham. It very well agrees with the time of Ahaz, when Judea was ravaged by the joint invasion of the Israelites and Syrians, and by the incursions of the Philistines and Edomites. The date of this prophecy is therefore generally fixed to the time of Ahaz.\u201d<i>Strangers devour it in your presence \u2014<\/i> Which your eyes see to torment you, when there is no power in your hands to deliver you. <i>As overthrown,<\/i> &c. \u2014<span class=\"hebrew_text\"> \u05db\u05de\u05d4\u05e4\u05db\u05ea<\/span> , <i>as the overthrow; of strangers<\/i>\u2014That is, such as strangers bring upon a land which is not likely to continue in their hands, and therefore they spare no persons; and spoil and destroy all things, which is not usually done in wars between persons of the same or of a neighbouring nation. <i>And the daughter of Zion is left<\/i>\u2014Is left solitary, all the neighbouring villages and country round about it being laid waste. <i>As a cottage<\/i>\u2014Or, <i>as a shed in a vineyard,<\/i> as Bishop Lowth translates it, namely, \u201ca little temporary hut, covered with boughs, straw, turf, or the like materials, for a shelter from the heat by day, and the cold and dews by night, for the watchman that kept the garden, or vineyard, during the short season while the fruit was ripening; see <a class=\"ref\">Job 27:18<\/a>; and presently removed when it had served that purpose.\u201d\u2014See Harmer, Observ. 1:454.<\/p> ",
