This promise, by the special blessing of God, was remarkably fulfilled after the defeat of Sennacherib, (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MzgzXQ==\">Isaiah 37:30<\/a> ,) God thus repairing the losses they sustained by that devastation.<i> The oxen likewise, &c., shall eat clean provender<\/i> \u2014 There shall be such plenty of corn that the very beasts, instead of straw, shall eat corn; and that not in the ear, or with the straw, but the pure grain. Vitringa, with some other commentators, thinks it appears plainly, from the next two verses, that the prophet is to be understood in this passage as speaking, not so much literally as figuratively, and that the words contain a splendid promise of pure and abundant spiritual provision, made by the Lord for his people, in the ministry of the word, the spiritual sowing; the effusions of his Spirit,<i> the rain of the seed;<\/i> and in the due administration of his various ordinances,<i> the large pastures<\/i> in which his flock feeds.<\/p> ",
