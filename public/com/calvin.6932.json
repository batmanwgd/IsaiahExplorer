    "html": " <p> <i>And it shall come to pass on that day. <\/i>,In these verses, down to the end of the chapter, the Prophet describes the state of a country torn and wasted; for he intends to present a striking and lively picture of such overwhelming distress that, wherever you turn your eyes, nothing is to be seen but the traces of frightful desolation. Some think that a mitigation of punishment is here promised, but we shall soon see that this does not agree with the context. Though he employs the appellation, <i>a man <\/i>,, without any limitation, yet strictly it is of the richest men that he speaks; for he does not say that every one will have so many; but they who formerly were accustomed to rear a large number of <i>oxen <\/i>,and <i>sheep <\/i>,will be satisfied with having a few. He means, therefore, that all will be reduced to very deep poverty. Some think that the Hebrew word which the Prophet employs, <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d9\u05d7\u05d9\u05d4 <\/span>,, (<i>yechaiyeh <\/i>,,) <i>he shall quicken <\/i>,, means \u201cto deliver from death;\u201d but the meaning which I have adopted is more natural and more generally approved. <\/p>,",
