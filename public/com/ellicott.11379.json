It was Sennacherib\u2019s special glory, as recorded in his inscriptions, that he had provided cities with water which were before scantily supplied, that he had made wells even in the deserts (Records of the Past, i. 29, 31, ).<\/p>\n <p>All the rivers of the besieged places.\u2014As the words stand, they suggest the thought that the Assyrian army could cut off the supply of water as well as provide it, and so connect themselves with the Rabshakeh\u2019s taunt in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTgzNDM=\">Isaiah 36:12<\/a>. Their true meaning, however, is probably, as in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTgwMTE=\">Isaiah 19:6<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\">Micah 7:12<\/a>, \u201cthe rivers or canals of Egypt,\u201d a form being used for Egypt which also conveys the idea of \u201cbesieged fortresses.\u201d So taken, the words are a defiant threat against Tirhakah. Not all the branches of the Nile in the Delta should protect his cities. His armies would, as it were, dry them up.<\/p>",
