This particle, authenticated by so many good vouchers, restores the sentence to its true poetical form, implying a repetition of some part of the parallel line preceding, thus:\u2014<\/p>\n\n <p>\"At the season of evening, behold terror! <\/p>\n\n <p>Before the morning, and [behold] he is no more!\" <\/p>\n\n <p> <em>That spoil us\u2014<\/em>, For <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05e9\u05d5\u05e1\u05d9\u05e0\u05d5 <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, shoseynu<\/span>, them that spoil us, fifteen MSS., one edition, and the Syriac have <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05e9\u05d5\u05e1\u05e0\u05d5 <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, shosenu<\/span>, him that spoileth us.

Though God may permit the wicked to prevail for a time against his people, yet in the end those shall be overthrown, and the glory of the Lord shall shine brightly on them that fear him; for the earth shall be subdued, and the universe filled with his glory. Amen, and Amen! <\/p>",
