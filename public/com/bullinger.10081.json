Laid, in the counsels of eternity: in Abraham\"s promise (Gen 12); in David\"s covenant (2Sa 7). <\/p>\n\n<p><em>in Zion.<\/em> In Zion; not Zion itself. <\/p>\n\n<p><em>a stone.<\/em> This is a distinct reference to <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NjYxXQ==\">Isaiah 49:24<\/a>. It is the Immanuel (of Isa 7), the promised Son (of Isa 9), the rod from Jesse\"s stem (of Isa 11). <\/p>\n\n<p><em>a tried stone<\/em> = a test stone: i.e. tested itself, and testing others. Compare <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTgyXQ==\">Isaiah 28:17<\/a>, and <a class=\"ref\">Zechariah 3:9<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n<p><em>a sure foundation.<\/em> Figure of speech <i>Polyptoton<\/i> (App-6), for emphasis. Hebrew a foundation founded: i.e. a wellfounded foundation, or a firm or sure foundation. <\/p>\n\n<p><em>not make haste<\/em> = be constant, steady, not fleeing away. See note on <a class=\"ref\">Proverbs 8:30<\/a>. Note the Figure of speech <i>Metonymy<\/i> (of Subject), by which the hastening, or flight is put for the confusion and shame which is the cause of it. Septuagint reads <em>\"ashamed\"<\/em>. In <a class=\"ref\">Romans 9:33; Romans 10:11. 1 Peter 2:6<\/a>, the Figure of speech is translated, and means therefore exactly the same thing: = shall have no need for hurried flight (Compare <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NjYwXQ==\">Isaiah 49:23<\/a>). <\/p>",
