    "html": "<p>In <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODY3OF0seyIxNzk3MSI6MTR9XQ==\">Isaiah 51:4&ndash;16<\/a>, great emphasis is placed on the pronouns <em>me<\/em> and <em>my:<\/em> &ldquo;my people,&rdquo; &ldquo;my nation,&rdquo; &ldquo;my judgment,&rdquo; &ldquo;my righteousness,&rdquo; &ldquo;my salvation,&rdquo; &ldquo;mine arm,&rdquo; &ldquo;my law&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODY3OF0seyIxNzgwOSI6MjJ9XQ==\">vv. 4&ndash;8<\/a>). The Lord emphasized these things to stress His relationship with us. He is our Creator, He is our Judge, He is our Savior, and He is our perfect Exemplar. And though the earth itself &ldquo;shall vanish away like smoke, and &hellip; wax old like a garment&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NjgwXQ==\">v. 6<\/a>), the qualities He claims for Himself will endure forever. God is permanent, stable, upright, and dependable. Those who trust in Him need not fear &ldquo;the reproach of men&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NjgxXQ==\">v. 7<\/a>) but should &ldquo;awake&rdquo; and &ldquo;put on strength &hellip; as in the ancient days&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NjgzXQ==\">v. 9<\/a>). This call is from God to His latter-day children to return to Him and &ldquo;come with singing unto Zion&rdquo; where &ldquo;sorrow and mourning shall flee away&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4Njg1XQ==\">v. 11<\/a>).<\/p><p>As do many other passages in the Old Testament, these verses bear strong witness that Jehovah, the God of the Old Testament, is the same person as Jesus Christ of the New.<\/p><p class=\"cite\">LDS Church Educational System Old Testament Student Manual, 1 Kings&ndash;Malachi, Religion 302, Chapter 17, Item 14<\/p>",
