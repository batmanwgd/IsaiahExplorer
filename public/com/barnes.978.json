The army was destroyed with the pestilence <a class=\"ref\">2 Kings 19:35<\/a>; but it fell as certainly as a forest falls before the axe.<\/p><p><em>And Lebanon<\/em>&mdash;Lebanon is here evidently descriptive of the army of the Assyrian, retaining the idea of a beautiful and magnificent forest. Thus, in <a class=\"ref\">Ezekiel 31:3<\/a> , it is said, &lsquo;the king of the Assyrians was a cedar of Lebanon with fair branches.&rsquo; Lebanon is usually applied to the Jews as descriptive of them (<a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 22:6, Jeremiah 22:23; Zechariah 10:10; Zechariah 11<\/a> :l), but it is evidently applied here to the Assyrian army; and the sense is, that that army should be soon and certainly destroyed, and that, therefore, the inhabitants of Jerusalem had no cause of alarm; see the notes at <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 37<\/a>.<\/p>",
