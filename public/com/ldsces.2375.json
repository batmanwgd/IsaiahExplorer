    "html": "<p>From time to time the Lord has led away remnants of Israel to &ldquo;isles&rdquo; from which He will eventually gather them before the Second Coming. The Americas are one of these isles. (see <a class=\"ref\">2 Nephi 10:20&ndash;21<\/a>; compare <a class=\"ref\">1 Nephi 19:10, 16; 21:8; 22:3&ndash;4; 2 Nephi 10:8<\/a>.) A study of these references reveals that these &ldquo;isles&rdquo; were not known by others (see especially <a class=\"ref\">1 Nephi 22:3&ndash;4<\/a>). Isaiah alluded to scattered Israel when he used the metaphor &ldquo;isles&rdquo; and suggested that there, in the isles, they would learn to trust Him and wait upon His word and be renewed together. All of this would come near the time of the harvest. (see <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODExMV0seyIxODQ1MyI6NX0sWzE4NjM4LDE4Njc5LDE4ODMxXV0=\">Isaiah 24:15; 41:1&ndash;5; 49:1; 51:5; 60:9<\/a>.) Then scattered Israel will learn a new song, the song of the redeemed, as they are gathered into the kingdom (see also <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODQ4NSwxODQ5MV0seyIzMDkyOCI6M31d\">Isaiah 42:4, 10; Revelation 14:1&ndash;3<\/a>).<\/p><p class=\"cite\">LDS Church Educational System Old Testament Student Manual, 1 Kings&ndash;Malachi, Religion 302, Chapter 16, Item 14<\/p>",
