    "html": "<p>             (16) From the uttermost part of the earth . . .\u2014The words \u201cglory to the righteous\u201d sound at first like a doxology addressed to Jehovah as essentially the Righteous One. Two facts militate, however, against this view. The word translated \u201cglory\u201d is not that commonly used in doxologies, but rather \u201chonour\u201d or \u201cpraise,\u201d such as is applied to men (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTc3MzY=\">Isaiah 4:2<\/a>; <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTgwODc=\">Isaiah 23:9<\/a>; <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTgxNjY=\">Isaiah 28:1<\/a>; <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODE2OSI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 28:4-5<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\">2 Samuel 1:19<\/a>). (2) The term \u201cthe Righteous One \u201cis never used absolutely as a name of \u2018God. On these grounds, therefore, it seems better to render \u201chonour to the righteous\u201d (comp. <a class=\"ref\">Romans 2:7<\/a>), to the true Israel of God as a righteous people. The \u201cuttermost part\u201d is, literally, the wing or skirt of the earth.<\/p>\n <p>But I said, My leanness, my leanness . . .\u2014The prophet is recalled from the ideal to the actual, from the glory of the future to the shame and misery of the present. \u201cLeanness,\u201d as in <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 22:17; Psalms 109:24<\/a>, was the natural symbol of extremest sorrow. In the \u201ctreacherous dealers,\u201d literally, robbers, or barbarians, we may find primarily the Assyrian invaders, who were making the country desolate, or the unjust rulers of Judah, who oppressed the people.<\/p>",
