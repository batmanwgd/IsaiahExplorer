Our joy at that time will be immense (9:3-7).<\/i><\/p> <p><i>The destruction of the Northern Kingdom of Israel during Isaiah's time, on ac- count of the pride, lack of love, social injustices, and general wickedness of its people (9:9-21), anticipated the devastation that awaits the wicked of our own day; as the Northern Kingdom's inhabitants were destroyed by wars, fire, and burning, so will be the devastation of those who work evil in the last days.<\/i><\/p> ",
