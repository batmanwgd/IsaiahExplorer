    "html": " <p>To call Jehovah&rsquo;s people and their leaders by the names Sodom and Gomorrah is to compare their moral degeneracy to that of those cities&rsquo; ancient inhabitants. As the leaders of a people generally reflect the people themselves, and as the political and ecclesiastical leaders of Jehovah&rsquo;s people parallel each other in the Book of Isaiah, their spiritual condition holds little hope for the rising generation. When things reach that point, Jehovah&rsquo;s people are fortunate indeed if Jehovah offers them a last warning. For those who accept it, there may yet be a chance of deliverance; otherwise, their destruction is assured. <\/p> <p> <em>Hear the word of Jehovah... give heed to the law of our God. <\/em> Knowing that Jehovah does nothing unless he reveals his secret to his servants the prophets (<a class=\"ref\">Amos 3:7<\/a>), he sends a warning voice before destroying his people. In the Book of Isaiah, that warning voice is Jehovah&rsquo;s servant, of whom Isaiah is a type. Pointing them to Jehovah&rsquo;s &ldquo;law&rdquo; and &ldquo;word&mdash;to the terms of his covenant&mdash;the servant directs them to the one thing that has the power to reverse their circumstances. Replacing current aberrant religious practices with keeping Jehovah&rsquo;s law and word remains his people&rsquo;s only hope. <\/p> ",
