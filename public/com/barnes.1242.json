Perhaps it refers to the efforts of this kind which they had made during their painful captivity of seventy years. There is no direct proof indeed, that during that time they attempted to revolt, or that they organized themselves for resistance to the Babylonian power; but there can be no doubt that they earnestly desired deliverance, and that their condition was one of extreme pain and anguish&mdash;a condition that is strikingly represented here by the pains of childbirth. Nay, it is not improbable that during that long period there may have been abortive efforts made at deliverance, and that here they refer to those efforts as having accomplished nothing. <\/p> <p> <em>We have as it were brought forth wind <\/em>&mdash;Our efforts have availed nothing. Michaelis, as quoted by Lowth, explains this figure in the following manner: &lsquo;Rariorem morbum describi, empneumatosin, aut ventosam molam dictum; quo quae laborant diu et sibi, et peritis medicis gravidae videntur, tandemque post omnes verae gravitatis molestias et labores ventum ex utero emittant; quem morbum passim describunt medici.&rsquo; (Syntagma Comment. vol. ii. p. 165.) Grotius thinks that the reference is to birds, &lsquo;Quae edunt ova subventanea,&rsquo; and refers to Pliny x. 58. But the correct reference is, doubtless, that which is mentioned by Michaelis. <\/p> <p> <em>Neither have the inhabitants of the world fallen <\/em>&mdash;We had no power to subdue them; and notwithstanding all our exertions their dominion was unbroken. This refers to the Babylonians who had dominion over the captive Jews. <\/p> ",
