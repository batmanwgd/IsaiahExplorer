    "html": "<p>In contrast to the terrible and total destruction decreed upon Babylon, as outlined in the previous chapter, this chapter opens with a declaration of hope to the once-downtrodden and scattered people of Israel. They shall be restored to their lands of promise and, more importantly, to their status as the covenant people of the Lord. Whereas the children of Israel, and perhaps more particularly those of Judah, had been despised and treated as second-class citizens or even slaves, they would now become the masters or the ruling class, so to speak.<\/p>     <p>In poetic fashion, the prophet Isaiah describes how the new position of power of these former servants will cause them to recite or sing a <i>taunt-song<\/i>(verses 4 21), which focuses on the now powerless position of their former persecutors. The king of Babylon is equated with Lucifer. Both held powerful positions at one time but both will ultimately be reduced to a state of nothingness. Judgment is also pronounced upon Assyria and Philistia. While much of this prophecy deals with ancient times, there are portentous portions that affect the last days, particularly those that relate to the demise and total dissolution of the devil's power on this earth.<\/p>",
