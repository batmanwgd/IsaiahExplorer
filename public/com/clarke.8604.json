    "html": "<p>The prophet, having intimated the deliverance from Babylon, and the still greater redemption couched under it, resumes the subject. He begins with the Divine vocation of Abraham, the root of the Israelitish family, and his successful exploits against the idolaters,<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODQ1MyI6N30=\">Isaiah 41:1-7<\/a> . He then recurs to the Babylonish captivity, and encourages the seed of Abraham, the friend of God, not to fear, as all their enemies would be ultimately subdued under them,<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODQ2MCI6OX0=\">Isaiah 41:8-16<\/a> ; and every thing furnished necessary to refresh and comfort them in them passage homewards through the desert,<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODQ2OSI6NH0=\">Isaiah 41:17-20<\/a> . The prophet then takes occasion to celebrate the prescience of God, from his knowledge of events so very distant as instanced in the prediction concerning the messenger of glad tidings which should be given to Jerusalem to deliver her from all her enemies; and challenges the idols of the heathen to produce the like proof of their pretended divinity,<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODQ3MyI6N30=\">Isaiah 41:21-27<\/a> . But they are all vanity, and accursed are they that choose them,<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDgwXQ==\">Isaiah 41:28<\/a> ,<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDgxXQ==\">Isaiah 41:29<\/a> .<\/p> ",
