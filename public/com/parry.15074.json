    "html": " <i>they shall hang upon him all the glory of his father's house.<\/i> The prophet may be presenting a word play; inasmuch as Christ <i>hung<\/i> on the cross to atone for the sins of mankind, even so will God \"<i>hang<\/i> upon him all the glory\" of his Father's kingdom. The phrase <i>hang upon him all the glory<\/i> may represent the robe of righteousness that will hang on Christ's shoulder, or the key of the house of David that will (symbolically) hang around his neck. One recalls similar expressions from Isaiah, such as \"and the government shall be upon his shoulder\" (9:6; 22:21-22) and the \"key&hellip;will I lay upon his shoulder\" (22:22).<\/p> <p><i>offspring and the issue.<\/i> This phrase pertains to Jesus Christ. Those who become part of Christ's spiritual family through his atonement will be his <i>offspring. <\/i>See 22:21 above, concerning Christ as the Father.<\/p> <p><i>vessels of small quantity\/cups\/flagons.<\/i> The varying sizes of vessels may be metaphors for members of Christ's spiritual family. A flagon is a large vessel, often with a handle and a lid.<\/p> ",
