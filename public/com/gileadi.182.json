As this is &ldquo;An oracle concerning Babylon&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MjgxLDE4Mjk5XQ==\">vv 1, 19<\/a>), we begin to discern Isaiah&rsquo;s definition of Babylon as both a people and a place&mdash;the &ldquo;earth&rdquo; and its &ldquo;sinners&rdquo; on the eve of their destruction (cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MjkxXQ==\">v 11<\/a>). In effect, as Zion is both a people and a place&mdash;those of Israel who repent and the place of their return (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NjgyLDE4MzMxXQ==\">Isaiah 1:27; 35:10<\/a>)&mdash;so is Babylon.<\/p>",
