It implies that at first Jehovah&rsquo;s <em>arm <\/em> is withheld or kept hidden from the world: &ldquo;He has made my mouth like a sharp sword&mdash;in the shadow of his hand he hid me. He has made me into a polished arrow&mdash;in his quiver he kept me secret&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NjM5XQ==\">Isaiah 49:2<\/a>). As Jehovah&rsquo;s coming to the earth draws near&mdash;as his people&rsquo;s <em>salvation <\/em> approaches&mdash;Jehovah empowers his servant to intervene on their behalf. <\/p> ",
