    "html": "<p><b>(<a class=\"ref\">1 Nephi 21:8<\/a>).<\/b>\"<i>Inherit the desolate heritages.<\/i>\" In considering these words, one would naturally think of the great promises made to Israel that she will inhabit and restore once-fruitful lands that have long lain desolate. (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODQ4XQ==\">Isaiah 61:4<\/a>.) There may, however, be a far more significant meaning attached to this phrase. During their long years of apostasy, have not the children of Israel been deprived of the heritage that might have been theirs had they been worthy? Thus, when they repent and return, will they not then inherit the heritage that has long been desolate?<\/p>",
