    "html": " <p> <em>I was wroth with my people\u2014 <\/em> God, in the course of his providence, makes use of great conquerors and tyrants as his instruments to execute his judgments in the earth; he employs one wicked nation to scourge another. The inflicter of the punishment may perhaps be as culpable as the sufferer; and may add to his guilt by indulging his cruelty in executing God's justice. When he has fulfilled the work to which the Divine vengeance has ordained him, he will become himself the object of it; see <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzg1NiI6OH0=\">Isaiah 10:5-12<\/a>. God charges the Babylonians, though employed by himself to chastise his people, with cruelty in regard to them. They exceeded the bounds of justice and humanity in oppressing and destroying them; and though they were really executing the righteous decree of God, yet, as far as it regarded themselves, they were only indulging their own ambition and violence. The Prophet Zechariah sets this matter in the same light: \"I was but a little angry and they helped forward the affliction;\" <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NjcwXQ==\">Isaiah 1:15<\/a>.\u2014L. <\/p> ",
