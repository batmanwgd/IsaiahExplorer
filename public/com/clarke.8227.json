    "html": "<p><em>The Lord Jehovah -<\/em>The word <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d9\u05d4 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">Yah<\/span>  read here is probably a mistake; and arose originally from the custom of the Jewish scribes, who, when they found a line too short for the word, wrote as many letters as filled it, and then began the next line with the whole word. In writing the word <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d4 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">Jehovah<\/span>, the line might terminate with <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d9\u05d4 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">Yah<\/span>, the two first letters; and then at the beginning of the next line the whole word <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d4 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">Yehovah<\/span>  would be written. This might give rise to <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d4 \u05d9\u05d4 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">Yah Yehovah<\/span> . The <span class=\"translit\">Yah<\/span>  is wanting here in two of Dr. Kennicott's MSS., in one ancient MS. of my own, and in the Septuagint, Vulgate, Syriac, and Arabic. See Houbigant and De Rossi.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>My song -<\/em>The pronoun is here necessary; and it is added by the Septuagint, Vulgate, and Syriac, who read <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d6\u05de\u05e8\u05ea\u05d9 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">zimrathi<\/span>, as it is in a MS. Two MSS. omit <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d9\u05d4 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">Yah<\/span>, see Houbigant, not. in loc. Another MS. has it in one word, <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d6\u05de\u05e8\u05ea\u05d9\u05d4 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">zimrathyah<\/span> . Seven others omit <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d4 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">Yehovah<\/span> . See  <a class=\"ref\">Exodus 15:2<\/a>, with Var. Lect. Kennicott.<\/p>",
