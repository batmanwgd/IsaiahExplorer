This does not mean that &ldquo;God&rdquo; is cruel, but that the &lsquo;day of Yahweh&rsquo; that was coming should be unsparing and destructive to them. It would be the exhibition of &ldquo;justice,&rdquo; but not of &ldquo;cruelty;&rdquo; and the word stands opposed here to mercy, and means that God would not spare them. The effect would be that the inhabitants of Babylon would be destroyed. <\/p> <p> <em>Fierce anger <\/em>&mdash;Hebrew, (\u05d7\u05e8\u05d5\u05df \u05d0\u05e3 &lsquo;aph cha\u0306ro\u0302n) &lsquo;A glow, or burning of anger.&rsquo; The phrase denotes the most intense indignation (compare <a class=\"ref\">Numbers 25:4; Numbers 32:14; 1 Samuel 28:18 <\/a>). <\/p> <p> <em>To lay the land desolate <\/em>&mdash;Chaldea, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3OTEyXQ==\">Isaiah 13:5 <\/a>. <\/p> ",
