    "html": "<p align=\"center\" class=\"subtitle\">             XXIX.<\/p> \n <p> (1) Woe to Ariel, to Ariel.\u2014The name belongs to the same group of poetic synonyms as Rahab (<a class=\"ref\">Psalms 87:4; Psalms 89:10<\/a>) and the Valley of Vision (<a class=\"ref\">Psalms 22:1<\/a>). It may have been coined by Isaiah himself. It may have been part of the secret language of the prophetic schools, as Sheshach stood for Babel (<a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 25:26<\/a>), Rahab for Egypt (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTg2ODM=\">Isaiah 51:9<\/a>), and in the language of later Rabbis, Edom, and in that of the Apocalypse, Babel, for Rome (<a class=\"ref\">Revelation 17:5<\/a>). Modern language has, it will be remembered, like names of praise and scorn for England and France, though these (John Bull, the British Lion, Crapaud, and the Gallic Cock) scarcely rise to the level of poetry. \u201cAriel\u201d has been variously interpreted as \u201cthe lion of God,\u201d or \u201cthe hearth of God.\u201d The first meaning has in its favour the use of the same word for men of special heroism in <a class=\"ref\">2 Samuel 23:20<\/a> (\u201c lion-like men,\u201d as in the margin, \u201clions of God\u201d), and perhaps in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTgyODc=\">Isaiah 33:7<\/a> (see Note). The \u201clion\u201d was, it may be noted, the traditional symbol of Judah (<a class=\"ref\">Revelation 5:5<\/a>). In the words that follow, \u201cthe city where David dwelt,\u201d the prophet interprets the mystic name for the benefit of his readers. The verb for \u201cdwelt\u201d conveys the sense of \u201cencamping.\u201d David had dwelt securely in the rock-fortress of Zion.<\/p>\n <p>Add ye year to year.\u2014The word implies the solemn keeping of the New Year festival. The people might keep that festival and offer many sacrifices, but this would not avail to ward off the tribulation which they deserved, and at which the prophet had hinted in the last verse of the preceding chapter.<\/p>",
