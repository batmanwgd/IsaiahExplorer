The subject of the verb ((<span class=\"translit\">'a\u0302mar<\/span>)) is not Jehovah; but the prophet intentionally leaves it obscure, as in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTg0MjQ=\">Isaiah 40:3<\/a>, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTg0Mjc=\">Isaiah 40:6<\/a> (cf., <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTgxMzM=\">Isaiah 26:2<\/a>).
