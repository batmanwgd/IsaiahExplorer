The subject of the verb ((<span class=\"translit\">,'a\u0302mar <\/span>)) is not Jehovah; but the prophet intentionally leaves it obscure, as in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDI0XQ==\">Isaiah 40:3 <\/a>,, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDI3XQ==\">Isaiah 40:6 <\/a>,(cf., <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTMzXQ==\">Isaiah 26:2 <\/a>). It is a heavenly cry; and the crier is not to be more precisely named. <br> <\/p>,",
