The first part of this unit (42:10\u201343:7) dealt with the certainty of Israel\u2019s deliverance from the Babylonian captivity. This second part shows how God will use that deliverance as the evidence that he alone is God. This material can be further subdivided into 43:8\u2013 44:5, which discusses Israel\u2019s role as a witness for God, and 44:6\u201320, the ultimate diatribe against the helplessness of the gods.<\/p>     ",
