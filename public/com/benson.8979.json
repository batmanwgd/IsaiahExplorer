He speaks of the prophecy contained in this and the two following chapters, which makes one continued discourse. \u201cThe first five verses of this chapter foretel the kingdom of the Messiah, the conversion of the Gentiles, and their admission into it. From the 6th verse to the end of this second chapter is foretold the punishment of the unbelieving Jews for their idolatrous practices, their confidence in their own strength, and distrust of God\u2019s protection: and, moreover, the destruction of idolatry in consequence of the establishment of the Messiah\u2019s kingdom. The whole third chapter, with<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3Njg3XQ==\">Isaiah 2:1<\/a> , of the fourth, is a prophecy of the calamities of the Babylonian invasion and captivity; with a particular amplification of the distress of the proud and luxurious daughters of Sion.<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzczNiI6NX0=\">Isaiah 4:2-6<\/a> , promises to the remnant, which shall have escaped this severe purgation, a future restoration to the favour and protection of God. This prophecy was probably delivered in the time of Jotham, or, perhaps, in that of Uzziah, to which time not any of his prophecies (and he prophesied in their days) is so applicable as that of these chapters.\u201d \u2014 Bishop Lowth.<\/p> ",
