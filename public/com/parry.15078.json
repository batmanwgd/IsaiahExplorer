The <i>ships of Tarshish<\/i> symbolize Tyre's people, and especially the merchants who, because of their wealth and prestige, represent the world's pride and arrogance (see commentary on <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzAyXQ==\">Isa. 2:16<\/a>). <\/p> <p><i>it is laid waste. <\/i>Tyre will soon be destroyed.<\/p> <p> <i>Chittim (Kittim). <\/i>Early name for Cyprus, an island colonized and controlled by Tyre. Since Tyre will be laid waste, so that there will be no house or harbor for people or ships to rest in, <i>Chittim<\/i> is an ideal location for Tyre's refugees, who will bring news of the destruction to Tyre's merchants who are traveling away from home.<\/p> ",
