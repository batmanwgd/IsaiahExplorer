The principal meaning of the verse seems to be, that this child, called Immanuel, should be brought up in the usual manner, \u201cthe same republic still continuing, and the cultivated fields, unoccupied by the enemy, abundantly supplying all necessary food; and that thus he should grow up to maturity.\u201d The words, however, also signify, that though he should be miraculously conceived, and should be possessed of a nature truly divine, yet he should be also<i>human,<\/i> subject to all the infirmities of our nature, standing in need of food for his support as other children do, and by the help thereof growing up from childhood to manhood. <i>That he<\/i><i>may know<\/i>\u2014Or rather, <i>till he know,<\/i> as<span class=\"hebrew_text\"> \u05dc\u05d3\u05e2\u05ea\u05d5<\/span> may be properly rendered;<i>to refuse the evil and choose the good<\/i>\u2014That is, till his faculties be fully unfolded, or, as Bishop Lowth renders it, <i>when he knows,<\/i> &c.; when they are unfolded, and he is arrived at mature age. Both in childhood and in manhood, he shall be sustained by the usual diet of the country, which, being neither invaded nor distressed by any foreign enemy, shall yield food sufficient for all its inhabitants.<\/p> ",
