In our day, the \"vessels of the Lord\" are those individuals who have taken upon themselves the name of the Lord through sacred covenants. They are the vessels or receptacles who have \"taken the Holy Spirit for their guide\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 45:57<\/a>), knowing that through transgression they \"withdraw [themselves] from the Spirit of the Lord, that it [has] no place in [them]\" (<a class=\"ref\">Mosiah 2:36<\/a>; see also DCE, 620).<\/p>",
