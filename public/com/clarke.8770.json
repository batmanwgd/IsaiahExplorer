    "html": " <p> <em>Sit down, O Jerusalem \"Ascend thy lofty seat, O Jerusalem\"\u2014<\/em>, The literal rendering here is, according to our English translation, \"arise, sit;\" on which a very learned person remarks: \"So the old versions. But sitting is an expression of mourning in Scripture and the ancients; and doth not well agree with the rising just before.\" It does not indeed agree, according to our ideas; but, considered in an oriental light, it is perfectly consistent. The common manner of sitting in the eastern countries is upon the ground or the floor with the legs crossed. The people of better condition have the floors of their chambers or divans covered with carpets for this purpose; and round the chamber broad couches, raised a little above the floor, spread with mattresses handsomely covered, which are called sofas. When sitting is spoken of as a posture of more than ordinary state, it is quite of a different kind; and means sitting on high, on a chair of state or throne called the musnud; for which a footstool was necessary, both in order that the person might raise himself up to it, and for supporting the legs when he was placed in it. \"Chairs,\" says Sir John Chardin, \"are never used in Persia, but at the coronation of their kings. The king is seated in a chair of gold set with jewels, three feet high. The chairs which are used by the people in the east are always so high as to make a footstool necessary. And this proves the propriety of the style of Scripture, which always joins the footstool to the throne.\" (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4OTI0XQ==\">Isaiah 66:1<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\">Psalm 105:1<\/a>.) Voyages, tom. 9 p. 85, 12mo. Besides the six steps to Solomon's throne, there was a footstool of gold fastened to the seat, <a class=\"ref\">2 Chronicles 9:18<\/a>, which would otherwise have been too high for the king to reach, or to sit on conveniently. <\/p>\n\n <p>When Thetis comes to wait on Vulcan to request armor for her son, she is received with great respect, and seated on a silver-studded throne, a chair of ceremony, with a footstool:\u2014<\/p>\n\n <p> <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u03a4\u03b7\u03bd \u03bc\u03b5\u03bd \u03b5\u03c0\u03b5\u03b9\u03c4\u03b1 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b8\u03b5\u03b9\u03c3\u03b5\u03bd \u03b5\u03c0\u03b9 \u03b8\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b1\u03c1\u03b3\u03c5\u03c1\u03bf\u03b7\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5,\ufffd\ufffd <-144 \ufffd\u039a\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5, \u03b4\u03b1\u03b9\u03b4\u03b1\u03bb\u03b5\u03bf\u03c5\u0387 \u03c5\u0314\u03c0\u03bf \u03b4\u03b5 \u03b8\u03c1\u03b7\u03bd\u03c5\u03c2 \u03c0\u03bf\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd \u03b7\u03b5\u03bd\u03c0<\/span>,. <\/p>\n\n <p> <i>Iliad 18:389. <\/i> <\/p> <i>\n\n <\/i> <p> <i><\/i>,\"High on a throne, with stars of silver graced, <\/p>\n\n <p>And various artifice, the queen she placed; <\/p>\n\n <p>A footstool at her feet.\" <\/p>\n\n <p> <i>Pope. <\/i> <\/p> <i>\n\n <\/i> <p> <i> <\/i> <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u039f\u0314 \u03b3\u03b1\u03c1 \u03b8\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd \u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03c5\u03b8\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u03b5\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b8\u03b5\u03b4\u03c1\u03b1 \u03c3\u03c5\u03bd \u03c5\u0314\u03c0\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03b4\u03b9\u03c9\u0345. <\/span> <\/p>\n\n <p> <i>Athenaeus, 5:4. <\/i> <\/p> <i>\n\n <\/i> <p> <i><\/i>,\"A throne is n othing more than a handsome sort of chair with a footstool.\"\u2014L. <\/p>",
