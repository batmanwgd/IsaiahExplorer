He begins by talking about the \u201cpath\u201d or way of life on which God calls the \u201crighteous\u201d to walk. It is not crooked or misleading. It is not filled with snares and traps. Instead, it is \u201clevel\u201d and \u201csmooth\u201d (26:7; cf. Moses\u2019 words in Deut. 10:12). God does not ask his people to do things that are bizarre or hurtful to themselves. He only asks them to live in the way they were made for.<\/p>     <p>\u2003The righteous gladly accept the way of God\u2019s \u201claws\u201d (mi\u0161patim, \u201cregulations\u201d) for two reasons. (1) It is the way in which believers express trust (\u201cwait\u201d) in the Lord. They do not say they trust God and then rush ahead to take care of themselves in ways that violate God\u2019s desires, his regulations for fruitful living. (2) God\u2019s honor and reputation have become the believers\u2019 deepest desire (26:8). They want to live in a way that will bring honor to him and not disgrace.<\/p>     <p>\u2003This thought is deepened in verse 9. \u201cMorning\u201d and \u201cnight\u201d the believer\u2019s passionate longing is for God. But the context makes it clear that it is not merely an emotional feeling that is wanted. Rather, it is the manifestation of God\u2019s character in one\u2019s life. The repetition of <em>mi\u0161patim;<\/em> (NIV \u201cjudgments\u201d) in this verse makes this clear. What Isaiah is praying for is the expression of God\u2019s regulations both in individual human lives and on the larger world scene. He is longing for the ethical evidence of God\u2019s presence to be unmistakably seen, because this is the only way \u201cthe people of the world\u201d will learn what is right.<\/p>     <p>\u2003Verses 10\u201311 express a profound truth. In the absence of repentance, \u201cgrace\u201d may be actually counterproductive. Unless the \u201cwicked\u201d experience the results of their having broken God\u2019s just regulations for life, his \u201cjudgments,\u201d they will persist in \u201cdoing evil.\u201d If they do not experience the consequences of their behavior, they will see no reason to change. The good of others means nothing to them. Thus, the prophet calls on God to demonstrate his justice to the wicked nations by redeeming his \u201cpeople.\u201d To be sure, many of God\u2019s people have sinned and brought God\u2019s wrath on themselves, as expressed through conquest by the nations. But the nations have not seen it in that way. They believe they have conquered Israel and Judah simply through their own power and glory, taking whatever they wanted in spite of the Lord (cf. Ezek. 36:18\u201320). Sooner or later, Isaiah says, God must demonstrate to the world that this is not the case. He must rise up against the wicked on behalf of his people and make the consequences of sin clear.<\/p>     <p>\u2003Verses 12\u201318 reflect further on this thought. The people have been unable to accomplish God\u2019s work in the world, and they call on him to demonstrate his delivering power there. This reflection begins with a testimony of his grace on their behalf in the past (26:12\u201315). Perhaps it is the period of the judges that is especially in the writer\u2019s mind, when God delivered his people from so many different overlords.<\/p>     <p>\u2003Verse 12 is a beautiful affirmation. God is the One who has done everything for his people. He has made it possible for them to have true \u201cpeace\u201d and to accomplish significant things. Apart from his grace and goodness, they would have been just one more insignificant people group in the ancient world.<\/p>     <p>\u2003Verses 13\u201315 then particularize what God has done in and though his people. He has delivered them from various peoples who have ruled over them at one time or another. Those people no longer have a \u201cname\u201d (i.e., an honorable memory, a reputation) in Israel, but God\u2019s \u201cname\u201d continues to be honored through all time among his people. The reason is that although Israel\u2019s enemies have made numerous attempts to wipe out the \u201cnation\u201d and enslave its people, God has frustrated them and \u201cenlarged the nation\u201d in spite of them. None of this is to the glory of Israel and its kings; it is all to the \u201cglory\u201d of God (26:15).<\/p>     <p>\u2003Verses 16\u201318 continue the previous theme, but the focus changes from the might of God to the helplessness of the people. Verse 16 is difficult, but the basic point seems to be that the people recognize that when the nations triumphed over them, it was because of God\u2019s \u201cdiscipline,\u201d not because of the power of the nations. They were helpless under that punishment. Like a woman with a false pregnancy, who goes into labor but has nothing to deliver, they struggled and struggled but were unable to deliver themselves or anyone else.<\/p>     <p>\u2003This last thought in verse 18 is an interesting one. We would expect it to say that they were unable to save themselves from the oppression of the world. But in fact the actual statement in both parts of the parallel appears to be that they have been unable to bring salvation into the world. The prophet is perhaps reflecting here on Israel\u2019s larger mission to be a blessing on the nations. This, of course, first appeared in God\u2019s promises to Abraham (Gen. 12:3). But, as we have seen, it is also a significant part of Isaiah\u2019s own message, which may explain its presence here. Not only does he long to see God\u2019s justice applied to the world in regard to Israel (26:9\u201311), he also wants to see God\u2019s salvation made available to the world through Israel.<\/p>     <p>\u2003Verse 19 is another example of a transition in Isaiah that can be read either with the preceding material or the following. In one sense it concludes what has just been said. In verse 18, the prophet, speaking for the people, has confessed their impotence in carrying out God\u2019s program in the world. They have failed him and been forced to submit to the discipline of destruction by the nations. They have been unable to recover from that discipline on their own. They are helpless, laboring as in childbirth but to no effect. But in verse 19 the prophet, speaking for God, tells them not to despair. Though years have passed and many of the faithful have died, with no effect either on the nation and the world, death does not have the last word; God does.<\/p>     <p>\u2003As in chapter 25, resurrection is seen as the final answer to all of earth\u2019s questions. If it were true that death conquers all, there would be no reason to live a life faithful and committed to God; it would make so little difference in the outcome of world events. But death does not conquer all. Those who have gone down into \u201cthe dust\u201d in death \u201cwill rise.\u201d \u201cThe earth\u201d will give up the \u201cdead,\u201d and then it will be demonstrated that the life of faith was not in vain.<\/p>     ",
