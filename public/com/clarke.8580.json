The king of Judah shows the messengers of Merodach-baladan all the treasures of his house and kingdom, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDE1XQ==\">Isaiah 39:2 <\/a>. The prophet takes occasion from this ostentatious display of the king to predict the captivity of the royal family, and of the people, by the Babylonians, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODQxNiI6Nn0=\">Isaiah 39:3-8 <\/a>. <\/p>,\n\n <p>Hitherto the copy of this history in the second book of Kings has been much the most correct; in this chapter that in Isaiah has the advantage. In the two first verses two mistakes in the other copy are to be corrected from this: for <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d4\u05d6\u05e7\u05d9\u05d4\u05d5 <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">,hizkiyahu <\/span>,, read <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d5\u05d9\u05d7\u05d6\u05e7 <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">,vayechezek <\/span>,, and was recovered; and for <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d5\u05d9\u05e9\u05de\u05e2 <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">,vaiyishma <\/span>,, he heard, read <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d5\u05d9\u05e9\u05de\u05d7 <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">,vaiyismach <\/span>,, he rejoiced. <\/p>,",
