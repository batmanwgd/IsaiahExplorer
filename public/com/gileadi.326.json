    "html": "<p>While &ldquo;they who walk uprightly shall attain peace and rest in their beds&rdquo; in Jehovah&rsquo;s Day of Judgment (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTg3Njg=\">Isaiah 57:2<\/a>), the wicked suffer deprivation and other covenant curses (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzcxNCI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 3:6-7<\/a>). In that context, Jehovah&rsquo;s &ldquo;act&rdquo; or &ldquo;work&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzU5LDE3ODYzLDE4NDMxLDE4NTcxLDE4ODY2XQ==\">Isaiah 5:19; 10:12; 40:10; 45:9; 62:11<\/a>) is twofold: (1) the destruction of the wicked; and (2) the deliverance of the righteous. As in this instance, the work&rsquo;s destructive aspect is &ldquo;unwonted&rdquo; or &ldquo;strange&rdquo; (<em>zar<\/em>). It is &ldquo;bizarre&rdquo; or &ldquo;alien&rdquo; (<em>nokriya<\/em>) because on this occasion Jehovah is &ldquo;stirred to anger&rdquo; and &ldquo;rises up&rdquo; against his own people instead of against their enemies.<\/p><p>Jehovah&rsquo;s rising up as he did on &ldquo;Mount Perazim&rdquo;&mdash;literally the &ldquo;Mount of Breakings Forth&rdquo;&mdash;harks back to his breaking forth upon his people who transgressed their bounds at Mount Sinai (<a class=\"ref\">Exodus 19:20-24<\/a>) and to his breaking forth upon Israel&rsquo;s enemies the Philistines (<a class=\"ref\">2 Samuel 5:18-20<\/a>). Jehovah&rsquo;s being stirred to anger &ldquo;as in the Valley of Gibeon&rdquo; refers to Joshua&rsquo;s victory over an alliance of Amorites, when the sun stood still upon Gibeon for an entire day until the Israelites had slaughtered them and Jehovah had helped them by casting great hailstones upon their enemies (<a class=\"ref\">Joshua 10:10-14<\/a>).<\/p>",
