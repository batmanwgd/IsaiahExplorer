The design is to express the fact that he was entirely alone in this work: that none were disposed or able to assist him. Though this has no direct reference to the plan of salvation, or to the work of the Messiah as a Redeemer, yet it is true of him also that in that work he stood alone. No one did aid him or could aid him; but alone he &lsquo;bore the burden of the world&rsquo;s atonement.&rsquo; <\/p> <p> <em>My fury, it upheld me <\/em>&mdash;My determined purpose to inflict punishment on my foes sustained me. There is a reference doubtless to the fact that courage nerves the arm and sustains a man in deadly conflict; that a purpose to take vengeance, or to inflict deserved punishment, animates one to make efforts which he could not otherwise perform. In <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODE3XQ==\">Isaiah 59:16<\/a>, the sentiment is, &lsquo;his righteousness sustained him;&rsquo; here it is that his fury did it. There the purpose was to bring salvation; here it was to destroy his foes. <\/p>",
