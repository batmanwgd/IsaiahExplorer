But as Tiglath-pileser carried the Reubenites and Gadites into captivity, (see <a class=\"ref\">1 Chronicles 5:26<\/a> ,) and made the country, which they had possessed, desolate, why may not the very Aroer, which was on the confines of Moab, be meant, and mentioned here, as Ephraim is in the next verse, as being confederate with Syria against Judah?<i>And none shall make them afraid<\/i>\u2014Because the land shall be desolate, and destitute of men who might disturb them.<\/p> ",
