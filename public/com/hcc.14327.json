A little before Christ's coming, they began to make more proselytes; (Matthew xxiii. 15.) and the sacred books being translated, came to the knowledge of the Gentiles, who were thus induced by degrees to embrace the true faith.  The road to heaven was always open for those who kept the commandments, (ver. 6.; Calmet) though they might not receive circumcision.  (Haydock) --- Christ has removed the wall of separation, (Ephesians ii. 14.; Calmet) and established <i>one fold<\/i> for all, John x.  (Haydock)<\/p>",
