    "html": "<p> (17) For peace I had great bitterness . . .\u2014The words in the Authorised Version read like a retrospect of the change from health to suffering. Really, they express the very opposite. It was for my peace (i.e., for my salvation, in the fullest sense of the word) that it was bitter, was bitter unto me (emphasis of iteration). All things were now seen as \u201cworking together for good.\u201d<\/p> \n<p>Thou hast in love to my soul . . .\u2014The italics show that the verbs \u201cdelivered it \u201care not in the present Hebrew text. A slight change, such as might be made to correct an error of transcription, would give that meaning, but as it stands, we have the singularly suggestive phrase, Thou hast loved me out of the pit of corruption. The very love of Jehovah is thought of as ipso facto a deliverance.<\/p> \n<p>Thou hast cast all my sins . . .\u2014As in our Lord\u2019s miracles, the bodily healing was the pledge and earnest of the spiritual. \u201cArise and walk\u201d guaranteed, \u201cThy sins be forgiven thee\u201d ( <a class=\"ref\">Matthew 9:2-5<\/a>). (For the symbols of that forgiveness, comp. <a class=\"ref\">Micah 7:19<\/a>.)<\/p> ",
