The \u201cchannels\u201d and \u201cbanks\u201d describe the intended course of that army as invading Syria and Israel; but it was to overflow those banks and sweep over Judah. In the former case, the kingdoms were to be utterly submerged as by the violence of the current. In Judah, it was to reach only \u201cto the neck,\u201d i.e., was not to work out so utter a destruction. Jeremiah (<a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 47:2<\/a>) reproduces the image. <\/p> ",
