He dwelleth in heaven, whence he can easily and irresistibly pour down judgments upon his enemies. <i>He hath fulfilled<\/i>\u2014Or, <i>he will fill Zion<\/i> \u2014<\/p> \n<p>Or Jerusalem;<i>with judgment and righteousness<\/i>\u2014That is, either, 1st, With a glorious instance of his just judgment against the Assyrians; or, 2d, With the execution of justice by good Hezekiah, and the practice of righteousness among the people, as before the same city was filled with impiety and injustice under Ahaz. The city shall not only be delivered from that wicked enemy, but shall also be established and blessed with true religion and righteousness; which was a great addition to that mercy. <i>And wisdom and knowledge<\/i>\u2014To govern thyself and the people well. The words seem to be addressed to Hezekiah, either by the prophet, or, as Bishop Lowth thinks, by a chorus of the Jews. <i>Shall be the stability of thy times<\/i>\u2014Of thy reign;<i>times<\/i> being often put for the things done in those times, The sense is, thy throne shall be established upon the sure foundations of wisdom and justice;<i>and strength of salvation<\/i>\u2014Thy saving strength, or thy strong and mighty salvation. <i>The fear of the Lord is his treasure<\/i>\u2014Thy chief treasure and delight shall be in promoting the fear and worship of God, which shall be a great honour and safeguard to thyself and people.<\/p> ",
