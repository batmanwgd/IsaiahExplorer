A stake is an ecclesiastical unit of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and covers a specific geographical area. According to the Lord, stakes are 'curtains or the strength of Zion' (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 101:21<\/a>). They are places where the Saints of God may be instructed more perfectly in the doctrines of salvation.\" (DCE, 559.) As the number of stakes increases, the influence of the protective tent expands to reach more of the earth's inhabitants. The ultimate goal is to stretch it over the entire earth, to gather all people under its protection.<\/p>",
