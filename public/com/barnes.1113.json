    "html": "<p><em>Neither shall there be any work<\/em>&mdash;The sense is, that there shall be such discord that no man, whether a prince, a politician, or a priest, shall be able to give any advice, or form any plan for the national safety and security, which shall be successful.<\/p><p><em>Which the head or tail<\/em>&mdash;High or low; strong or weak: those in office and those out of office; all shall be dispirited and confounded. Rosenmuller understands by the head here, the &ldquo;political&rdquo; orders of the nation, and by the tail the &ldquo;sacerdotal&rdquo; ranks. But the meaning more probably is, the highest and the lowest ranks&mdash;all the politicians, and priests, and princes, on the one hand, as the prophet had just stated <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODAxNiI6NX0=\">Isaiah 19:11-15<\/a> ; and all the artificers, fishermen, etc., on the other, as he had stated <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODAxMyI6M30=\">Isaiah 19:8-10<\/a>. This verse, therefore, is a &ldquo;summing up&rdquo; of all he had said about the calamities that were coming upon them.<\/p><p><em>Branch or rush<\/em>&mdash;See these words explained in the note at <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODQ0XQ==\">Isaiah 9:14<\/a>.<\/p>",
