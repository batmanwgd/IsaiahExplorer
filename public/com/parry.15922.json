    "html": " <p>These verses are a psalm of praise to God, sung about the pending marriage between Jehovah and his bride, the Church (<a class=\"ref\">Rev. 19:7-9<\/a>). The Church rejoices because the Lord has given her salvation and righteousness. Isaiah uses two analogies to demonstrate the blessings of the Lord. First, he compares the blessings of salvation and righteousness to the ornaments and jewels of a bridegroom and bride (61:10). Second, he compares the blessings of righteousness and praise to the buds and seeds that spring forth, without fail, from the garden after it has been sown (61:11).<\/p> <blockquote><i>I will greatly rejoice<\/i> <u>in the Lord<\/u>,     <br><i>my soul shall be joyful<\/i> <u>in my God<\/u>;     <br>for <i>he hath clothed me<\/i> <u>with the garments of salvation<\/u>,     <br><i>he hath covered me<\/i> <u>with the robe of righteousness<\/u>,     <br><i>as a bridegroom decketh himself<\/i> <u>with ornaments<\/u>,     <br>and <i>as a bride adorneth herself<\/i> <u>with her jewels<\/u>. (61:10)     <br>For <i>as the earth bringeth forth<\/i> <u>her bud<\/u>,     <br>and <i>as the garden causeth<\/i> <u>the things that are sown in it<\/u> <i>to spring forth;<\/i>     <br>so <i>the Lord God will cause<\/i> <u>righteousness and praise<\/u> <i>to spring forth<\/i> before all the nations.
