    "html": "<p>Crimes of injustice, typified by the administration of wrongful judgments, weigh heavily with Jehovah against his people. Giving or taking &ldquo;bribes&rdquo; or &ldquo;gifts&rdquo; (<em>sohad<\/em>) as personal favors for unjust decisions constitutes a betrayal of oneself and of the innocent victims it creates: &ldquo;When integrity is lacking, they who shun evil become a prey. Jehovah saw that there was no justice, and it displeased him. When he saw it, he wondered why there was no man, no one who would intervene&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODE2XQ==\">Isaiah 59:15-15<\/a>); &ldquo;He expected justice, but there was injustice; [he expected] righteousness, but there was an outcry&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzQ3XQ==\">v 7<\/a>).<\/p> ",
