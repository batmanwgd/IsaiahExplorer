The first noun has the definite article in the Hebrew, and the word, though commonly used of the unmarried, strictly speaking denotes rather one who has arrived at marriageable age. \u201cBride,\u201d in the old English and German sense of the word as applied to one who is about to become a wife, or is still a young wife, will, perhaps, best express its relation to the two Hebrew words which respectively and distinctively are used for \u201cvirgin\u201d and for \u201cwife.\u201d In<a class=\"ref\">Psalms 68:26<\/a> , the Authorised Version gives \u201cdamsels.\u201d The mysterious prophecy which was thus delivered to Ahaz has been very differently interpreted.<\/p> ",
