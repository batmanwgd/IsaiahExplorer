    "html": " <i>Before she travailed, she brought forth.<\/i> The Living Bible translates this passage as follows: \"In one day, suddenly, a nation, Israel, shall be born, even before the birth pains come.\" Isaiah's words make it plain that the creation of Zion is a miracle, as miraculous as would be the painless, effortless birth of a child. Suddenly and miraculously, it seems, a whole new society or a holy nation\u2014Zion\u2014is born. In viewing this same event, John the Revelator saw that there was indeed travail as the woman (the perfected \"church of God,\" or Zion) brought forth the man child (\"the kingdom of our God and his Christ\") (JST <a class=\"ref\">Rev. 12:1-7<\/a>). By combining Isaiah and Revelation, we come to this possible reading: \"Before Zion travailed to bring forth the multitude of her children, she travailed to bring forth the perfected kingdom of God, which will rule all nations with a rod of iron.\"<\/p> <p> <i>delivered of a man child.<\/i> Elder Bruce R. McConkie interpreted this passage as meaning the birth of the kingdom of God, which accords with Joseph Smith's translation of <a class=\"ref\">Rev. 12:7<\/a>. The headnote to <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isa. 66<\/a> in the LDS edition of the Bible identifies the child as \"Israel, as a nation,\" placing the event at the Second Coming.<\/p> ",
