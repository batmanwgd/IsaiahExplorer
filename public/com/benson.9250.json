Judah is guilty of the same sins with Israel, therefore they also must expect the same calamities, of which he speaks afterward. <i>The priest <\/i>\u2014 To whom strong drink was expressly forbidden in the time of their sacred ministrations; <i>and the<\/i> <i>prophet <\/i>\u2014 The teachers, who should have been patterns of sobriety to the people, and to whom sobriety was absolutely necessary for the right discharge of their office; <i>have erred <\/i>\u2014 In their conversation and in their holy administrations. <i>They are swallowed up of wine <\/i>\u2014 They are, as we say, drowned in it. <i>They err in vision <\/i>\u2014 The prophets miscarry in their sacred employment of prophesying or teaching, which is sometimes called <i>vision. They stumble in judgment <\/i>\u2014 The priests mistake in pronouncing the sentence of the law, which was their duty.<\/p>",
