And so Abendana on Sal. Den Melech: \"There are some who explain it thus: Upon what limb shall you be smitten, if you add defection? for already for your sins have you been smitten upon all of them; so that there is not to be found in you a whole limb on which you can be smitten.\" Which agrees with what follows: \"From the sole of the foot even unto the head, there is no soundness in it:\" and the sentiment and image is exactly the same with that of Ovid, Pont. 2:7, 42: - <\/p>,\n\n <p> <i>Vix habet in nobis jam nova plaga locum <\/i>,. <\/p>,\n\n <p>There is no place on you for a new stripe. Or that still more expressive line of Euripides; the great force and effect of which Longinus ascribes to its close and compressed structure, analogous to the sense which it expresses: - <\/p>,\n\n <p> <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u0301\u03b3\u03b5\u03bc\u03c9 \u03ba\u03b1\u03ba\u03c9\u03bd \u03b4\u03b7\u0387 \u03ba <\/span>,' <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u03bf\u03c5\u03ba\u03b5\u03c4 <\/span>,' <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u03b5\u03c3\u03b8 <\/span>,' <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u03bf\u0314\u03c0\u03b7 \u03c4\u03b9\u03b8\u03b7\u0345\u03c0 <\/span>,. <\/p>,\n\n <p>I am full of miseries: there's no room for more. <\/p>,\n\n <p> <i>Herc.
