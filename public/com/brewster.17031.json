(<a class=\"ref\">Romans 11:8<\/a>.)<\/p>     <p>In this respect, we should consider the response of Jesus to those who questioned why He spoke in parables: \"He answered and said unto them, Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them [the spiritually unprepared or asleep] it is not given.<\/p>     <p>\"For whosoever receiveth, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance; but whosoever continueth not to receive, from him shall be taken away even that he hath.<\/p>     <p>\"Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they seeing see not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand.\" (JST Matthew 13:10-13.)<\/p>",
