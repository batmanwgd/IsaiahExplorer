In <a class=\"ref\">Genesis 28:18<\/a> we have, at least, an analogous practice, which might easily become identical. Among the Ph\u0153nicians such stones were known as B\u0153tulia (probably a Grecised form of Bethel), and were connected with the worship of the reproductive powers of nature. As the true portion of Israel was emphatically Jehovah (<a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 10:16; Psalms 16:5<\/a>) there is an indignant irony in the word thus used. The idolaters had chosen a fetish instead of the Eternal One. In thy portion, we have the feminine singular, designating Israel as the faithless wife. <\/p> \n <p>Should I receive comfort in these?\u2014i.e., better, Should I be quiet in spite of all this?
