    "html": "<p>Jehovah&rsquo;s wife who has played the harlot finds herself bereft of her divine provider and protector. Like a widow in mourning, she sits on the ground grieving at the loss of her sons (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzMzXQ==\">v 25<\/a>). Commerce ceases as her ports of call lack traffic: &ldquo;Havoc remains in the city; the gates lie battered to ruin&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTA4XQ==\">Isaiah 24:12<\/a>). Self-centered instead of God-centered, she suffers the fate of Isaiah&rsquo;s Babylon category: &ldquo;Bereavement and widowhood shall suddenly overtake you, both in one day&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NjA5XQ==\">Isaiah 47:9<\/a>). Left destitute&mdash;a covenant curse&mdash;Jehovah&rsquo;s people must learn the hard way from whence their blessings come.<\/p> ",
