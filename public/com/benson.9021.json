See <a class=\"ref\">2 Peter 3:3-4<\/a>. <i>And sin with a cart-rope<\/i>\u2014With all their might, as beasts that draw carts with ropes. <i>That say, Let him make speed \u2014<\/i> Namely, God, in whose name thou and other prophets are always reproving and threatening us;<i>and hasten his work, that we may see it<\/i>\u2014He only thinks to affright us, as if we were fools or children, with bugbears, or pretended evils: he either cannot, or will not, do us any harm. This was the plain language of their actions; they lived as if they were of this opinion. <i>And let the counsel of the Holy One draw nigh<\/i>\u2014What you have declared to be his counsel, with regard to our going into captivity, and which, you say, his holiness obliges him to execute: they scornfully repeat the title of<i>Holy One,<\/i> usually given by the prophets to God. <i>And come, that we may know it<\/i>\u2014We cannot believe that it will ever happen unless we see it with our eyes. Thus, \u201cby a long progression in iniquity, and a continued accumulation of sin, men arrive at length to the highest degree of wickedness; bidding open defiance to God, and scoffing at his threatened judgments;\u201d to which they cannot be persuaded to give any credit till they find them executed upon them.<\/p> ",
