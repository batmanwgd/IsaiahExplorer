Or, more largely, thus: \u201cThough fury doth not belong to me, and vengeance be called my strange work, (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTg2XQ==\">Isaiah 28:21<\/a>,) yet if the briers and thorns, that is, the wicked and incorrigible, bid defiance to me, they will find I shall soon destroy and consume them like fire.\u201d <i>Or let him take hold of my strength,<\/i>,&c.\u2014Rather, let such a one return to me, and make his peace with me, by unfeigned repentance and living faith, <i>and he shall make peace with me <\/i>\u2014For I am always ready to receive returning sinners, and to pardon the truly penitent, who have recourse to me for mercy and salvation. <\/p>",
