    "html": "<p> (4) With righteousness shall he judge the poor . . .\u2014The picture which Isaiah had drawn of the corrupt judges of his time gives point to the contrast (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3Njc4XQ==\">Isaiah 1:23<\/a> ;<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzcwMCI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 2:14-15<\/a> ;<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzg1MiI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 10:1-2<\/a>). The poor whom they trampled on should be the special objects of the care of the true King (<a class=\"ref\">Matthew 11:5<\/a>).<\/p> \n<p>He shall smite the earth . . .\u2014The \u201cearth\u201d stands here, if we accept the reading, for the rulers who are for the time supreme in it. A slight alteration of the Hebrew gives shall smite the tyrant, which forms a better parallelism with the \u201cungodly\u201d of the next clause. The phrase \u201cthe sceptre of his mouth\u201d is significant. The word which the Messiah-King speaks shall be as the sceptre which is the symbol of authority. So in<a class=\"ref\">Revelation 1:16<\/a> , \u201ca sharp two-edged sword\u201d comes forth from the mouth of the Christ of St. John\u2019s vision. The latter clause, \u201cwith the breath of his lips shall he slay . . . ,\u201dhas a parallel in<a class=\"ref\">Hosea 6:5<\/a> .<\/p> ",
