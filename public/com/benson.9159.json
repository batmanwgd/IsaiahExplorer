Vitringa and others apply this to the time of the twelve kings, the anarchy that preceded, and the civil wars that ensued, in which Psammitichus prevailed over the rest; but it may, perhaps, be more properly applied to what agrees better, in point of time, with other parts of the prophecy, the civil wars between Apries and Amasis, at the time of Nebuchadnezzar\u2019s invasion; and the civil wars a little before the country was finally subdued by Ochus. It is no wonder, that in such distractions and distresses as these, the Egyptians, being naturally a cowardly people, should be destitute of<i> counsel,<\/i> and that<i> the spirit of Egypt should fail in the midst thereof,<\/i> as the prophet foretels, (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MDA4XQ==\">Isaiah 19:3<\/a> ,) and that, being also a very superstitious people,<i> they should seek to the idols, and to the charmers, and to them that had familiar spirits, and to the wizards.<\/i> But their divination was all in vain,\u201d God having determined that they should be subdued and oppressed by cruel lords and tyrants, as it follows.<\/p> ",
