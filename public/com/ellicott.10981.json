    "html": "<p> (12) How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning!\u2014The word for Lucifer is, literally, the shining one, the planet Venus, the morning star, the son of the dawn, as the symbol of the Babylonian power, which was so closely identified with astrolatry. \u201cLucifer\u201d etymologically gives the same meaning, and is used by Latin poets (Tibull. i., 10, 62) for Venus, as an equivalent for the ph\u00f4sphoros of the Greeks. The use of the word, however, in medi\u00e6val Latin as a name of Satan, whose fall was supposed to be shadowed forth in this and the following verse, makes its selection here singularly unfortunate. Few English readers realise the fact that it is the king of Babylon, and not the devil, who is addressed as Lucifer. While this has been the history of the Latin word, its Greek and English equivalents have risen to a higher place, and the \u201cmorning star\u201d has become a name of the Christ ( <a class=\"ref\">Revelation 22:16<\/a>).<\/p> ",
