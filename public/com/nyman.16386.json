The \"head\" (government) and the \"tail\" (false prophets) are identified in verse 15. The phrase \"and honourable\" is not given in the Book of Mormon as characteristic of the head. Under the government of Israel, the Lord's prophet was to instruct the king or the government leaders (for example, Isaiah taught Ahaz, as Nathan had taught David), but Israel's future prophets will cause her to err. The entire people will be hypocrites. The Book of Mormon phrase \"of them\" in verse 17, identifying the young men and the fatherless and widows specifically as hypocrites, points up the justice of God in not showing mercy to them.<\/p>     ",
