For, as Bishop Lowth observes, the Hebrew writers, \u201cto express happiness, prosperity, the instauration and advancement of states, kingdoms, and potentates, make use of images taken from the most striking parts of nature; from the heavenly bodies, from the sun, moon, and stars, which they describe as shining with increased splendour, and never setting; the moon becomes like the meridian sun, and the sun\u2019s light is augmented seven-fold: see <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MjQ0XQ==\">Isaiah 30:26<\/a>. New heavens and a new earth are created, and a brighter age commences. On the contrary, the overthrow and destruction of kingdoms are represented by opposite images; the stars are obscured, the moon withdraws her light, and the sun shines no more; the earth quakes, and the heavens tremble; and all things seem tending to their original chaos.\u201d<\/p> ",
