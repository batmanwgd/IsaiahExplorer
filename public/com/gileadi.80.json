Where agriculture still exists, the land fails to yield its increase for lack of rain (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzQ2XQ==\">v 6<\/a>). A ten-acre vineyard yields just one &ldquo;bath&rdquo; of wine, or five gallons. A &ldquo;homer&rdquo; of seed, or six bushels, yields only an &ldquo;ephah&rdquo;&mdash;less than a bushel. Just as Jehovah&rsquo;s people have produced inferior fruit spiritually (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzc0MiI6M30=\">vv 2-4<\/a>), so their land does physically (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 7:23-25; 17:4-6; 33:9<\/a>).<\/p>",
