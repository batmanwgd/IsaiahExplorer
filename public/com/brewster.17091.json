(<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDg3XQ==\">Isaiah 42:6<\/a>.) The addition of the words \"my servant\" in the Nephite text is significant. Who is the Servant who has been given as a covenant? None other than Jesus Christ! We take upon us the name of Jesus Christ in the waters of baptism and regularly renew that covenant when partaking of the emblems of the sacrament. (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 20:37, 75-79<\/a>.) The fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ is the \"new and everlasting covenant.\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 22:1<\/a>; DCE, 381-82.)<\/p>",
