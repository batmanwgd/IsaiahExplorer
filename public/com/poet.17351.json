    "html": "<p>After describing the exaltation of Zion and her growth through the influx of Gentiles (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isa. 62<\/a>), Isaiah explains in chapter 63 the destruction of Israel's enemies. In order for Zion to fill the entire earth, the enemies of righteousness must be displaced through the power of the Lord. After Isaiah prophesies concerning the Lord's power to cleanse the earth, he reminds Israel of what the Lord has already done and pleads with the Lord to bring about his promised salvation. Isaiah develops his major themes in chapter 63 and 64 as follows:<\/p> <p>A. Dialogue with Christ about his second coming (63:1-6)<\/p> <p>B. The Lord's former greater deed (63:7-14)<\/p> <p>C. Isaiah's intercessory prayer for Israel (63:15\u201464:12)<\/p>",
