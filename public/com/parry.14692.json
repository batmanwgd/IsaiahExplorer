Now briers and thorns overrun the choicest vine, and wild beasts enter the vineyard (because the hedge has been removed) and make it their habitation. Spiritually, the house of Israel (the vineyard) became a wasteland through apostasy and rejection of the kindnesses, love, and care of the Master of the vineyard, who is Jehovah. God would not have laid waste the vineyard had it been fruitful.<\/p> <p><i>briers and thorns.<\/i> Transgressions cause the land that we inhabit to become wasteland covered with <i>briers and thorns,<\/i> representing the fallen condition of the telestial world\u2014and of its inhabitants.<\/p> <p><i>clouds [will] rain no rain upon it.<\/i> Rain represents life, revelation, and the word of God.<\/p> ",
