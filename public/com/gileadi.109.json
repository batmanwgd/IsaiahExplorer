    "html": " <p>During Ahaz&rsquo; reign, when Isaiah couldn&rsquo;t prophesy directly, he did so indirectly by giving his sons portending names such as Shear-Jashub (<em>se&rsquo;ar yasub <\/em>), &ldquo;A Remnant Shall Repent&rdquo; or &ldquo;A Remnant Shall Return.&rdquo; Symbolic of the Davidic dynasty, the perpetual Gihon Spring&mdash;the &ldquo;Upper Reservoir&rdquo;&mdash;was the place where Davidic kings were anointed (<a class=\"ref\">1 Kings 1:33-39 <\/a>). Jehovah&rsquo;s message to Ahaz was thus to remind him of the Davidic Covenant. If he kept its terms, Jehovah would protect him and his people. If he didn&rsquo;t, only a repentant remnant of his people would survive a future calamity. <\/p> ",
