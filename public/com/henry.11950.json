And it is not in vain to wait for him; for the mercy comes at last, with abundant recompense for the delay. The hands once stretched out upon the cross, to make way for our salvation, will at length be stretched forth to destroy all impenitent sinners. Moab is here put for all adversaries of God's people; they shall all be trodden down or threshed. God shall bring down the pride of the enemies by one humbling judgment after another. This destruction of Moab is typical of Christ's victory, and the pulling down of Satan's strong holds. Therefore, beloved brethren, be ye steadfast, unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord; for your labor is not in vain in the Lord.\n <\/p> ",
