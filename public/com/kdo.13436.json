The meaning is: If ye would have any information or satisfaction concerning the future (\u201cthings to come,\u201d <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDc1XQ==\">Isaiah 41:23<\/a>; <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NTQxXQ==\">Isaiah 44:7<\/a>), about which ye can neither know nor determine anything of yourselves, inquire of me. <span class=\"normal hebrew\"> \u05e6\ufb35\u05d4<\/span> with an accusative of the person, and<span class=\"normal hebrew\"> \u05e2\u05dc<\/span> of the thing, signifies to commit anything to the care of another ( <a class=\"ref\">1 Chronicles 22:12<\/a>). The fault-finders in Israel were to leave the people of whom Jehovah was the Maker (a retrospective allusion to <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NTcyXQ==\">Isaiah 45:10<\/a> and <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NTcxXQ==\">Isaiah 45:9<\/a>), in the hands of Him who has created everything, and on whom everything depends. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NTc0XQ==\">Isaiah 45:12<\/a><i>\u201cI, I have made the earth, and created men upon it; I, my hands have stretched out the heavens, and all their host have I called forth.\u201d<\/i><span class=\"normal hebrew\"> \u05d9\u05d3\u05d9<\/span><span class=\"normal hebrew\"> \u05d0\u05e0\u05d9<\/span> , according to Ges. \u00a7121, 3, is equivalent to my hands, and mine alone - a similar arrangement of words to those in <a class=\"ref\">Genesis 24:27; 2 Chronicles 28:10; Ecclesiastes 2:15<\/a>.
