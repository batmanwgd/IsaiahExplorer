The same event is described by John in the book of Revelation (12:7-9) and by both Moses and Abraham in the Pearl of Great Price (see <a class=\"ref\">Moses 4:1-4; Abr. 3:27-28<\/a>). Many of the General Authorities quote these verses in this context (e.g., see Marion G. Romney, CR, Apr. 1971, p. 23). Isaiah's reference to Satan as a \"son of the morning\" is usually interpreted to mean that he was one of the early spirits born of our Father in Heaven; <a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 76:25-27<\/a> also refers to him by that name. His objective-to become God-is echoed by his followers, who are collectively described as \"that which... seeketh to become a law unto itself\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 88:35<\/a>). The Book of Mormon further describes Satan's objective: having been cast out and doomed to a miserable state forever, he seeks to make all men miserable like he is (see <a class=\"ref\">2 Ne. 2:17-18<\/a>). These verses in Isaiah are often quoted by modern Church leaders in reference to Satan's being cast out of heaven. Joseph Smith taught that Satan's punishment was being forbidden to have a body, and thus he and his followers go throughout the earth seeking to obtain the tabernacles of others (see TPJS, pp. 297-98).<\/p>     ",
