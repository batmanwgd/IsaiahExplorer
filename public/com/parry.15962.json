Speaking in our dispensation, the Lord said: \"Every corruptible thing,&hellip;that dwells upon all the face of the earth, shall be consumed; and also that of element shall melt with fervent heat\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 101:24-25<\/a>). <\/p> <p><i>make thy name known to thine adversaries.<\/i> The Lord's friends know him by covenant, by obedience, and by the still small voice of the Spirit. But the Lord's adversaries, who refuse these blessings, shall know him only by the power of his judgments. Isaiah asks the Lord to come with his burning fire so that all nations will know him and tremble at his presence.<\/p> ",
