    "html": "<p> But the possibility of repentance was still open to them, and at least a modification of what had been threatened was attainable. <em> \u201cAnd now drive ye not mockeries, lest your fetters be strengthened; for I have heard from the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, a judgment of destruction, and an irrevocable one, upon the whole earth.\u201d<\/em> It is assumed that they are already in fetters, namely, the fetters of Asshur (<a class=\"ref\">Nahum 1:13<\/a>). Out of these fetters they wanted to escape by a breach of faith, and with the help of Egypt without Jehovah, and consequently they mocked at the warnings of the prophet. He therefore appeals to them at any rate to stop their mocking, lest they should fall out of the bondage in which they now ere, into one that would bind them still more closely, and lest the judgment should become even more severe than it would otherwise be. For it was coming without fail. It might be modified, and with thorough repentance they might even escape; but that it would come, and that upon the whole earth, had been revealed to the prophet by Jehovah of hosts. This was the <em> sh e mu\u0304\u201ba\u0302h <\/em> which the prophet had heard from Jehovah, and which he gave them to hear and understand, though hitherto he had only been scoffed at by their wine-bibbing tongues.<\/p>",
