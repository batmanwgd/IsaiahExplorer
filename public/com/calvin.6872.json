    "html": "<p><i>What more ought to have been done to my vineyard?<\/i> He first inquires what could have been expected from the best husbandman or householder, <i>which he has not done to his vineyard<\/i> ? Hence he concludes that they had no excuse for having basely withheld from him the fruit of his toil.<\/p> \n<p><i>How did I expect that it would yield grapes?<\/i> In this clause he appears to expostulate with himself for having expected any good or pleasant fruit from so wicked a people; just as, when the result does not answer to our expectation, we complain of ourselves, and are angry at having ill-bestowed our labor on ungrateful persons whose wickedness ought to have restrained us from doing what we did, and acknowledge that we are justly deceived, because we were too simple and easily imposed on. But a more natural interpretation will be this: \u201cSince I discharged every part of my duty, and did more than any one could have expected in dressing my<i>vineyard<\/i> , how comes it that it yields me so poor a return, and that, instead of the fruit which was expected, it yields what is absolutely bitter?\u201d<\/p> \n<p>If it be objected that God had the remedy in his hands, if he had turned the hearts of the people, this is an idle evasion as applied to those men; for their conscience holds them fast, so that they cannot escape by laying the blame on another. Though God do not pierce the hearts of men by the power of his Spirit, so as to render them obedient to him, yet they will have no right to complain that this was wanting; for every pretense of ignorance is fully and abundantly taken away by the outward call. Besides, God does not speak here of his power, but declares that he was not under any obligation to do more than he did.<\/p> ",
