(Of course, in a broader sense, <i>my people<\/i> refers to all of the Lord's covenant people.) <i>Comfort ye<\/i> is repeated for emphasis, because Jerusalem's warfare will soon be over. Elder Orson Hyde was told by the Spirit, \"Go ye forth&hellip;and declare these words unto Judah, and say,&hellip;'assemble yourselves, and let us go into the defensed cities&hellip;. Speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem, and cry unto her, that her warfare is accomplished\u2014that her iniquity is pardoned, for she hath received of the Lord's hand doubly for all her sins.'\" <\/p> ",
