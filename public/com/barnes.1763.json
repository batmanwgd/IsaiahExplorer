    "html": "<p><em>For the Lord God will help me<\/em>&mdash;That is, he will sustain me amidst all these expressions of contempt and scorn.<\/p><p><em>Shall I not be confounded<\/em>&mdash;Hebrew, &lsquo;I shall not be ashamed;&rsquo; that is, I will bear all this with the assurance of his favor and protection, and I will not blush to be thus treated in a cause so glorious, and which must finally triumph and prevail.<\/p><p><em>Therefore have I set my face like a flint<\/em>&mdash;To harden the face, the brow, the forehead, might be used either in a bad or a good sense&mdash;in the former as denoting shamelessness or haughtiness (see the note at <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NjE5XQ==\">Isaiah 48:4<\/a> ); in the latter denoting courage, firmness, resolution. It is used in this sense here; and it means that the Messiah would be firm and resolute amidst all the contempt and scorn which he would meet, and would not shrink from any kind or degree of suffering which should be necessary to accomplish the great work in which he was engaged. A similar expression occurs in <a class=\"ref\">Ezekiel 3:8-9<\/a>: &lsquo;Behold, I have made thy face strong against their faces, and thy forehead strong against their foreheads. As an adamant, harder than a flint, have I made thy forehead; fear them not, neither be dismayed at their looks.&rsquo;<\/p>",
