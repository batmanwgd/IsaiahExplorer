    "html": "          <p>The late Dr. Sidney B. Sperry, who should be credited for helping members of the Church understand Isaiah, made the following comment about this verse:<\/p>     <p>In <a class=\"ref\">2 Ne. 12:16<\/a> (cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzAyXQ==\">Isaiah 2:16<\/a>) the Book of Mormon has a reading of remarkable interest. It prefixes a phrase of eight words not found in the Hebrew or King James versions. Since the ancient Septuagint (Greek) Version concurs with the added phrase in the Book of Mormon, let us exhibit the readings of the Book of Mormon (B.M.), the King James Version (K.J.), and the Septuagint (LXX) as follows:<\/p>     <p>B.M.         <br>And upon all the ships of the sea,         <br>and upon all the ships of Tarshish,         <br>and upon all pleasant pictures.<\/p>     <p>K.J.         <br>.............................         <br>And upon all the ships of Tarshish         <br>and upon all pleasant pictures.<\/p>     <p>LXX         <br>And upon every ship of the sea,         <br>.............................         <br>and upon every display of fine ships.         <br>&nbsp;<\/p>     <p>The Book of Mormon suggests that the original text of this verse contained three phrases, all of which commenced with the same opening words, \"and upon all.\" By a common accident, the original Hebrew (and hence the King James) text lost the first phrase, which was, however, preserved by the Septuagint. The latter lost the second phrase and seems to have corrupted the third phrase. The Book of Mormon preserved all three phrases. Scholars may suggest that Joseph Smith took the first phrase from the Septuagint. The prophet did not know Greek, and there is no evidence that he had access to a copy of the Septuagint in 1829-30 when he translated the Book of Mormon.
