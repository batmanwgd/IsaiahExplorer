Part of the Assyrian storm fell in Ahaz\u2019s reign, <a class=\"ref\">2 Chronicles 28:20 <\/a>; and he began to reap the bitter fruit of his confiding in the king of Assyria, rather than in the Lord of hosts. <i>Days that have not come <\/i>\u2014Namely, evil days, or calamities; <i>from the day that Ephraim departed, <\/i> &c.\u2014When the ten tribes revolted from thy father\u2019s house, and set up another opposite kingdom. The king of Assyria might well be called their plague or calamity, as he is called the <i>rod of God\u2019s anger, <\/i> <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODU2XQ==\">Isaiah 10:5 <\/a>. <\/p> ",
