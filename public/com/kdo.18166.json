    "html": "<p> The encouraging promise is continued in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzI4XQ==\">Isaiah 54:4<\/a> : <em> \u201cFear not, for thou wilt not be put to shame; and bid defiance to reproach, for thou wilt not blush: no, thou wilt forget the shame of thy youth, and wilt no more remember the reproach of thy widowhood.\u201d<\/em> Now that redemption was before the door, Israel was not to fear any more, or to be overcome (as the <em> niphal nikhlam <\/em> implies) by a felling of the shame consequent upon her state of punishment, or so to behave herself as to leave no room for hope. For a state of things was about to commence, in which she would have no need to be ashamed (on <em> bo\u0304sh <\/em> and <em> c ha\u0302phe\u0304r <\/em> or <em> hechp\u0131\u0304r <\/em> ), but which, on the contrary ( \u05db\u05bc\u05d9 , <em> imo <\/em> , as in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODU4LDE4NzUwXQ==\">Isaiah 10:7; Isaiah 55:9<\/a>), would be so glorious that she would forget the shame of her youth, i.e., of the Egyptian bondage, in which the national community of Israel was still but like a virgin (<em> \u201b alma\u0302h <\/em> ), who entered into a betrothal when redeemed by Jehovah, and became His youthful wife through a covenant of love (<em> ehe <\/em> = <em> b e r\u0131\u0304th <\/em> ) when the law was given at Sinai (<a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 2:2; Ezekiel 16:60<\/a>); so glorious indeed, that she would never again remember the shame of her widowhood, i.e., of the Babylonian captivity, in which she, the wife whom Jehovah had taken to Himself, was like a widow whose husband had died.<\/p>",
