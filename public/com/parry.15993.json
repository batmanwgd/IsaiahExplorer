(65:17)     <br>But be ye <i>glad<\/i>     <br>and <i>rejoice<\/i> for ever in that which I create:     <br>for, behold, I create <i>Jerusalem<\/i> a <u>rejoicing<\/u>,     <br>and <i>her people<\/i> a <u>joy<\/u>.

(65:20)     <br>And <i>they shall build houses,<\/i> and <u>inhabit them<\/u>;     <br>and <i>they shall plant vineyards,<\/i> and <u>eat the fruit of them<\/u>.
