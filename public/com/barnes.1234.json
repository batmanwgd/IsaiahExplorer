    "html": "<p><em>Let favor be showed to the wicked<\/em>&mdash;This is designed as an illustration of the sentiment in the previous verse&mdash;that judgments were needful in order that wicked people might be brought to the ways of righteousness. The truth is general, that though wicked people are favored with success in their enterprises, yet the effect will not be to lead them to the ways of virtue and religion. How often is this illustrated in the conduct of wicked people! How often do they show, when rolling in wealth, or when surrounded with the comforts of the domestic circle, that they feel no need of the friendship of God, and that their heart has no response of gratitude to make for all his mercies! Hence, the necessity, according to the language of the song before us, that God should take away their property, remove their friends, or destroy their health, in order that they may be brought to honor him. To do this, is benevolence in God, for whatever is needful to bring the sinner to the love of God and to the ways of virtue, is kindness to his soul.<\/p><p><em>In the land of uprightness<\/em>&mdash;Even when others are just and pious around him; when this is so much the general characteristic that it may be called &lsquo;the land of integrity,&rsquo; yet he will pursue his way of iniquity, though in it he may be solitary. Such is his love of sin, that neither the favor of God nor the general piety around him&mdash;neither the mercy of his Maker nor the influence of holy examples, will lead him in the way of piety and truth.<\/p><p><em>Will not behold the majesty of the Lord<\/em>&mdash;Will not see that which makes the Lord glorious in his dealings with people, so as to love and adore him. He is blind, and sees no evidence of loveliness in the character of God.<\/p> ",
