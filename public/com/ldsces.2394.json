    "html": " <p>In the first part of this verse Isaiah laid out contrasts: <\/p> <p>&ldquo;I form the light, and create darkness&rdquo; <\/p> <p>&ldquo;I make peace, and create evil&rdquo; <\/p> <p>Since the opposite of peace is sorrow or trouble, the translation from the New American Catholic Bible makes better sense: &ldquo;I form the light, and create the darkness, I make well-being and create woe.&rdquo; The idea is that the Lord is the author of peace, but that He also sends judgments upon the wicked who are ripe in iniquity. Therefore, even when the wicked are punished by the wicked (see <a class=\"ref\">Mormon 4:5<\/a>), it is under the direction of the Lord. <\/p> <p class=\"cite\"> LDS Church Educational System Old Testament Student Manual, 1 Kings&ndash;Malachi, Religion 302, Chapter 16, Item 33 <\/p> ",
