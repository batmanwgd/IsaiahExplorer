    "html": "<p>As Jehovah&rsquo;s instrument of punishment, the king of Assyria\/Babylon&mdash;Jehovah&rsquo;s <em>anger<\/em>, <em>fire<\/em>, and <em>sword<\/em>&mdash;constitutes an essential part of Jehovah&rsquo;s coming to the earth: &ldquo;Behold, Jehovah Omnipotent coming from afar! His <em>wrath<\/em> is kindled, heavy is his <em>grievance<\/em>; his <em>lips<\/em> flow with <em>indignation<\/em>, his <em>tongue<\/em> is like a devouring <em>fire<\/em>&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgyNDUiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 30:27<\/a>; emphasis added). The twofold nature of Jehovah&rsquo;s Day of Judgment thus means that the righteous are being delivered even as the wicked are being destroyed from the earth. To the very <em>fire<\/em> and <em>sword<\/em> that destroy the wicked, moreover, the righteous are immune:<\/p><p>&ldquo;Wickedness shall be set ablaze like a fire, and briars and thorns shall it consume; it shall ignite the jungle forests, and they shall billow upward in mushrooming clouds of smoke. At the wrath of Jehovah of Hosts the earth is scorched, and people are but fuel for the fire&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc4NDgiOjJ9XQ==\">Isaiah 9:18-19<\/a>; cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc2NjIiOjF9LHsiMTc3NjQiOjF9LHsiMTg2MTQiOjF9XQ==\">1:7; 5:24; 47:14<\/a>); &ldquo;Who among us can live through the devouring fire? Who among us can abide eternal burning? They who conduct themselves righteously and are honest in word&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgyOTQiOjJ9XQ==\">Isaiah 33:14-15<\/a>); &ldquo;Though you walk through the fire, you shall not be burned; its flame shall not consume you&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg1MDgiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 43:2<\/a>);<\/p><p>&ldquo;Your men shall be felled by the sword, your might [overthrown] in war&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc3MzMiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 3:25<\/a>); &ldquo;I will destine you to the sword; all of you shall succumb to the slaughter. For when I called, you did not respond; when I spoke, you would not give heed. You did what was evil in my eyes; you chose to do what was not my will&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg5MTAiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 65:12<\/a>; cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc2NzUiOjF9LHsiMTgzMDkiOjF9XQ==\">1:20; 34:5<\/a>); &ldquo;Whatever weapon is devised against you, it shall not succeed; every tongue that rises to accuse you, you shall refute. &lsquo;This is the heritage of the servants of Jehovah, and such is their vindication by me,&rsquo; says Jehovah&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg3NDEiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 54:17<\/a>; cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg0NjMiOjJ9XQ==\">41:11-12<\/a>).<\/p>",
