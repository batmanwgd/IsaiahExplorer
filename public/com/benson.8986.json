The corruption is universal, and the whole land is given to idolatry. <i>Therefore forgive them not \u2014 <\/i>Thou wilt not forgive them, the imperative being put for the future, as we have seen it frequently is in the Psalms. Vitringa, however, Dr. Waterland, and Bishop Lowth, with many others, consider this verse, not as describing their idolatry, but as a predicting the punishment which God was about to bring upon them for it; and therefore translate it, in perfect consistency with the Hebrew, in the future tense, thus: <i>Therefore the mean man shall be bowed down, and the mighty man shall be humbled; and thou wilt not forgive them. <\/i>\u201cThey bowed themselves down to their idols, therefore shall they be bowed down, and brought low, under the avenging hand of God.\u201d \u2014 Bishop Lowth. According to this interpretation, \u201cthe prophet begins here to describe the imminent severe judgments of God, wherewith he would punish the pride of these men, and their alienation from the true worship of God and their disobedience to his law.\u201d<\/p>",
