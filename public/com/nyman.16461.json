Words from the unsealed part of the record were to be given to \"another\" (Martin Harris) by the man to whom the book was delivered (Joseph Smith). The intentions of the learned were also foretold in Isaiah. The arguments regarding the authenticity of Martin Harris' visit will not be treated here; suffice it to say his story has been authenticated. He told one story and maintained it over the years, while Anthon told several contradictory stories (see B. H. Roberts, A Comprehensive History of the Church [Provo, Utah: Brigham Young University Press, 1965], 1:99-109). See the brief account given by Martin Harris (as recorded by Joseph Smith) which shows the literal fulfillment of this prophecy (<a class=\"ref\">JS-H 1:63-65<\/a>).<\/p>     <p>Joseph Smith said that the angel Moroni quoted many scriptures to him which were soon to be fulfilled (see <a class=\"ref\">JS-H 1:41<\/a>). Oliver Cowdery, in relating some of those scriptures, cited <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODIwNSI6NH0=\">Isaiah 29:11-14<\/a> as having been quoted by Moroni (see MA, Feb. 1835, p. 80). Moroni probably referred to the whole chapter. President Joseph Fielding Smith, along with many other General Authorities, proclaimed that the Martin Harris incident literally fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah (see DS, 3:213). Elder Mark E. Petersen noted the significance of Isaiah's referring to Joseph Smith as an unlearned man (see CR, Oct. <i>1977,<\/i> pp. 16-18).<\/p>     <p>The Book of Mormon shows the detail of the prophecy when it records that the Lord God would \"deliver <i>again<\/i> the book... to him that is not learned\" (<a class=\"ref\">2 Ne. 27:19<\/a>). It further shows that the Lord was giving an opportunity for the wisdom of the world to reject these words before he showed the world that he was not dependent upon the learned for the accomplishment of his purposes (see <a class=\"ref\">2 Ne. 27:20<\/a>). That the 2 Nephi reading was once in the original text of Isaiah is attested to by its presence in the JST.<\/p>     <p><b><a class=\"ref\">2 Ne. 27:21-23<\/a><\/b>. Joseph Smith also placed these verses, which concern the sealed section of the book (plates), in the JST.<\/p>     ",
