    "html": "<p> When this takes place, Zion will be seized with the greatest delight, mingled with some trembling. <em> \u201cThen wilt thou see and shine, and thine heart will tremble and expand; for the abundance of the sea will be turned to thee, the wealth of the nations cometh to thee.\u201d<\/em> It is a disputed question whether the proper reading is \u05ea\u05bc\u05e8\u05d0\u05d9 , \u05ea\u05bc\u05e8\u05d0\u05d9 , or \u05ea\u05bc\u05d9\u05e8\u05d0\u05d9 - all three point to \u05d9\u05e8 ) - or \u05ea\u05bc\u05e8\u05d0\u05d9 , from \u05e8\u05d0\u05d4 . The last is favoured by the lxx, Targ., Syr., Jerome, Saad., and all the earlier Jewish commentators except AE, and is also the Masoretic reading; for the <em> Masora finalis<\/em> (f. 1, col. 6) observes that this \u05e8\u05ea\u05d0\u05d9 is the only instance of such a form from \u05e8\u05d0\u05d4 (differing therefore from \u05ea\u05d9\u05e8\u05d0\u05d9 in <a class=\"ref\">Zephaniah 3:15<\/a>, where we also find the readings \u05ea\u05d9\u05e8\u05d0\u05d9 and \u05ea\u05e8\u05d0\u05d9 ); and there is a note in the margin of the Masora, \u05d7\u05d8\u05e3 \u05dc\u05d9\u05ea , to the effect that this \u05ea\u05e8\u05d0\u05d9 is the only one with <em> c hateph <\/em> , i.e., <em> Sheva <\/em> . Moreover, \u05ea\u05bc\u05e8\u05d0\u05d9 (thou shalt see) is the more natural reading, according to <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4OTM3XQ==\">Isaiah 66:14<\/a> and <a class=\"ref\">Zechariah 10:7<\/a>; more especially as \u05d9\u05e8\u05d0 is not a suitable word to use (like <em> pa\u0302chad <\/em> and <em> ra\u0302gaz <\/em> in <a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 33:9<\/a>) in the sense of trembling for joy (compare, on the contrary, \u05d9\u05e8\u05e2 , <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3OTY1XQ==\">Isaiah 15:4<\/a>, and \u05e8\u05d4\u05d4 in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NTQyXQ==\">Isaiah 44:8<\/a>). The true rendering therefore is, \u201cThen wilt thou see and shine,\u201d i.e., when thou seest this thou wilt thine, thy face will light up with joy; <em> na\u0302har <\/em> as in <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 34:6<\/a>. Luther render it, \u201cThen wilt thou see thy desire, and break out,\u201d viz., into shouting; Jerome, on the contrary, has, \u201cThou wilt overflow, i.e., thou wilt be inundated with waters coming suddenly like rivers.\u201d <\/p><p> The impression produced by this revolution is so overpowering, that Zion's heart trembles; yet at the same time it is so elevating, that the straitened heart expands ( \u05d5\u05e8\u05d7\u05d1 , a figure quite unknown to the classical languages, although they have <em> angor <\/em> and <em> angustia <\/em> ; the lxx renders it \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9\u0300 \u03b5\u0313\u03ba\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u0301\u03c3\u03b7 , after the reading \u05d5\u05e8\u05d4\u05d1 in Chayug, and Isaac Nathan in his <em> Concordance<\/em> , entitled \u05e0\u05ea\u05d9\u05d1 \u05de\u05d9\u05e8 ): for <em> ha\u0306mo\u0304n <\/em> <em> ya\u0302m <\/em> , i.e., everything of value that is possessed by islands and coast lands (<em> ha\u0302mo\u0304m <\/em> , groaning, a groaning multitude, more especially of possessions, <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 37:16<\/a>, etc.), is brought to her; and <em> c he\u0304l <\/em> <em> go\u0304yim <\/em> , the property, i.e., (looking at the plural of the predicate which follows; cf., <a class=\"ref\">Haggai 2:7<\/a>) the riches (gold, silver, etc., <a class=\"ref\">Zechariah 14:14<\/a>) of the heathen, are brought into her, that she may dispose of them to the glory of her God.<\/p>",
