The passage is striking as being an anticipation of the New Testament thought, that the Fatherhood of, God rests on something else than hereditary descent, and extends not to a single nation only, but to all mankind. Abraham might disclaim his degenerate descendants, but Jehovah would still recognise them. Implicitly, at least, the words contain the truth that \u201cGod is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham\u201d (<a class=\"ref\">Matthew 3:9<\/a>). He is still their Redeemer. The words may possibly imply the thought that, as in the case of Jeremiah (<a class=\"ref\">2 Maccabees 15:13-14<\/a>), and Rachel (<a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 31:15<\/a>), Abraham was thought of as watching over his posterity, and interceding for them. So, eventually, Abraham appears in the popular belief of Israel, as welcoming his children in the unseen world (<a class=\"ref\">Luke 16:22<\/a>).<\/p>",
