    "html": "<p><em>He who smote<\/em>&mdash;This may either refer to the king of Babylon, or to the rod or scepter which he had used, and which was now broken. Herder refers it to the scepter, &lsquo;that which smote the nations.&rsquo; (On the meaning of the word &ldquo;smote,&rdquo; see the notes at <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODcxXQ==\">Isaiah 10:20<\/a>)<\/p><p><em>The people<\/em>&mdash;The nations that were subject to his authority.<\/p><p><em>With a continual stroke<\/em>&mdash;Margin, &lsquo;A stroke without removing.&rsquo; Vulgate, Plaga insanabili&mdash;&lsquo;With an incurable plague.&rsquo;&mdash;Septuagint the same&mdash;&Pi;&lambda;&eta;&gamma;&eta;\u0342\u0345 &alpha;\u0313&nu;&iota;&alpha;\u0301&tau;&omega;\u0345 Ple\u0304ge\u0304 aniato\u0304. The Hebrew is, as in the margin, &lsquo;A smiting without removing,&rsquo; or without cessation. There was no relaxation in its oppressions, it was always engaged in acts of tyranny.<\/p><p><em>He that ruled the nations<\/em>&mdash;Babylon was the capital of a vast empire, and that empire was composed of many dependent nations.<\/p><p><em>Is persecuted<\/em>&mdash;By those that make war upon it. Its turn had come to be oppressed, and overthrown.<\/p><p><em>And none hindereth<\/em>&mdash;No nation opposes the invader. None of the dependent kingdoms of Babylon have any real attachment to it, but all rejoice at its downfall. The most mighty kingdom of the earth is helpless and ruined. What a change was this! How sudden and striking the revolution! And what a warning to proud and guilty cities!<\/p> ",
