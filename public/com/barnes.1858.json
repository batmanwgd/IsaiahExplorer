    "html": "<p><em>Yea, they are greedy dogs<\/em>&mdash;Margin, &lsquo;Strong of appetite.&rsquo; Literally, &lsquo;Strong of soul&rsquo; (\u05e2\u05d6\u05d9\u05be\u05e0\u05e4\u05e9\u05c1 \u201baze\u0304y-nephesh. Jerome renders it, Canes impudentissimi. So the Septuagint, &Kappa;&upsilon;\u0301&nu;&epsilon;&sigmaf; &alpha;\u0313&nu;&alpha;&iota;&delta;&epsilon;&iota;\u0342&sigmaf; &tau;&eta;\u0342\u0345 &psi;&upsilon;&chi;&eta;\u0342\u0345 Kunes anaideis te\u0304 psuche\u0304&mdash;&lsquo;Dogs impudent in soul.&rsquo; They were greedy and insatiable in that which the soul or the appetite demands. The idea here is, that the prophets to whom reference is here made were sensual, and disposed to gorge themselves; living only for carnal indulgence, insensible to the rights of others, and never satisfied.<\/p><p><em>And they are shepherds that cannot understand<\/em>&mdash;Who are ignorant of the needs of the people, and who cannot be made to comprehend what is needed by them (see <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzY0XQ==\">Isaiah 56:10<\/a>).<\/p><p><em>They all look to their own way<\/em>&mdash;That is, they are all selfish. The ministers of religion are set apart not to promote their own interests bug the welfare and salavation of others.<\/p><p><em>Every one for his gain<\/em>&mdash;For his own private ends and emoluments.<\/p><p><em>From his quarter<\/em>&mdash;Lowth, &lsquo;From the highest to the lowest.&rsquo; So Rosenmuller. Septuagint, &Kappa;&alpha;&tau;&alpha;\u0300 &tau;&omicron;\u0300 &epsilon;\u0314&alpha;&upsilon;&tau;&omicron;&upsilon;\u0342 Kata to heautou&mdash;&lsquo;Each one according to his own purpose.&rsquo; The Hebrew is literally, &lsquo;From his end,&rsquo; or extremity. <a class=\"ref\">Genesis 19:4<\/a>: &lsquo;From every quarter&rsquo; (\u05de\u05e7\u05e6\u05d4 m\u0131\u0302qqa\u0302tseh) that is, from one end to the other; one and all, the whole. This seems to be the idea here, that one and all were given to selfishness, to covetousness, and to indulgence in luxury and sensuality.<\/p>",
