God called him to his work for the benefit of Israel so that ultimately the world would come to the knowledge of God (45:6). The same principle holds when we receive divine calls: we are not called just for our own benefit. Joseph Smith taught: \"That we may learn still further that God calls or elects particular men to perform particular works, or on whom to confer special blessings, we read,&hellip;'For Jacob my servant's sake, and Israel mine elect, I have even called thee [Cyrus] by thy name,' to be a deliverer to my people Israel, and help to plant them on my holy mountain.\" <\/p> <p> <i>mine elect.<\/i> The elect are those who \"hear my voice and harden not their hearts\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 29:7<\/a>). They are \"holy and beloved\" (<a class=\"ref\">Col. 3:12<\/a>). They are people of faith (<a class=\"ref\">Titus 1:1; D&amp;C 84:33-34<\/a>). The elect are those who are righteous, who love the Lord with all their hearts, and, in the ultimate sense, have made their calling and election sure (<a class=\"ref\">2 Pet. 1:10<\/a>). <\/p> <p><i>surnamed thee.<\/i> The Hebrew word here (<i>kan<\/i><sup>e<\/sup>ak) can mean either a surname or an honorary title. Perhaps the Lord gave Cyrus the surname of Israel, adopting him into the chosen people (44:5), or perhaps the Lord was honoring Cyrus's own name for the work Cyrus would do.<\/p> ",
