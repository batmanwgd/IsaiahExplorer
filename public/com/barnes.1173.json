    "html": " <p> <em>Be still <\/em>&mdash;This is the description of a city which is destroyed, where the din of commerce, and the sound of revelry is no longer heard. It is an address of the prophet to Tyre, indicating that it would be soon still, and destroyed. <\/p> <p> <em>Ye inhabitants of the isle <\/em>&mdash;(of Tyre). The word &lsquo;isle&rsquo; (\u05d0\u05d9 &lsquo;iy) is sometimes used to denote a &ldquo;coast or maritime region&rdquo; (see the note at <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MDM2XQ==\">Isaiah 20:6<\/a>), but there seems no reason to doubt that here it means the island on which New Tyre was erected. This may have been occupied even before Old Tyre was destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar, though the main city was on the crest. <\/p> <p> <em>Thou whom the merchants of Zidon <\/em>&mdash;Tyre was a colony from Sidon; and the merchants of Sidon would trade to Tyre as well as to Sidon. <\/p> <p> <em>Have replenished <\/em>&mdash;Hebrew, &lsquo;have filled,&rsquo; that is, with merchandise, and with wealth. Thus, in <a class=\"ref\">Ezekiel 27:8<\/a>, Tyre is represented as having derived its seamen from Sidon: &lsquo;Theinhabitants of Sidon and of Arvad were thy mariners.&rsquo; And in <a class=\"ref\">Ezekiel 27:9-23<\/a>, Tyre is represented as having been filled with shipbuilders, merchants, mariners, soldiers, etc., from Gebal, Persia, Lud, Phut, Tarshish, Jayvan, Tubal, Mesheck, Dedan, Syria, Damascus, Arabia, etc. <\/p>",
