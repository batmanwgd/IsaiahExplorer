<small>FORM<\/small> the center section of the chiastic structure in which chapters 56\u201366 are arranged (see the comments at 56:1\u20138). These three chapters display the glorious future of a Jerusalem in which God\u2019s glory shines through his anointed Servant (61:1\u20133). That glory is an expression of the reality that will exist when the divine warrior\u2019s conquest of sin is complete. But even prior to that final consummation, many aspects of it have already been realized. God\u2019s light has dawned in Zion in the person of Jesus Christ; as a result, many of the world\u2019s great nations have come to Jerusalem. In the process many of the dispersed peoples of Israel have been restored to the land. From Jerusalem a witness has gone out to all the world, and that witness continues to this day.<\/p>     <p>\u2003Chapter 60 may be divided into four stanzas. (1) Verses 1\u20133 form a vividly poetic introduction. (2) Verses 4\u20139 focus on the return of Zion\u2019s dispersed sons and daughters, accompanied by the wealth of the world. (3) In verses 10\u201314 the kings of the oppressor nations submit to Zion. (4) Verses 15\u201322 demonstrate how God will not cast off Israel forever but will fully restore it to himself.<\/p>     ",
