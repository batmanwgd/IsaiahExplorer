It is hopeful and triumphant, describing the events of the last days leading up to the eventual exaltation of Israel and the second coming of Christ. Its significance is established by the fact that in addition to the Savior, at least four Book of Mormon prophets quote portions of this chapter: Nephi, Jacob, Abinadi, and Moroni. Seventy-five verses of additional scripture refer directly to or expound upon this chapter, and many other verses relate to it indirectly. Most important, the resurrected Savior Himself cites the words of <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 52<\/a> to teach the Nephites about covenant promises with Israel in the last days. Indeed, this is the most quoted chapter of Isaiah in the Book of Mormon. The main block of the chapter is found in <a class=\"ref\">3 Nephi 20:32&ndash;45<\/a>, within the last major sermon of Christ to the people at Bountiful. This passage and other segments of <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 52<\/a> recorded throughout the Book of Mormon are outlined in the chart below:<\/p>",
