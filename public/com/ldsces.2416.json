He showed that the beautiful garments symbolized the priesthood power restored to the house of Israel in the last days and that the loosing of the bands from her neck signified the removal of the curses of God. If Israel would return to God, new revelations would be given.<\/p><p>When the Savior cited passages from <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 52<\/a>, He omitted verses 4 and 5, perhaps these verses did not apply to the Nephites at that time (see <a class=\"ref\">3 Nephi 20:36&ndash;40<\/a>).<\/p><p class=\"cite\">LDS Church Educational System Old Testament Student Manual, 1 Kings&ndash;Malachi, Religion 302, Chapter 17, Item 16<\/p>",
