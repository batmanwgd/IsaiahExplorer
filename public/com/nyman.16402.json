The apocryphal book of 2 Esdras tells of miracles which will attend their return like those that attended their departure: \"Then they dwelt there until the last times; and now, when they are about to come again, the Most High will stop the channels of the river again, so that they may be able to pass over. Therefore you saw the multitude gathered together in peace.\" (2 Esdras 13:46-47.) And the Doctrine and Covenants gives an even more sure prophecy of the event spoken of in Isaiah (see <a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 133:26-33<\/a>). President Joseph Fielding Smith refers to the entire eleventh chapter of Isaiah in speaking of the lost tribes coming to their brother Ephraim, the firstborn in Israel, to receive their crowning blessings (see DS, 3:252).<\/p>     ",
