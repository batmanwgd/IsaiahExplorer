    "html": " <i>Arise\/shine\/glory.<\/i> Elder Orson Pratt said that this verse \"has reference to the latter-day Zion&hellip;. There is no one thing more fully revealed in the Scriptures of eternal truth, than the rise of the Zion of our God in the latter days, clothed upon with the glory of God from the heavens\u2014a Zion that will attract the attention of all the nations and kindreds of the whole earth.\" Verses 1 through 3 of this chapter contain a remarkable chiasm, which is quite clear in the King James Version but even clearer in a translation provided by Nils W. Lund :<\/p> <p>A. Arise,<\/p> <p>B. Shine,<\/p> <p>C. For thy light is come,<\/p> <p>D. And the glory<\/p> <p>E. Of Yahweh<\/p> <p>F. Upon thee is risen.<\/p> <p>G. For behold, darkness shall cover the earth,<\/p> <p>G. And gross darkness the people.<\/p> <p>F. But upon thee will arise<\/p> <p>E. Yahweh,<\/p> <p>D. And his glory upon thee be seen,<\/p> <p>C. And nations shall come to thy light,<\/p> <p>B. And kings to the brightness<\/p> <p>A. Of thy rising.<\/p> <p><i>thy light is come.<\/i> Israel had been groping in the darkness (59:10), but now the promised light is about to shine (58:8, 10). That light is Christ himself. It is also the true gospel restored to the earth by Jesus Christ. <\/p> ",
