    "html": " <p>As Isaiah emphasized Israel's punishment in the previous section, so his focus now is on Israel's redemption (43:1). The Lord provides us, members of the house of Israel, with great comfort and many promises. We, like ancient Israel, are promised safety as we pass through waters and rivers, fire and flames (43:2). We are comforted to know that Jehovah created us for his glory (43:1, 7)\u2014we are not upon this earth by chance. We are also comforted to know that the Lord has redeemed us (43:1) and that he is our \"God\" and our \"Savior\" (43:3). We are told that others have given their lives in our behalf, because we are \"precious\" to the Lord (43:4). Finally, the Lord promises to gather Israel's scattered seed from the \"ends of the earth\" (43:6).<\/p> <blockquote>But now thus saith the <i>Lord that created thee,<\/i> O <u> Jacob <\/u>,     <br>and <i>he that formed thee,<\/i> O <u>Israel<\/u>,     <br>Fear not: for <i>I have redeemed<\/i> <u>thee<\/u>,     <br><i>I have called<\/i> <u>thee<\/u> by thy name; thou art mine.

(43:2)     <br>For I am the <i>Lord thy God,<\/i>     <br>the <i>Holy One of Israel,<\/i>     <br>thy <i>Savior:<\/i>     <br>I gave <i>Egypt <\/i><u>for thy ransom<\/u>,     <br><i>Ethiopia and Seba<\/i> <u>for thee<\/u>.
