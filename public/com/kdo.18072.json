The profanation referred to was the fact that they were ruthlessly hurried off into a strange land, where their official labours were necessarily suspended. This was the fate of the leaders of the worship; and the whole nation, which bore the honourable names of Jacob and Israel, was give up to the ban (<em> c he\u0304rem <\/em> ) and the blasphemies (<em> giddu\u0304ph\u0131\u0304m <\/em> ) of the nations of the world. <\/p>",
