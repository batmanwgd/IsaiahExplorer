Here we have the character of such a king as cannot fail to be a blessing to the people.<\/p><ol><li> \"He sitteth on the throne in truth\" - He does not merely profess to be the father and protector of his people: but he is actually such. <\/li><\/ol><li> He is judging. He is not a man of war or blood, who wastes his subjects' lives and treasures in contentions with neighboring nations, in order to satisfy his ambition by the extension of his territory. On the contrary, his whole life is occupied in the distribution of justice. <\/li><li> He seeketh judgment. He seeks out the poor distressed ones who cannot make their way to him, and avenges them on their oppressors. <\/li> 4. He hastens righteousness. He does not suffer any of the courts of justice to delay the determination of the causes brought before them: he so orders that the point in litigation be fairly, fully, and speedily heard; and then judgment pronounced. Delays in the execution of justice answer little end but the enriching of unprincipled lawyers.",
