Being \"cut off\" is synonymous with being excommunicated or denied eternal increase (see 1 Nephi 22:20; D&amp;C 1:14; D&amp;C 132:19).  <\/p>  <p>  <b>2 Nephi 24:23. \"Possession for the bittern\"<\/b> Another reference to the drastic change that will come upon the land of Babylon. Instead of beautiful cities, it will be inhabited by the bittern, which has also been translated as \"owl,\" \"hedgehog,\" and \"porcupine.\" The \"pools of water\" refer to marshes or swamps. A \"besom\" is a broom.  <\/p>  ",
