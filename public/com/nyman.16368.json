A marginal note in the KJV shows the meaning of his son's name to be \"The remnant shall return.\" This meaning comes from the prophecy given by the Lord to Isaiah at the time of his call (6:13). The son's presence may have served either of two purposes. It may have been to remind Ahaz of the prophecy that Judah would not be utterly destroyed, or it may have been a reminder that the Lord had prophesied concerning Judah in order to prepare Ahaz for the prophecy which Isaiah was to deliver.<\/p>     <p>Their meeting at the \"upper pool\" may have not been coincidental either. Many biblical scholars have suggested that Ahaz was there inspecting the water supply and deciding how to protect it from the two invading forces. If this was the case, Ahaz's thinking on these matters would also prepare him to receive the prophecy Isaiah had been sent to deliver. <\/p>     ",
