    "html": "<p>The prophet sees Babylon&rsquo;s imminent destruction at the hands of Assyria and its allies. The &ldquo;traitor in the act of treachery&rdquo; and the &ldquo;destroyer laying waste&rdquo; identify the king of Assyria\/Babylon: &ldquo;Woe to you, despoiler, who yourself was not despoiled; O treacherous one, with whom none have been treacherous&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MjgxXQ==\">Isaiah 33:1<\/a>). Babylon&rsquo;s demise comes suddenly and with devastating force&mdash;like the devastation of tornadoes that leave nothing standing. Jehovah&rsquo;s Day of Judgment mercifully ends Babylon&rsquo;s oppressive civilization so that a new, millennial civilization may replace it (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODkxNyI6N30=\">Isaiah 65:19-25<\/a>).<\/p> ",
