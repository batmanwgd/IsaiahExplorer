    "html": "<p> Isaiah presents himself to his contemporaries with this older prophecy of the exalted and world-wide calling of the people of Jehovah, holds it up before them as a mirror, and exclaims in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NjkxXQ==\">Isaiah 2:5<\/a>, <em> \u201cO house of Jacob, come, let us walk in the light of Jehovah.\u201d<\/em> This exhortation is formed under the influence of the context, from which <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzY4OCI6M30=\">Isaiah 2:2-4<\/a> are taken, as we may see from <a class=\"ref\">Micah 4:5<\/a>, and also of the quotation itself. The use of the term <em> Jacob<\/em> instead of <em> Israel<\/em> is not indeed altogether strange to Isaiah (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxNzgyNV0seyIxNzg3MSI6Mn0sWzE4MjE3XV0=\">Isaiah 8:17; Isaiah 10:20-21; Isaiah 29:23<\/a>), but he prefers the use of <em> Israel<\/em> (compare <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3Njc5XQ==\">Isaiah 1:24<\/a> with <a class=\"ref\">Genesis 49:24<\/a>).With the words \u201cO house of Jacob\u201d he now turns to his people, whom so glorious a future awaits, because Jehovah has made it the scene of His manifested presence and grace, and summons it to walk in the light of such a God, to whom all nations will press at the end of the days. The summons, \u201cCome, let us walk,\u201d is the echo of <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3Njg5XQ==\">Isaiah 2:3<\/a>, \u201cCome, let us go;\u201d and as Hitzig observes, \u201cIsaiah endeavours, like Paul in <a class=\"ref\">Romans 11:14<\/a>, to stir up his countrymen to a noble jealousy, by setting before them the example of the heathen.\u201d The \u201clight of Jehovah\u201d (<em> 'or <\/em> <em> Jehovah<\/em> , in which the echo of <em> v'yorenu <\/em> in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3Njg5XQ==\">Isaiah 2:3<\/a> is hardly accidental; cf., <a class=\"ref\">Proverbs 6:23<\/a>) is the knowledge of Jehovah Himself, as furnished by means of positive revelation, His manifested love. It was now high time to walk in the light of Jehovah, i.e., to turn this knowledge into life, and reciprocate this love; and it was especially necessary to exhort Israel to this, now that Jehovah had given up His people, just because in their perverseness they had done the very opposite. This mournful declaration, which the prophet was obliged to make in order to explain his warning cry, he changes into the form of a prayerful sigh.<\/p>",
