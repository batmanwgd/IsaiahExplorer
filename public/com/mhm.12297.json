The \"sure mercies of David,\" which are promised here  (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTg3NDQ=\">Isaiah 55:3<\/a>),  are applied by the apostle to the benefits which flow to us from the  resurrection of Christ  (<a class=\"ref\">Acts 13:34<\/a>),  which may serve as a key to this chapter  not but that it was intended  for the comfort of the people of God that lived then, especially of the  captives in Babylon, and others of the dispersed of Israel  but unto us  was this gospel preached as well as unto them, and much more clearly  and fully in the New Testament. Here is,  I. A free and gracious invitation to all to come and take the benefit  of gospel grace,   <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTg3NDI=\">Isaiah 55:1<\/a>.  II. Pressing arguments to enforce this invitation,   <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODc0MyI6M30=\">Isaiah 55:2-4<\/a>.  III. A promise of the success of this invitation among the Gentiles,   <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTg3NDY=\">Isaiah 55:5<\/a>.  IV. An exhortation to repentance and reformation, with great  encouragement given to hope for pardon thereupon,   <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODc0NyI6NH0=\">Isaiah 55:6-9<\/a>.  V. The ratification of all this, with the certain efficacy of the word  of God,   <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTg3NTE=\">Isaiah 55:10<\/a>.  And a particular instance of the accomplishment of it in the return of  the Jews out of their captivity, which was intended for a sign of the  accomplishment of all these other promises.<\/p>",
