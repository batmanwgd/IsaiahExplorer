This fact is emphasized here twice\u2014first in the words of the Lord: \"Surely as I have thought, so shall it come to pass; and as I have purposed, so shall it stand\" (14:24), and again in Isaiah's explanation of the Lord's power to carry out his plans: \"For the Lord of hosts hath purposed, and who shall disannul it? and his hand is stretched out, and who shall turn it back?\" (14:27). God has always been in control of humanity's affairs; he is in charge of the present, and he holds the future in his hands. The Assyrians, for instance, were in God's control. They served his purposes by smiting the wayward Israelites, but then God in turn destroyed the Assyrians.<\/p> <blockquote> The Lord of Hosts hath sworn, saying:     <br>Surely as <i>I have thought,<\/i> <u>so shall it come to pass<\/u>;     <br>and as <i>I have purposed,<\/i> <u>so shall it stand\u2014<\/u>(14:24)     <br>That I will bring the Assyrian in my land, and upon my mountains tread him under foot;     <br>then shall <i>his yoke<\/i> <u>depart from off them<\/u>,     <br>and <i>his burden<\/i> <u>depart from off their shoulders<\/u>. (14:25)     <br><i>This is the purpose that is purposed<\/i> <u>upon the whole earth<\/u>;     <br>and <i>this is the hand that is stretched out<\/i> <u>upon all nations<\/u>. (14:26)     <br>For the <i>Lord of Hosts hath purposed,<\/i> and <u>who shall disannul<\/u>?     <br>And <i>his hand is stretched out,<\/i> and <u>who shall turn it back<\/u>?
