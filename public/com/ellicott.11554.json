God had been all along revealing Himself, not like the oracles of the heathen, in the gloom of caves and darkened shrines (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTc4Mjc=\">Isaiah 8:19<\/a>; <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTg5MDI=\">Isaiah 65:4<\/a>; <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTgxOTg=\">Isaiah 29:4<\/a>), but in the broad daylight of history and in the law written on men\u2019s hearts. He had bidden men seek Him not in chaos, but in a world of order, and to recognise His utterances by their righteousness.<\/p>",
