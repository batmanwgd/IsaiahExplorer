In the context of Isaiah's rebuke, it probably speaks of how the children of Israel had selfishly gone about pleasing themselves, rather than seeking to honor their God. They turned their backs on the God of Israel to make covenants with nonbelievers and agreements not in keeping with their faith. One of these covenants may have been the strongly forbidden practice of marrying those not of their faith.<\/p>",
