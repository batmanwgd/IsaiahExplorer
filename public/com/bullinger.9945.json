From a desire not to compete with \"Jerusalem\", which bore this name ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NjgxXQ==\">Isaiah 1:26<\/a>), it was altered to<i>cheres<\/i> , which in Chaldee = \"the sun\", or in Greek = \"Heliopolis\", which is the reading in many MSS., two early printed editions, and the margins of the Authorized Version and Revised Version But when the temple at Jerusalem was cleansed and restored, the temple at Heliopolis was deemed schismatic; and, by altering one letter (= CH, for = H), cheres (the sun) was altered to<i>heres<\/i> (destruction). Hence the present reading of the current Hebrew text.<\/p> ",
