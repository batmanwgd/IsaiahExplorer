(<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NTY2XQ==\">Isaiah 45:4<\/a>.) But this statement is much more forcible, because he speaks in what may be called an abrupt manner, and like a person awakened out of sleep, when he sees Babylon ruined, which formerly was wont to subdue other nations and trample them under her feet; and he shews that this happens for no other reason than that the Lord shews himself to be the \u201cRedeemer\u201d and defender of his people. <\/p>\n<p><i>The Holy One of Israel. <\/i>As if he had said, that not in vain hath he chosen this people, and separated it from other nations. In this transaction he intended to give a display of his power, and. on that account added to the title descriptive of his power, <i>Jehovah of Hosts, <\/i>the designation \u201cHoly.\u201d <\/p>",
