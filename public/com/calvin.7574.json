    "html": "<p><i>Thou shalt seek them. <\/i>That is, <i>if thou seek them; <\/i>for enemies are not sought, when they have been put to flight; and therefore I think that this future ought to be rendered as a subjunctive<i>, \u201cIf thou seek them, thou shalt not find them; <\/i>for they shall be destroyed and reduced to nothing.\u201d Here it ought to be observed that he describes two kinds of enemies, one, of those who attack us by open violence, the other, of those who attack us by words, that is, who tear us by slanders, curses, and reproaches, and who, as if they were defending a righteous cause, carry on various controversies with us, and summon us to courts of justice, and often accuse us of those crimes of which they have been guilty. But these are the stratagems of Satan, and we need not wonder that they who are his servants imitate their lord and master. The Prophet therefore mentions armed enemies who violently fight against the Church, and next brings forward wranglers, who annoy the Church by deceit and slander, and by false pretense of justice. We need not wonder, therefore, that such accusations are directed against us, and we ought not to think it strange, if many unprincipled men in the present day sell themselves to Antichrist to slander us; for the same thing happened formerly to prophets and other servants of God. <\/p>",
