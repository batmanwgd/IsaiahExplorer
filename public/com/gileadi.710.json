    "html": "<p>Unreality characterizes the petitions of those who suffer covenant curses as they portray Jehovah as an aloof God who dwells in glory high in the heavens while they&mdash;his children&mdash;live in despair here below. Although they know that Jehovah at times intervenes on behalf of his people to deliver them from perils, they overlook the covenantal conditions under which he does so. They want redemption, but on their own terms. Meanwhile, Jehovah&rsquo;s<em>zeal<\/em>&mdash;as manifested in his servant&mdash;is absent, having left in the new exodus with God&rsquo;s sons and daughters who emulated their righteous ancestors.<\/p> ",
