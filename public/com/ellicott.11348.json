In 2 Kings 18; 2 Chronicles 32, we have the previous history of the war. Hezekiah, on hearing Sennacherib\u2019s reproach, began to strengthen the fortifications of Jerusalem, called his officers and troops together, and made an appeal to their faith and courage. In Isaiah 22 we have the prophet\u2019s view of those preparations. Probably by Isaiah\u2019s advice, who put no confidence in this boastful and blustering courage, Hezekiah sent to Sennacherib, who was then besieging Lachish, to sue for peace, acknowledging that he had offended. A penalty of three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold was imposed and paid, Hezekiah being reduced to empty his own treasury and that of the Temple, and even to strip the Temple doors and pillars of the plates of gold with which they were overlaid. Peace, however, was not to be had even at that price. Encouraged, perhaps, by this prompt submission, and tearing up the treaty (the breach of covenant of which Isaiah complains in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MzIyXQ==\">Isaiah 35:1<\/a>), Sennacherib sent his officers, the Tartan, the Rabsaris, and the Rabshakeh (the names are all official titles) to demand an unconditional surrender.<\/p>\n <p>He stood by the conduit of the upper pool.\u2014The spot was the same as that at which Isaiah had addressed Ahaz thirty or more years before (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3Nzg2XQ==\">Isaiah 7:3<\/a>). It was probably chosen by the Rabshakeh as commanding one end of the aqueduct which supplied the city with water, and thus enabling him to threaten that he\u00b7 would cut off the supply (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MzQzXQ==\">Isaiah 36:12<\/a>).<\/p>",
