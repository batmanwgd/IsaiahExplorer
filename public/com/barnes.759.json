The objection would be, that they were strict in the duties of their religion, and that they even abounded in offering victims of sacrifice. God replies in this and the following verses, that all this would be of no use, and would meet with no acceptance, unless it were the offering of the heart. He demanded righteousness; and without that, all external offerings would be vain. The same sentiment often occurs in the Old Testament.<\/p><p>Hath Jehovah as great delight in burnt-offerings and sacrifices<\/p><p>As in obeying the voice of the Lord?<\/p><p>Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice,<\/p><p>And to hearken than the fat of rams.<\/p> ",
