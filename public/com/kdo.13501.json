    "html": "<p>This general law of His action is most especially the law of His conduct towards Israel, in which such grievous effects of its well-deserved punishment are apparent, and effects so different from those intended, that the compassion of God feels impelled to put an end to the punishment for the good of all that are susceptible of salvation. <i>\u201cAnd because of the iniquity of its selfishness, I was wroth, and smote it; hiding myself, and being angry: then it went on, turning away in the way of its own heart. I have seen its ways, and will heal it; and will lead it, and afford consolations to it, and to its mourning ones.\u201d<\/i> The fundamental and chief sin of Israel is here called <span class=\"normal hebrew\">\ufb31\u05e6\u05e2<\/span>, lit., a cut of slice (= gain, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzY1XQ==\">Isaiah 56:11<\/a>); then, like <span class=\"greek normal\"> \u03c0\u03bb\u03b5\u03bf\u03bd\u03b5\u03be\u03b9\u0301\u03b1 <\/span>, which is \u201cidolatry\u201d according to <a class=\"ref\">Colossians 3:5<\/a>, or like <span class=\"greek normal\"> \u03c6\u03b9\u03bb\u03b1\u03c1\u03b3\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u0301\u03b1 <\/span>, which is \u201cthe root of all evil\u201d according to <a class=\"ref\">1 Timothy 6:10<\/a>, greedy desire for worldly possession, self-seeking, or worldliness generally. The future <span class=\"normal hebrew\">\u05d5\u05d0\ufb3b\u05d4\ufb35<\/span>, standing as it does by the side of the perfect here, indicates that which is also past; and <span class=\"normal hebrew\">\u05d5\u05d0\u05e7\u05e6\u05e3<\/span> stands in the place of a second gerund: <i>abscondendo<\/i> (viz., <i>(<span class=\"translit\">pa\u0302nai<\/span>), my face, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzMyXQ==\">Isaiah 54:8<\/a>) <i>et stomachando<\/i>.
