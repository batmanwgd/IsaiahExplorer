When he says, \u201cEven to old age,\u201d it might be thought absurd; for we ought to become full-grown men after having been carried by God from infancy. But if any one shall examine it properly, it will be found that we never make so great progress as not to need to be upheld by the strength of God, for otherwise the most perfect man would stumble every moment; as David also testifies,<\/p> \n<p>\u201cForsake me not in the time of old age, withdraw not from me when my strength faileth.\u201d (<a class=\"ref\">Psalms 71:9<\/a> .)<\/p> \n<p><i> I have made and will carry.<\/i> He again argues in the same manner. God does not regard what we deserve, but continues his grace toward us; and therefore we ought to draw confidence from it, \u201cThou didst createus, not only that we might be human beings, but that we might be thy children; and therefore thou wilt continue till the end to exercise continually toward us the care of a father and of a mother.\u201d<\/p> ",
