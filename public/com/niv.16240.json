section (44:23\u2013 46:13) appears to me to be a two-part unit introduced by a call to praise, in which the plan of God involving his servants (44:23\u201345:13) is followed by a declaration of God\u2019s absolute superiority over the idols (45:14\u2013 46:13). I will discuss the two parts separately, but I believe the basic line of thought continues throughout.<\/p>     <p>\u2003In 44:23\u201345:13, God reveals the name of the person who will be his \u201canointed\u201d to deliver his people from the Babylonian exile. After the opening call to praise (44:23), the prophet celebrates God\u2019s power to do as he wishes, concluding with the announcement of Cyrus\u2019s name (44:24\u201328). Then follows God\u2019s commission to Cyrus (45:1\u20138). Finally, in response to an apparent challenge to the appropriateness of using a pagan in this way, God asserts that he has a perfect right to do this if he chooses (45:9\u201313). Hanson points out the prominence of first-person pronouns and verbs referring to God in the section. Although the naming of Cyrus is the dramatic center, the passage is about God, not Cyrus.<\/p>     ",
