One is reminded of similar language being applied to the seemingly forsaken prophet of God unjustly languishing in Liberty Jail in the winter of 1838-39: \"My son,\" declared the voice of Israel's Husband, \"peace be unto thy soul; thine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment.\"<\/p>     <p>The Lord then added this comforting promise, which could well apply to the repentant wife of whom Isaiah prophesied: \"And then, if thou endure it well, God shall exalt thee on high; thou shalt triumph over all thy foes.\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 121:7-8<\/a>.)<\/p>",
