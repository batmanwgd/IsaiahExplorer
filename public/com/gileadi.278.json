    "html": "<p>It was the residents of Babylon&mdash;&ldquo;the land of the Chaldeans&rdquo;&mdash;who established the world&rsquo;s seaports that Tyre symbolizes. As Jehovah&rsquo;s Day of Judgment approaches, the Assyrians install surveillance devices to spy out Tyre&rsquo;s strengths and weaknesses. When Assyria launches its destructive assault, Tyre&mdash;like all of Greater Babylon&mdash;experiences &ldquo;downfall&rdquo; or &ldquo;ruin&rdquo; (<em>mappela<\/em>) ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NjExXQ==\">Isaiah 47:11<\/a>). With no place to dock, Tyre&rsquo;s merchantmen flounder at sea, their calls for help going unheeded: &ldquo;Jehovah of Hosts has a day in store.... against [all vessels at sea,] both merchant ships and pleasure craft&rdquo; ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3Njk4LDE3NzAyXQ==\">Isaiah 2:12, 16<\/a>).<\/p> ",
