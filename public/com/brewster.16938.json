It is an invitation to repent and be baptized; or, as the apostle Paul would later proclaim, to put off old (sinful) ways and put on a new (cleansed) body whereby we would then \"walk in newness of life.\" (See <a class=\"ref\">Romans 6<\/a>.) The sure promise of Him who is the source of \"living water\" (<a class=\"ref\">John 4:10<\/a>) is this: \"I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely.\" (<a class=\"ref\">Revelation 21:6<\/a>.)<\/p>",
