The symbol of the razor refers to the fact that the Assyrians forced war prisoners to become slaves, humiliating and dishonoring them by shaving them from head to toe. Hence the fly and bee metaphors in 7:18 and the razor metaphor foretell that \"no part of the land (7:18-19), no part of the person (7:20) will be free of enemy occupation.\" <\/p> ",
