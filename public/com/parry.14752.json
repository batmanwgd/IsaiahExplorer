The <i>Lord shall whistle<\/i> to the bees is a symbol built on an actual ancient practice, for Cyrillus of Alexandria (ca. a.d. 400) wrote about beekeepers who whistled to bees to get them to return to their hives. <\/p> <p><i>fly\/bee.<\/i> These refer to fighting soldiers (see <a class=\"ref\">Deut. 1:44; Ps. 118:12<\/a>). These symbols are well chosen, for \"the flooding of the Nile brought&hellip;swarms of flies&hellip;. The hill districts of Assyria were well known for their bees.\" <\/p> <p><i>rivers of Egypt\/land of Assyria.<\/i> Assyria's domination and power would reach as far south as the rivers of Egypt, and Assyria would even rule Egypt for a brief period during the following century.<\/p> ",
