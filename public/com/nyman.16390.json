Assyria is a good example of this principle taught by the Prophet Joseph Smith. Although there is nothing said about Assyria's being given the opportunity to keep the commandments of God in these verses, when the full history is known it will undoubtedly show that Assyria did have that opportunity. This conclusion is drawn from the allegory of Zenos in <a class=\"ref\">Jacob 5<\/a>, which outlines the history of the house of Israel. The wild olive branches are the Gentiles, who are to be grafted into the tree of Israel and given the opportunity to bear fruit. That some did bear fruit from this graft is shown by the Savior's declaration to his disciples to harvest the fruit among the Samaritans (see <a class=\"ref\">John 4:31-38<\/a>), who were in part a product of the Assyrian conquest as the Assyrians brought Babylonians and others into Samaria.<\/p>     ",
