The <i>days of one king<\/i> are said to be seventy years.<\/p> <p><i>as the song of the harlot. <\/i>This may be a street song heard in seaport towns, directed to a forgotten harlot who tries to revitalize her image and former occupation. The harlot is encouraged to take up her harp and sing \"about the city\" to gain attention. Isaiah uses this song to refer to Tyre and her profitable trade, which could be compared to prostitution because Tyre sought to satisfy the carnal desires of men by selling them all manner of wares.<\/p> ",
