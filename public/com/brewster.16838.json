The child's name, which incidentally is the longest word in the Bible, means \"to speed to the spoil, he hasteneth the prey\" (\"quick to the plunder, swift to the spoil\"). The name was symbolic of the pending fall of Damascus (capital of Syria) and Samaria (capital of the northern kingdom) to the invading Assyrian armies.<\/p>     <table>         <tbody>             <tr>                 <td><b><a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODE2XQ==\">Isaiah 8<\/a><br><br><br>1 Moreover the Lord said unto me<u>,<\/u> Take thee a great roll, and write in it with a man's pen concerning Maher-shalal-hash-baz.<br><br>2 And I took unto me faithful witnesses to record, Uriah the priest, and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah.<br><br>3 And I went unto the prophetess; and she conceived<u>,<\/u> and bare a son.
