Even when they are rebuilt (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 44:26; 58:12; 61:4<\/a>), the sheer numbers of Jehovah&rsquo;s returning people necessitates that they spread out from there: &ldquo;Expand the site of your tent; extend the canopies of your dwellings. Do not hold back; lengthen your cords and strengthen your stakes.
