To that end, he remains &ldquo;aloof&rdquo; or above the fray until they either prove faithful to him or yield to fear and panic. To those who pass his test and &ldquo;wait&rdquo; for him, Jehovah proves faithful by protecting them (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 8:17; 25:9; 26:3; 33:2; 64:4<\/a>). While the wicked enjoy no covenant blessings stemming from Jehovah&rsquo;s &ldquo;favor&rdquo; or &ldquo;mercy&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 13:11; 26:21; 27:11; 59:18; 65:13-15<\/a>), his &ldquo;favor&rdquo; and &ldquo;mercy&rdquo; extend to all who repent and rely on him through the evil time (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 49:8, 10; 54:6-8; 55:7, 12; 60:10; 63:7<\/a>).<\/p>",
