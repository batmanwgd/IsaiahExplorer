    "html": " <p><i>The chapter has a dual meaning for us. First, it shows that Isaiah was a prophet not to Judah alone but to all the known world, in that Isaiah warned Egypt and Ethiopia of impending doom. Likewise, the president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the prophet for the entire world. Second, the prophecy served to warn Judah not to place her trust in Egypt and Ethiopia, nor to make them her allies. Similarly, as individuals and as members of the Church, we should never place our trust in armed forces or powerful countries. Our trust should be in Jesus Christ.<\/i><\/p> ",
