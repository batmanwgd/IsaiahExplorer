    "html": " <p>This entire chapter deals directly with us as members of the Church; it shows the great love and care that the Lord has for us and outlines the many blessings that can be ours:<\/p> <p>With his great sword, the Lord punishes Satan (27:1);<\/p> <p>He provides us (the vineyard) with water every moment (27:3);<\/p> <p>He watches over us (the vineyard) night and day (27:3);<\/p> <p>He protects us from our enemies (briers and thorns) (27:4);<\/p> <p>He provides us with peace (27:5);<\/p> <p>Because of him, we will \"fill the face of the world with fruit\" (27:6); and<\/p> <p>He will thresh the nations and gather us from the world one by one (27:12).<\/p> <p>The words in this chapter imply a covenantal relationship. In return for the many blessings bestowed on us by the Lord, we will share the gospel in all the world (27:6, 12) and worship him at his holy temple (27:13).<\/p> <blockquote> In that day the Lord with his [hard] and great and strong sword     <br><i>shall punish<\/i> <u>leviathan the [fleeing] serpent<\/u>, even <u>leviathan that crooked serpent<\/u>;     <br>and he <i>shall slay<\/i> <u>the dragon<\/u> that is in the sea. (27:1)     <br>In that day sing ye [about], A vineyard of [delight]. (27:2)     <br><i>I the Lord<\/i> do <u>keep it<\/u>;     <br><i>I <\/i> will <u>water it<\/u> every moment:     <br>lest any hurt it, <i>I <\/i> will [<u>guard<\/u>] it night and day. (27:3)     <br>Fury is not in me:     <br>who would set the briers and thorns against me in battle?     <br><i>I would go through<\/i> <u>them<\/u>,     <br><i>I would burn<\/i> <u>them<\/u> together. (27:4)     <br>Or let him take hold of my strength,     <br>that <i>he<\/i> <i>may make<\/i> <u>peace with me<\/u>;     <br>and <i>he<\/i> <i>shall make<\/i> <u>peace with me<\/u>. (27:5)     <br>[In days to come <i> Jacob <\/i> will] <u>take root:<\/u>     <br><i>Israel <\/i><u>shall blossom and bud<\/u>,     <br>and <u>fill the face of the world with fruit<\/u>. (27:6)     <br><i>Hath he smitten him,<\/i> <u>as he smote those<\/u> that smote him?     <br>or <i>is he slain<\/i> <u>according to the slaughter of them<\/u> that are slain by him? (27:7)     <br>[By warfare and exile you contend with him],     <br>he stayeth his rough wind in the day of the east wind. (27:8)     <br>By this therefore shall the <i>iniquity<\/i> <i>of Jacob <\/i> <u>be purged<\/u>;     <br>and this is all the fruit to <u>take away<\/u> <i>his sin;<\/i>     <br>when he maketh all the <i>stones of the altar<\/i> as <u>chalkstones<\/u> that are <u>beaten in sunder<\/u>,     <br>the <i>groves and images<\/i> shall <u>not stand up<\/u>. (27:9)     <br>Yet the <i>defenced city<\/i> shall be <u>desolate<\/u>,     <br>and the<i> habitation<\/i> <u>forsaken<\/u>,     <br>and <u>left<\/u> like a <i>wilderness:<\/i>     <br><i>there shall<\/i> <u>the calf<\/u> <u>feed<\/u>,     <br>and <i>there shall<\/i> <u>he lie down<\/u>,     <br>and consume the branches thereof. (27:10)     <br>When the <i>boughs <\/i>thereof <u>are withered<\/u>,     <br><i>they<\/i> <u>shall be broken off:<\/u>     <br>the women come, and <u>set<\/u> <i>them<\/i> <u>on fire:<\/u>     <br>for it is a people of no understanding:     <br>therefore <i>he that made<\/i> <i>them<u> <\/u><\/i><u>will not have mercy on them<\/u>,     <br>and <i>he that formed<\/i> <i>them <\/i><u>will [show] them no favor<\/u>. (27:11)     <br>And it shall come to pass in that day,     <br>that the Lord shall beat off from the <i>channel of the river <\/i>     <br><i>unto the stream of Egypt,<\/i>     <br>and ye shall be gathered one by one, O ye children of Israel. (27:12)     <br>And it shall come to pass in that day, that the great trumpet shall be blown,     <br>and they shall come which were <i>ready to perish<\/i> in the <u>land of Assyria<\/u>,     <br>and <i>the outcasts <\/i>in the <u>land of Egypt<\/u>,     <br>and shall worship the Lord in the holy mount at Jerusalem.
