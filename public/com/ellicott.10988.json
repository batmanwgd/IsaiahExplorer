The idea seems to be that of a scion or shoot which is mildewed and blasted, and which men fling away as loathsome.<\/p>\n <p>As the raiment of those that are slain . . .\u2014The image reminds us of the \u201cgarments rolled in blood \u201cof <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 9:5<\/a>, gathered after the battle, and \u201ccast forth\u201d to be burnt. In such raiment, not in stately robes nor kingly grave-clothes, would the great ruler be found. To lie thus unburied, \u201ca prey to dogs and vultures\u201d (Homer, Iliad, i. 4), was, as with the Homeric heroes, the shame of all shames.<\/p>\n <p>That go down to the stones of the pit.\u2014By some critics these words are joined with the following verse: Those that go down . . . with them thou shalt not be joined in burial, i.e., shalt have no proper sepulchre. As the passage stands, \u201cthe stones of the pit\u201d represent the burial-place into which the carcases of the slain were indiscriminately thrown.<\/p>",
