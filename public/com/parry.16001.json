All animals will be vegetarians, as will man, partly because death of man and animals (in which body and spirit are separated) will cease.<\/p> <p><i>dust shall be the serpent's meat.<\/i> Interestingly, this was the curse placed on the serpent in the Garden of Eden (<a class=\"ref\">Gen. 3:14<\/a>).
