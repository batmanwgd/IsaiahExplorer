Assyria&rsquo;s ancient invasion of the Promised Land serves as the type of an end-time invasion of promised lands. The archtyrant&rsquo;s coveted prize is &ldquo;the mountain of the Daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem&rdquo;&mdash;the righteous nation or nations of Jehovah&rsquo;s people. The world&rsquo;s inhabitants flee before his rapid military advance as his forces sweep into countries like a river in flood (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc4MTUiOjR9LFsxODM3MV0seyIxODM3NyI6NH1d\">Isaiah 8:7-10; 37:18, 24-27<\/a>).
