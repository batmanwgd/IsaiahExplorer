In light of verse 1, however, we can see an entirely different meaning. Verse 5 describes the gathering of the nations to the Americas, as prophesied in verse 1. \"The isles saw it, and feared,\" meaning they responded to Jehovah's call and, in the fear (love) of the Lord, \"drew near, and came,\" and built up a mighty Gentile nation in the land of America (see <a class=\"ref\">1 Ne. 22:7<\/a>). Verses 6 and 7 describe the cooperation required of the people from many lands who firmly established a nation \"that it should not be moved.\" Actually, this could be a dual prophecy of the establishment of the nation and of the Church upon that land.<\/p>     ",
