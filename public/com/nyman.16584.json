Abinadi equated this verse with Jesus' submission even to an ultimate crucifixion according to the will of the Father (see <a class=\"ref\">Mosiah 15:6-7<\/a>). That he was oppressed and afflicted is shown in the accounts of his trials (see <a class=\"ref\">Matt. 26:67-68; 27:29; Mark 14:65; 15:19; Luke 22:63-65<\/a>). His not opening his mouth was completely fulfilled when he stood silent before Herod (see <a class=\"ref\">Luke 23:8-11<\/a>). However, he did answer some questions put to him by Pilate (see <a class=\"ref\">Matt. 27:11-14<\/a>) and the high priest (see <a class=\"ref\">Mark 14:56-62<\/a>). Peter paraphrased this verse in telling of Christ's suffering (see <a class=\"ref\">1 Pet. 2:23<\/a>). The eunuch Philip found was reading <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODcxOSI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 53:7-8<\/a>, and when Philip testified of Jesus, he was baptized (<a class=\"ref\">Acts 8:26-38<\/a>).<\/p>     ",
