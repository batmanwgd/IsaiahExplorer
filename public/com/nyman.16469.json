    "html": "               <p>Chapters 30 through 35 present the last three of the six \"woes\" beginning in Isaiah chapter 28. These three warnings appear to be based on actual historical incidents. They sound very similar to each other, especially the first two, as they refer to seeking help from Egypt, but careful analysis reveals a distinction between them. The first warning speaks against trusting the wisdom of man, and the second against trusting the power of man, as shown in the following outline.<\/p>     <p>1. Woe to those who trust in their own wisdom instead of the Lord's counsel (30:1-17).<\/p>     <p>a. Their trust will turn to shame and confusion (30:1-7).<\/p>     <p>b. A testimony of their rebellion against the seers and prophets will be recorded (30:8-11).<\/p>     <p>c. Because of this false trust, they will be purged until only a remnant is left as an ensign on a hill (30:12-17).<\/p>     <p>2. The Lord will wait to be exalted in Jerusalem (30: 18-33).<\/p>     <p>a. He will then answer Israel's prayers (30:19).<\/p>     <p>b. After adversity, they will see their Messiah (30:20).<\/p>     <p>c. The Holy Ghost will be given as their guide (30:21).<\/p>     <p>d. Idols will be cast away (30:22).<\/p>     <p>e. The land will be productive, and animals will prosper (30:23-25).<\/p>     <p>f. The night will be as bright as the sun, and the day seven times as bright (30:26). <\/p>     <p>g. The anger of the Lord will remove the corruptible elements from the earth (30:27-33).<\/p>     <p>3. Woe to those who trust in the arm of flesh (31:1-9).<\/p>     <p>a. The Lord will destroy evil in his own time and wisdom (31:2).<\/p>     <p>b. The Egyptians and their horses are flesh, not spirit (31:3).<\/p>     <p>c. The Lord will defend Jerusalem (31:4-5).<\/p>     <p>d. In the future, people will turn to the Lord and cast away their idols (31:6-7).<\/p>     <p>e. The Gentiles will fall from the sword of the Lord and will be afraid of the ensign which is in Zion and in Jerusalem (31:8-9).<\/p>     <p>4. The Lord will reign in righteousness, and his princes will judge righteously (32:1-20).<\/p>     <p>a. The righteous man will receive great knowledge (32:2-4).<\/p>     <p>b. The wicked man will not prosper (32:5-8).<\/p>     <p>c. The women who are at ease are warned of a coming long period of tribulation (32:9-15).<\/p>     <p>1) The land will become thorns and briers.<\/p>     <p>2) The houses will be left desolate, and animals will inhabit them.<\/p>     <p>3) They will remain desolate until the Spirit is poured out from on high.<\/p>     <p>d. The work of righteousness will go forth in peace (32:16-17).<\/p>     <p>e. The Lord's people will dwell in peaceful habitations, sure dwellings, and quiet resting places (32:18-20).<\/p>     <p>5. A warning is given to those who take other men's goods rather than labor with their own hands (33:1-12).<\/p>     <p>a. As they sowed, so will they reap (33:1).<\/p>     <p>b. The Lord will dwell in Zion (33:2-10).<\/p>     <p>c. The spoilers will be burned by fire (33:11-12).<\/p>     <p>6. Zion will be purged, and the righteous will dwell in everlasting fire (33:13-24).<\/p>     <p>a. The sinners in Zion will be afraid (33:14). <\/p>     <p>b. The righteous will dwell on high with great blessings and understanding (33:15-19).<\/p>     <p>c. Zion and Jerusalem will be permanently established (33:20).<\/p>     <p>d.

The land will be desolate, and birds and beasts will inhabit it (34:11-15).<\/p>     <p>8.         <ft>The names of the righteous will be written in the book of the Lord (34:16-35:10),<\/ft>     <\/p>     <p>a. None of these will fail (34:16).<\/p>     <p>b. They will inherit the land forever (34:17).<\/p>     <p>c. The desert will blossom as a rose (35:1-2).<\/p>     <p>d.

The ransomed of the Lord will return on a highway called the \"way of holiness\" (35:8-10).<\/p>     <p>Although none of these chapters are quoted in the Book of Mormon, several passages from chapter 35 are cited in the Doctrine and Covenants, and a few verses appear in the New Testament. These passages <i>give<\/i> insight into an understanding of Isaiah's message. There are also several very enlightening comments by the Brethren, <i>especially<\/i> on some of the verses in chapters 32 and 35.<\/p>     ",
