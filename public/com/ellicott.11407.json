At the time of his illness the king may still have been childless, and the thought that there was no son to take his place may have added bitterness to his grief. \u201cThy truth,\u201d has here the sense of \u201cfaithfulness\u201d rather than of the truth about God which is the object of belief. <\/p> ",
