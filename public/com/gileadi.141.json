Because of their wickedness, Jehovah &ldquo;cuts off&rdquo; both from his presence in &ldquo;a single day&rdquo;&mdash;his Day of Judgment (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODYzMyI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 48:18-19<\/a>). Because a people&rsquo;s leaders reflect what the people are, the leaders&rsquo; misleading and confusing &ldquo;these people&rdquo;&mdash;Jehovah&rsquo;s alienated people&mdash;constitutes an integral part of their punishment (cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzIwXQ==\">Isaiah 3:12<\/a>). Most reprehensible in the prophets who represent Jehovah to his people are the &ldquo;falsehoods&rdquo; or &ldquo;lies&rdquo; (<em>seqer<\/em>) they teach (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODE3MiwxODIwNF0seyIxODI2NiI6Mn1d\">Isaiah 28:7; 29:10; 32:6-7<\/a>). <\/p> ",
