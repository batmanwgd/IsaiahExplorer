The verse paints in vivid symbolic language the judgment of Jehovah on the great world-powers that had shed the blood of His people. The \u201csword of the Lord\u201d (primarily, perhaps, representing the lightning-flash) is turned in its threefold character as sore, and swift, and strong, against three great empires.

By some commentators, however, Egypt is represented in all three clauses; while others (Cheyne) see in them the symbols not of earthly empire, but of rebel powers of evil and darkness, quoting <a class=\"ref\">Job 26:12-13 <\/a>,in support of his view. <\/p>,",
