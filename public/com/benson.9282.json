Here follows, therefore, a series of excellent blessings, to be conferred by God after these judgments. And the prophet hath so ordered his style in setting them forth, that when he seems to promise only temporal blessings to the church, he would be understood mystically under these figurative emblems.\u201d \u2014 Vitringa. <i>The people shall dwell in Zion, <\/i>&c. \u2014 This is the first of these blessings, the restoration of their state upon their repentance and earnest prayers: as if he had said, Although the time is coming when the people shall be banished from Jerusalem and carried into captivity; yet after a set time they shall return and have a fixed and comfortable abode in Jerusalem, the seat of their religion, and metropolis of their republic. This was in part fulfilled upon their return from Babylon, \u201cwhen the tears which they had shed in their banishment were wiped away, and God heard the prayers and vows of his people, after the time of his indignation was expired.\u201d But it was more fully accomplished in the times of the gospel, when many of them were, and the whole body of them shall be, brought into Christ\u2019s church, often called Zion and Jerusalem.<\/p>",
