A palpable mistake, like that in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NTAwXQ==\">Isaiah 42:19<\/a>. The correction is self-evident from the very terms of the sentence; from the necessity of the strict correspondence in the expressions between the question and the answer made to it, - and it is apparent to the blindest and most prejudiced eye. However, if authority is also necessary, there is that of the Syriac and Vulgate for it; who plainly read <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05e2\u05e8\u05d9\u05e5 <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, arits<\/span>, in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NjYxXQ==\">Isaiah 49:24<\/a>; as well as in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NjYyXQ==\">Isaiah 49:25<\/a>, rendering it in the former place by the same word as in the latter. - L. <\/p>\n\n <p>These two last verses contain a glorious promise of deliverance to the persecuted Church of Christ from the terrible one - Satan, and all his representatives and vicegerents, persecuting antichristian rulers. They shall at last cease from destroying the Church of God, and destroy one another. <\/p>",
