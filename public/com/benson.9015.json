The meaning is, I will remove my ministers, who have used great care and diligence to make you fruitful: <i>but there shall come up briers and thorns <\/i>\u2014 I will give you up to your own wicked lusts. <i>I will also command the clouds <\/i>\u2014 I will deprive you of all my blessings.<\/p>",
