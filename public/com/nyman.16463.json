The Book of Mormon retains the word \"and\" in introducing the verse, which indicates that it refers back to what has been said. The warning is to those who refuse the message of the \"marvellous work and a wonder\" -the Book of Mormon-which would come forth to correct the precepts of men and who even try to work against it in secret. The Book of Mormon also retains the declaration that the Lord will show them that he is aware of their doings (see <a class=\"ref\">2 Ne. 27:27<\/a>). Probably this is partly a reference to those who would take the 116 pages of manuscript with the intent to change them and frustrate the works of God. In his foreknowledge, God had prepared the way to frustrate their work (see D&amp;C sections 3 and 10). Paul quoted part of verse 16 in demonstrating how the Lord brings out his purposes (see <a class=\"ref\">Rom. 9:20<\/a>).<\/p>     ",
