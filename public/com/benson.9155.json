The reader will observe, God is said in Scripture <i>to rest, <\/i> or <i>sit still, <\/i> when he does not work on the behalf of a person or people; as, on the contrary, he is said to <i>bestir <\/i> himself when he acts for them. <i>And I will consider in my dwelling-place <\/i>\u2014Namely, in the heavens, what time will be most proper for the execution of my purpose upon these proud blasphemers of my name, and persecutors of my people. This is spoken after the manner of men. <i>Like a clear heat upon herbs, <\/i> &c.\u2014The meaning of these metaphorical expressions is, that God would not so rest as to lay aside all care and regard for his people; but that he rested with the best and most benevolent purpose of comforting them after this affliction, and of giving them refreshment, like that of a serene heat after a heavy rain, or a cloud of dew in the time of harvest. <\/p> ",
