    "html": " <p>Two possibilities exist for interpreting this verse. First&mdash;as Hebrew has no question marks&mdash;Jehovah is asking, &ldquo;With blood on your hands, do you still imagine you can become clean? Do you assume I will readily pardon you though you are guilty of the unpardonable sin?&rdquo; Do Jehovah&rsquo;s people pretend that the God who said, &ldquo;Whoever sheds a man&rsquo;s blood, by man shall his blood be shed&rdquo; (<a class=\"ref\">Genesis 9:6 <\/a>), will simply overlook their crimes so long as they go to church and put on a good appearance? That kind of hypocrisy is indeed characteristic of a Sodom-and-Gomorrah type of society (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzY2NCI6Mn0=\">vv 9-10 <\/a>). <\/p> <p>Second, in this verse&rsquo;s larger context of Jehovah&rsquo;s people&rsquo;s repenting of transgression and purifying their lives, they may even now become clean of gross crimes. They shouldn&rsquo;t assume, though burdened with guilt, that they are too far gone, that there exists no further hope of recovery. The &ldquo;test&rdquo; Jehovah presents is whether or not they will repent of doing evil. While &ldquo;scarlet&rdquo; and &ldquo;crimson&rdquo;&mdash;the color of &ldquo;blood&rdquo;&mdash;allude to murder, abortion, etc. (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NjcwXQ==\">v 15 <\/a>), they also signify the stain of wickedness in general. Jehovah is willing to forgive those who &ldquo;cease to do evil&rdquo; and &ldquo;learn to do good&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzY3MSI6Mn0=\">vv 16-17 <\/a>). <\/p> ",
