    "html": "<p>I will ascend into heaven.\u2014The boast of the Chald\u00e6an king is represented as nothing less than an apotheosis, which they themselves claimed. So Shalmaneser describes himself as \u201ca sun-god\u201d (Records of the Past, iii. 83), Assurbanipal as \u201clord of all kings\u201d (ib., iii. 78). In contrast with the Sheol into which the Chald\u00e6an king had sunk, the prophet paints the heaven to which he sought to rise. He, the brightest star, would raise his throne above all the stars of God. <\/p>\n <p>I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation . . .\u2014The words have often been interpreted of Jerusalem or the Temple, as the \u201cmountain of assembly\u201d (as the tabernacle was \u201cthe tent of the congregation,\u201d or \u201cof meeting\u201d), and \u201cthe sides (better, recesses) of the north\u201d have been connected, like the same phrase in <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 48:2<\/a>, with the portion of the Temple which the king of Babylon is supposed to threaten. Most modern scholars are, however, agreed that this interpretation is untenable. What is brought before us is the heaven, the \u201cmountain of assembly,\u201d where the great gods in whom the king of Babylon believed sat in council. So Assyrian hymns speak of \u201cthe feasts of the silver mountains, the heavenly courts\u201d (as the Greeks spoke of Olympus), where the gods dwell eternally (Records of the Past, iii. 133). And this ideal mountain was for them, like the Meru of Indian legend, in the farthest north. So in the legendary geography of Greece, the Hyperborei, or \u201cpeople beyond the north wind,\u201d were a holy and blessed race, the chosen servants of Apollo (Herod., ii. 32-36). In <a class=\"ref\">Ezekiel 28:14<\/a>, the prophet recognises an ideal \u201cmountain of God\u201d of like nature, and the vision of the future glory of a transfigured Zion, in chap 2:1-3, implies, as we have seen, an idea of the same kind. Possibly the same thought appears in Ezekiel\u2019s vision, \u201cout of the north\u201d (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NjU5XQ==\">Isaiah 1:4<\/a>). <\/p>",
