He vowed to send a flood to cleanse the earth in Noah&rsquo;s day and then covenanted with Noah that He would never again destroy the earth in that manner (see<a class=\"ref\">Genesis 9:13&ndash;17<\/a>). His promise to restore Israel in the latter days is &ldquo;as the waters of Noah unto me&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzMzXQ==\">Isaiah 54:9<\/a>), that is, His promise to restore Israel is just as sure as His promise to Noah. Mountains may depart and &ldquo;hills be removed&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzM0XQ==\">v. 10<\/a>), but God&rsquo;s promise will still see fulfillment.<\/p><p>In her gathered condition Zion shall be beautiful. The precious gems mentioned in<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc2NTYiOjMxfSxbMTg3MzZdXQ==\">verses 11 and 12<\/a> represent the material and spiritual blessings that redeemed Israel will enjoy (see also<a class=\"ref\">Revelation 21:19&ndash;21<\/a>), including children being &ldquo;taught of the Lord&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzM3XQ==\">Isaiah 54:13<\/a>) and knowing great peace. Those who gather together to oppress latter-day Israel &ldquo;shall fall for thy sake&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzM5XQ==\">v. 15<\/a>), for &ldquo;no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzQxXQ==\">v. 17<\/a> ; see also<a class=\"ref\">Doctrine and Covenants 71:9&ndash;10<\/a> , where a similar promise is made to Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon).<\/p><p class=\"cite\"> LDS Church Educational System Old Testament Student Manual, 1 Kings&ndash;Malachi, Religion 302, Chapter 17, Item 29<\/p> ",
