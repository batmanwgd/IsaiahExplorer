    "html": "<p>When the Assyrian alliance of nations destroys Greater Babylon, agriculture undergoes a dearth as typified by withering &ldquo;vines&rdquo; and &ldquo;vineyards&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 24:7; 42:15<\/a>). Jehovah&rsquo;s people who return to Zion in a new wandering in the wilderness, on the other hand, experience the opposite: &ldquo;Then shall a Spirit from on high be poured out on us; the desert shall become productive land and lands now productive be reckoned as brushwood&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 32:15<\/a>). The idea of vines that &ldquo;spread abroad across the sea&rdquo; alludes to the interdependence of all parts of Greater Babylon&rsquo;s economic empire (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgwODUiOjJ9LFsxODA4OSwxODYwNSwxODYwNV1d\">Isaiah 23:7-8, Isaiah 23:7-8, 11; 47:5; 47:5<\/a>).<\/p>",
