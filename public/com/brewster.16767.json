    "html": "<p><b>(<a class=\"ref\">2 Nephi 15:17<\/a>).<\/b>\"<i>The waste places of the fat ones shall strangers eat.<\/i>\" Some commentaries suggest this verse should be placed next to verse 10. It is probably a reference to the desolate condition of the lands once inhabited by the wealthy. Rather than producing bountiful crops, their lands will provide forage for lambs and young goats or strangers. (The word \"strangers\" appears as \"aliens\" in early Hebrew texts while the Greek Septuagint uses \"young goats.\")<\/p>",
