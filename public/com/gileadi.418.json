    "html": "<p>As Hezekiah&rsquo;s emissaries, the servants repeat verbatim his report to a higher authority. The &ldquo;woeful day&rdquo;&mdash;of suffering Jehovah&rsquo;s collective curse on the nation for its cumulative transgressions (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzgwMCI6OX0=\">Isaiah 7:17-25<\/a>)&mdash;is a type of Jehovah&rsquo;s end-time Day of Judgment. Like that future event, however, it presents an opportunity for spiritual rebirth and regeneration, not only for &ldquo;the remnant that is left&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzg3MSI6NH0=\">Isaiah 10:20-23<\/a>) but also for the king. Called &ldquo;the Birthpangs of the Messiah,&rdquo; Jehovah&rsquo;s people collectively go into travail like a woman in labor until Jehovah sends them a deliverer such as Moses or David.<\/p><p>By asking Isaiah to intercede with Jehovah on behalf of the people, Hezekiah in no way shifts the burden of his responsibility for his people&rsquo;s protection to Isaiah. The king himself intercedes with Jehovah on their behalf, even in the midst of grievous personal anguish (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc4NjUiOjd9LHsiMTgzOTIiOjIwfV0=\">vv 14-20; Isaiah 38:1-20<\/a>). Hezekiah simply recognizes that Isaiah is able to appeal to Jehovah on a higher spiritual level than his own and thus exercise greater power with God. He also acknowledges that under his people&rsquo;s present unequal circumstances &ldquo;there is no strength to deliver&rdquo; them from Assyria&rsquo;s siege without Jehovah&rsquo;s help.<\/p>",
