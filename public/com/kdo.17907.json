    "html": "<p> It would be with them as it was with the Philistines when David turned their army into water at Baal-perazim (<a class=\"ref\">2 Samuel 5:20; 1 Chronicles 14:11<\/a>), or when on another occasion he drove them before him from Gibeon to Gezer (<a class=\"ref\">1 Chronicles 14:13<\/a>.). <em> \u201cFor Jehovah will rise up as in the mountain of Perazim, and be wroth as in the valley at Gibeon to work His work; astonishing is His work; and to act His act: strange is His act.\u201d<\/em> The Targum wrongly supposes the first historical reminiscence to refer to the earthquake in the time of Uzziah, and the second to Joshua's victory over the Amorites. The allusion really is to the two shameful defeats which David inflicted upon the Philistines. There was a very good reason why victories over the Philistines especially should serve as similes. The same fate awaited the Philistines at the hands of the Assyrians, as predicted by the prophet in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3OTU3XQ==\">Isaiah 14:28<\/a>. (cf., <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODAzMSI6Nn0=\">Isaiah 20:1-6<\/a>). And the strangeness and verity of Jehovah's work were just this, that it would fare no better with the magnates of Judah at the hand of Asshur, than it had with the Philistines at the hand of David on both those occasions. The very same thing would now happen to the people of the house of David as formerly to its foes. Jehovah would have to act in opposition to His gracious purpose. He would have to act towards His own people as He once acted towards their foes. This was the most paradoxical thing of all that they would have to experience.<\/p>",
