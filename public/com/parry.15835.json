Joseph Smith taught: \"When his commandments teach us, it is in view of eternity; for we are looked upon by God as though we were in eternity. God dwells in eternity, and does not view things as we do.\" <\/p> <p><i>high and holy place.<\/i> In the ancient temples of Israel, the two most sacred, innermost rooms were called the <i>holy place,<\/i> which only the priests could enter, and \"the most holy place,\" or \"the holy of holies,\" which only the high priest could enter and even then only on the most holy day of the year (Day of Atonement). A <i>holy place<\/i> would be in the temple; a <i>high and holy place<\/i> would be the temple in heaven, the celestial kingdom.<\/p> <p><i>contrite and humble spirit.<\/i> Those who are sorrowful for their sins, repentant, and fully reliant on God have a <i>contrite and humble spirit.<\/i> These are they who will dwell in the house of the Lord forever; these are they who are invited to live with him in his \"high and holy place\" in the celestial world.<\/p> <p><i>revive the spirit\/revive the heart.<\/i> Those who are humble and contrite will be given new life and energy in Christ, despite their own weakness (61:1-3; <a class=\"ref\">Ps. 51:10<\/a>). <\/p> ",
