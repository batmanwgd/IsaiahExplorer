It also contains a significant synonymous parallel between the Lord and the Servant. To \u201cfear the L<small>ORD<\/small>\u201d is synonymous with obeying \u201cthe word of his servant,\u201d and vice versa (50:10). Once again, this \u201cservant\u201d cannot be the nation but someone else, One who brings God\u2019s word to the nation. Nor is it the prophet, for to obey the prophet\u2019s word is not synonymous with fearing the Lord. More and more clearly, this Servant is in a unique position.<\/p>     <p>\u2003Clearly, one\u2019s response to the Servant is in the nature of a watershed. Those who have \u201cno light\u201d can walk safely if they will entrust themselves to God in the way that he has revealed. But those who reject God\u2019s revealed way and try to manufacture their own light will find that the way they have chosen leads to \u201ctorment\u201d (50:11). Furthermore, to listen to the Servant is to \u201ctrust\u201d God, while refusing to listen to what he says is tantamount to refusing to trust God.<\/p>     ",
