    "html": "<p><i>The earth hath mourned and languished. <\/i> Here he describes more fully how wretched and desperate the Jews would perceive their condition to be, that their confidence might nevertheless come forth out of a deep gulf. The places are also specified by him, <i>Lebanon, Bashan,<\/i> and<i>Carmel,<\/i> which are widely distant from each other, and which form almost the farthest boundaries of the holy land, in order to shew that no part of it; will remain safe or uninjured. He describes this calamity in such a manner as to assign to each place what peculiarly belongs to it. To \u201cLebanon\u201d he assigns confusion, because it is elsewhere mentioned as beautiful and glorious, in consequence of having been covered with lofty and valuable trees. He declares that \u201cSharon,\u201d which was a level and fertile district, will be \u201clike a wilderness,\u201d and that \u201cBashan and Carmel,\u201d which abounded in \u201cfruits,\u201d will be \u201cshaken.\u201d Thus he alludes to the natural character of each place, and describes the misery and distress in such a manner as to magnify and illustrate the kindness of God, by whom they would be delivered, even though they appeared to be utterly ruined; for here we may see the hand of God openly displayed, if it be not thought preferable to view the Prophet as relating a past transaction in order to excite them to thankfulness.<\/p> ",
