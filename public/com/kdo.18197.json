The subject of the verb (<em> ' a\u0302mar <\/em> ) is not Jehovah; but the prophet intentionally leaves it obscure, as in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDI0LDE4NDI3XQ==\">Isaiah 40:3, Isaiah 40:6<\/a> (cf., <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTMzXQ==\">Isaiah 26:2<\/a>). It is a heavenly cry; and the crier is not to be more precisely named.<\/p>",
