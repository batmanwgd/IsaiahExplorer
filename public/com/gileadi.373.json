In a reversal of circumstances between fertile lands and wilderness, the &ldquo;desert&rdquo; or wilderness blossoms while fertile lands revert to wilderness. Reflective of the righteous who go into the wilderness at the onset of Jehovah&rsquo;s Day of Judgment, and of the wicked who remain behind amidst ruination, the earth&rsquo;s entire landscape changes to accommodate Jehovah&rsquo;s blessing of the righteous and curse upon the wicked (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc4MDQiOjR9LFsxNzk0Nl0seyIxODMyMiI6N30seyIxODUyNSI6M31d\">Isaiah 7:21-24; 14:17; 35:1-7; 43:19-21<\/a>). <\/p> ",
