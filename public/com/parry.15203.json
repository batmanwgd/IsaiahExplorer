Through a rhetorical question Isaiah explains that a plowman does not plow continually (literally all day and every day). If so, the growing season would be over before the seeds were ever planted. The farmer must move on to other duties if the plants are to be fully grown at harvest time. Similarly, the Lord follows a precise pattern as he deals with his people.<\/p> ",
