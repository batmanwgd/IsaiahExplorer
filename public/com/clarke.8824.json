Now if we compare  <a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 2:25<\/a>; and  <a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 18:12<\/a>, we shall find that the subject is in both places quite the same with this of Isaiah; and the sentiment expressed, that of a desperate resolution to continue at all hazards in their idolatrous practices; the very thing that in all reason we might expect here.
