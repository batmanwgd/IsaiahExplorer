    "html": "<p> He was angry, but not without love; He punished, but only to be able to pardon again. <em> \u201cTherefore will the guilt of Jacob be purged thus: and this is all the fruit of the removal of his son: when He maketh all altar-stones like chalk-stones that are broken in pieces, Astarte images and sun-pillars do not rise up again.\u201d<\/em> With the word \u201ctherefore\u201d (<em> la\u0302ce\u0304n <\/em> ) a conclusion is drawn from the expression \u201cby measure.\u201d God punished Israel \u201cby measure;\u201d His punishment is a way to salvation: therefore it ceases as soon as its purpose is secured; and so would it cease now, if Israel would thoroughly renounce its sin, and, above all, the sin of all sins, namely idolatry. \u201cThus\u201d (by this) refers to the \u05d1\u05bc\u05e9\u05c2\u05d5\u05de\u05d5 which follows; \u201cby this,\u201d namely the breaking to pieces of the altars and images of the moon goddess; or possibly, to speak more correctly, the goddess of the morning-star, and those of the sun-god as well (see <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3OTkyXQ==\">Isaiah 17:8<\/a>). By the fact that Israel put away the fundamental cause of all mischief, viz., idolatry, the guilt for which it had yet to make atonement would be covered, made good, or wiped away (on <em> cuppar <\/em> , see at <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MDY3XQ==\">Isaiah 22:14<\/a>). The parenthesis (cf.,  ) affirms that this very consequence would be all the fruit (<em> co\u0306l<\/em> -<em> peri <\/em> ) desired by Jehovah of the removal of the sin of Israel, which the chastisement was intended to effect.<\/p>",
