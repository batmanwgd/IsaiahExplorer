This promise seems to have been made with a design to raise the minds and hearts of the Jews from carnal and worldly things, to which they were too much addicted, to spiritual and heavenly blessings, and thereby to prepare them for the reception of the gospel. <i>And they shall spring up, <\/i>&c. \u2014 They shall increase and flourish like grass, and those herbs and plants which grow up in the midst of it. <i>One shall say, I am the Lord\u2019s, <\/i>&c. \u2014 This verse seems to relate to the increase of the church by the accession of the Gentiles: as if he had said, The blessing of God upon the Jews shall be so remarkable that many of the Gentiles shall join themselves unto them, and accept Jehovah for their God, and own themselves for his people.<\/p>",
