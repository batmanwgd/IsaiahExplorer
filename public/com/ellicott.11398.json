As a fact, however, the complaint did not, and could not, come in the \u201cquiet\u201d of his life, but after it had passed away; (2) \u201cin the dividing point,\u201d scil., the \u201chalf-way house of life.\u201d Hezekiah was thirty-nine, but the word might rightly be used of the years between thirty-five and forty, which were the moieties of the seventy and eighty years of the psalmist (<a class=\"ref\">Psalms 90:10<\/a>). We are reminded of Dante\u2019s \u201cNel mezza del cammin di nostra vita\u201d (Inf. i. 1).<\/p> \n<p>The gates of the grave.\u2014The image is what we should call Dantesque. Sheol, the Hades of the Hebrews, is, as in the Assyrian representations of the unseen world, and as in the Inferno of Dante (iii. 11, vii. 2, x. 22), a great city, and, therefore, it has its gates, which again become, as with other cities, the symbol of its power. So we have \u201cgates of death\u201d in<a class=\"ref\">Job 38:17; Psalms 9:18; Psalms 107:18<\/a> .<\/p> \n<p>The residue . . .\u2014The words assume a normal duration, say of seventy years, on which the sufferer, who had, as he thought, done nothing to deserve punishment, might have legitimately counted.<\/p> ",
