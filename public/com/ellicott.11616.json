A man thus \u201cengraved\u201d the name of his god, or the outlines of his home, or the face of her he loved, upon his hands or arms. So, by a boldly anthropomorphic figure, Jehovah had \u201cgraven\u201d Jerusalem on His hands. He could not open them, i.e., could not act, without being reminded of her. The \u201cwalls\u201d may be either those of the earthly city lying in ruins, or those of the heavenly Jerusalem. <\/p> ",
