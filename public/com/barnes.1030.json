    "html": " <p> <em>Yea, the fir trees rejoice at thee <\/em>&mdash;They join with the inhabitants of the nations in rejoicing at thy downfall&mdash;for they now, like those inhabitants, are suffered to remain undisturbed. (On the word rendered &ldquo;fir trees,&rdquo; see the notes at <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3Njg0XQ==\">Isaiah 1:29 <\/a>.) It is evident that a species of evergreen is meant; and probably some species that grew in Syria or Palestine. The idea is plain. The very forest is represented as rejoicing. It would be safe from the king of Babylon. He could no longer cut it down to build his palaces, or to construct his implements of war. This figure of representing the hills and groves, the trees, the mountains, and the earth, as exulting, or as breaking forth into joy, is common in the Scriptures: <\/p> <p>Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; <\/p> <p>Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof. <\/p> <p>Let the field be joyful, and all that is therein: <\/p> <p>Then shall all the trees of the wood rejoice <\/p> <p>Before the Lord. <\/p> ",
