It also points to baptism (see also the corrected reading herein of 48:1), which is a ritual cleansing from sins and transgressions. Ultimately, washing with water represents symbolic washing with the blood of Christ to become spiritually clean.<\/p> <p><i>eyes.<\/i> Eyes \"are a representation of light and knowledge\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 77:4; 88:67<\/a>). \"God, of course, has all knowledge and is full of light. Thus it is said of him that his eye is an 'all-searching eye' (<a class=\"ref\">2 Ne. 9:44<\/a>) and a 'piercing eye' (<a class=\"ref\">Jacob 2:10<\/a>), meaning there is no place that his eye cannot penetrate and nothing that he does not know. He is omniscient.\" Thus in 1:16, God is aware of the Israelites' evil doings, and he commands them to cease.<\/p> ",
