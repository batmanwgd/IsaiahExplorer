    "html": "<p><b>(<a class=\"ref\">2 Nephi 27:26<\/a>).<\/b>\"<i>A marvelous work and a wonder.<\/i>\" This phrase is well known as the title of the best-selling book on the restored gospel of Jesus Christ by the late apostle, Elder LeGrand Richards. Variations of the phrase are also found in the Doctrine and Covenants. (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 4:1; 6:1; 11:1; 12:1; 14:1; 18:44<\/a>.) Its meaning was described by President Joseph Fielding Smith: \"More than seven hundred years before the birth of Jesus Christ the Lord spoke through Isaiah of the coming forth of the Book of Mormon and the restoration of the Gospel. Isaiah, by prophecy, spoke of the restoration of the new and everlasting covenant, and the Lord performing a 'marvelous work and a wonder,' which should cause 'the wisdom of their wise men' to perish, and 'the understanding of their prudent men' to be hid. \u2026 This marvelous work is the restoration of the Church and the Gospel with all the power and authority, keys and blessings which pertain to this great work for the salvation of the children of men.\" (DCE, 346.)<\/p>",
