This time, however, disbursements of products are based not on greed but on merit, such as providing for servants of Jehovah who dwell in his presence: &ldquo;You shall be called the priests of Jehovah and referred to as the ministers of our God. You shall feed on the wealth of the nations and be gratified with their choicest provision&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 61:6<\/a>).
