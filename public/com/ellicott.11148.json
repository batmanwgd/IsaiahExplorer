    "html": " <p> (21) The Lord shall punish the host of the high ones that are on high . . .\u2014The prophet\u2019s utterance becomes more and more apocalyptic. He sees more than the condemnation of the kings of earth. Jehovah visits also the \u201cprincipalities and powers in heavenly places\u201d (<a class=\"ref\">Ephesians 3:10<\/a>) or \u201con high\u201d (<a class=\"ref\">Ephesians 6:12<\/a>). Perhaps identifying these spiritual evil powers with the gods whom the nations worshipped, and these again with the stars in the firmament, Isaiah foresees a time when their long-protracted rebellion shall come to an end, and all authority and power be put down under the might of Jehovah (<a class=\"ref\">1 Corinthians 15:25<\/a>). The antithetical parallelism of the two clauses is decisive against the interpretation which sees in the \u201chigh ones on high\u201d only the representatives of earthly kingdoms, though we may admit that from the prophet\u2019s stand-point each rebel nation is thought of as swayed by a rebel spirit. (Comp. <a class=\"ref\">Daniel 10:20; Sirach 17:14<\/a>; and the LXX. of <a class=\"ref\">Deuteronomy 32:8<\/a>: \u201cHe set the bounds of the nations according to the number of the angels of God.\u201d) The same thought is found in a Rabbinic proverb, \u201cGod never destroys a nation without having first of all destroyed its prince\u201d (Delitzsch, but without a reference). <\/p> ",
