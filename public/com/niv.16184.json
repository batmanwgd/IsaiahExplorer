<h4>Original Meaning<\/h4>     <p>I<small>N CHAPTERS<\/small> 28\u201333 the prophet continues the lessons in trust that have characterized the material from chapter 13 onward. Having established God\u2019s sovereignty over the nations both in particular (chs. 13\u201323) and in general (chs. 24\u201327), Isaiah now returns to particular situations in Israel and Judah that illustrate the folly of trusting the nations instead of the King who had been revealing himself through the prophet.<\/p>     <p>\u2003Because refusal to trust in God will only lead to destruction, Isaiah begins several of the sections with the funeral word \u201cwoe\u201d (28:1; 29:1, 15; 30:1; 31:1; 33:1). It is possible to consider the material in groups of two chapters each. Chapters 28\u201329 deal with a problem that is exacerbated by the foolish, drunken leaders; chapters 30\u201331 critique the proposed solution: dependence on Egypt; and chapters 32\u201333 present the true solution: reliance on the true Leader, the righteous King.<\/p>     <p>\u2003Most of these chapters are focused on Judah, as might be expected since that is Isaiah\u2019s home. However, chapter 28 begins with a woe addressed to \u201cEphraim,\u201d that is, northern Israel. It is unclear just how far this address continues. Clearly, by 28:14 the focus has shifted to Jerusalem, and the prophet does not specifically return to Israel after that. However, most of what is said after 28:14 is still relevant to the northern kingdom since it has entered its final death throes.<\/p>     <p>\u2003This material seems to relate to events somewhat later than those recorded in chapters 7\u20138. They also apparently precede the events of chapters 36\u201337. Thus, they fall roughly between 730 and 705 <small>B.C.<\/small> When it became clear that the northern kingdom was going to fall to Assyria and that Ahaz\u2019s \u201calliance\u201d with Assyria was as worthless as Isaiah had predicted, the only human hope left was Egypt. No other country in the area had the wealth or resources to mount an army of sufficient size to stand up to the Assyrians. But to Isaiah, trusting Egypt is as foolish as trusting Assyria. Although it is unlikely that Egypt will turn on Judah as Assyria had, they are still only flesh and blood (31:3) and can offer nothing like the help that the King can.<\/p>     <p>\u2003Chapter 28 has four subunits: verses 1\u20136, 7\u201313, 14\u201322, and 23\u201329. There is a question whether verses 7\u201313 relate more closely to verses 1\u20136, as I tend to read it, or to verses 14\u201322, as Motyer does. It is a question of whether the pronouncement against Ephraim is continuing in these verses or whether it has already shifted to Judah and Jerusalem.<\/p>     ",
