Or, as the Hebrew <span class=\"hebrew_text\">,\u05e0\u05d2\u05e9\u05c1 \u05d4\u05d5\u05d0 \u05e0\u05e2\u05e0\u05d4<\/span>, is rendered by Bishop Lowth and others, <i>It was exacted, and he answered,<\/i>, or, <i>was made answerable.<\/i>, God\u2019s justice required satisfaction from us for our sins, which, alas! we were incapable of making, and he answered the demand; that is, became our surety, or undertook to pay our debt, or suffer the penalty of the law in our stead. <i>Yet he opened not his mouth <\/i>\u2014He neither murmured against God for giving him up to suffer for other men\u2019s sins, nor reviled men for punishing him without cause, nor used apologies or endeavours to save his own life; but willingly and quietly accepted the punishment of our iniquity, manifesting, through the whole scene of his unparalleled sufferings, the most exemplary patience and meekness, and the most ready and cheerful compliance with his heavenly Father\u2019s will. <\/p>",
