Isaiah compares God to a potter and us to the pots; he compares God to a parent and us to a little child. The Lord has created earth and man, and he stands at the head of all the armies of heaven. Even the heathen will come to recognize his supremacy. With such power, the Lord can direct the events of earth as he desires\u2014and we would be wise to submit ourselves to his will.<\/i><\/p> ",
