But that promise was no longer in effect, and now Judah would be put to flight because she abandoned God.<\/p> <p><i>till ye be left as a <\/i> <i>beacon&hellip;and as an ensign.<\/i> Where there had once been a multitude living in a city, only a small remnant would be left. Although only a few of Judah's population would remain, they will still act as an <i>ensign<\/i> and <i>beacon,<\/i> or light to the world.<\/p> ",
