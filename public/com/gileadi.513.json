People may even superimpose human likenesses on them to make them more attractive but they, too, are God&rsquo;s creation, not theirs. In short, the sum total of the things they cherish that distract them from the true God amounts to no more than an illusion. When such substitutes for God become his people&rsquo;s obsession, then it is time for Jehovah to &ldquo;utterly supplant the false gods&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzA0XQ==\">Isaiah 2:18 <\/a>; cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxNzcwNl0seyIxNzk5MSI6Mn0sWzE4NDg5XV0=\">2:20; 17:7-8; 42:8 <\/a>). <\/p> ",
