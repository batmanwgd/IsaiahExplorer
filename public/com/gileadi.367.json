    "html": "<p>Before the millennial age, many of Jehovah&rsquo;s people &ldquo;suppose what is evil to be good and what is good, evil&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzYwXQ==\">Isaiah 5:20<\/a>), enabling impostors among them to command their respect. Although these form the top echelon of society, in Jehovah&rsquo;s eyes they are the lowest: &ldquo;Jehovah will cut off from Israel head and tail, palm top and reed, in a single day; the elders or notables are the head, the prophets who teach falsehoods, the tail. The leaders of these people have misled them, and those who are led are confused&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzg0NCI6M30=\">Isaiah 9:14-16<\/a>). The spiritual void they create leaves Jehovah&rsquo;s people vulnerable to disaster.<\/p><p>Most damning are the &ldquo;blasphemy,&rdquo; &ldquo;impiety,&rdquo; &ldquo;hypocrisy,&rdquo; and &ldquo;perverse things&rdquo; they pass off as the word of God. &ldquo;Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof&rdquo; (<a class=\"ref\">2 Timothy 3:5<\/a>), they offer Jehovah&rsquo;s people who come to be fed words that leave them empty (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODQ4MCI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 41:28-29<\/a>). Jehovah, therefore, holds them in derision: &ldquo;Predict the future for us: Tell us of events to come hereafter, so that we may know you are gods. Perform something good or evil at which we will be dazzled and all stand in awe. It is clear you are of no account, that your works amount to nothing&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODQ3NCI6M30=\">Isaiah 41:22-24<\/a>).<\/p>",
