Instead of their human knowledge teaching them that next to him they know nothing, they use it to gain acclaim or convert others to their opinion (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODI2Nl0seyIxODQ3NCI6M30sWzE4Njc0XV0=\">Isaiah 32:6; 41:22-24; 50:11<\/a>). In response, Jehovah &ldquo;turns wise men about and makes nonsense of their knowledge&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NTU5XQ==\">Isaiah 44:25<\/a>). As his Day of Judgment approaches, he performs &ldquo;wonder upon wonder, rendering void the knowledge of their sages and the intelligence of their wise men insignificant&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MjA4XQ==\">Isaiah 29:14<\/a>).<\/p>",
