    "html": "<p>When this takes place, Zion will be seized with the greatest delight, mingled with some trembling. <i>\u201cThen wilt thou see and shine, and thine heart will tremble and expand; for the abundance of the sea will be turned to thee, the wealth of the nations cometh to thee.\u201d<\/i> It is a disputed question whether the proper reading is<span class=\"normal hebrew\"> \ufb4a\u05e8\u05d0\u05d9<\/span> ,<span class=\"normal hebrew\"> \ufb4a\u05e8\u05d0\u05d9<\/span> , or<span class=\"normal hebrew\"> \ufb4a\u05d9\u05e8\u05d0\u05d9<\/span> - all three point to<span class=\"normal hebrew\"> \u05d9\u05e8<\/span>)- or<span class=\"normal hebrew\"> \ufb4a\u05e8\u05d0\u05d9<\/span> , from<span class=\"normal hebrew\"> \u05e8\u05d0\u05d4<\/span> . The last is favoured by the lxx, Targ., Syr., Jerome, Saad., and all the earlier Jewish commentators except AE, and is also the Masoretic reading; for the<i>Masora finalis<\/i> (f. 1, col. 6) observes that this<span class=\"normal hebrew\"> \u05e8\u05ea\u05d0\u05d9<\/span> is the only instance of such a form from<span class=\"normal hebrew\"> \u05e8\u05d0\u05d4<\/span> (differing therefore from<span class=\"normal hebrew\"> \u05ea\u05d9\u05e8\u05d0\u05d9<\/span> in <a class=\"ref\">Zephaniah 3:15<\/a> , where we also find the readings<span class=\"normal hebrew\"> \u05ea\u05d9\u05e8\u05d0\u05d9<\/span> and<span class=\"normal hebrew\"> \u05ea\u05e8\u05d0\u05d9<\/span>); and there is a note in the margin of the Masora,<span class=\"normal hebrew\"> \u05d7\u05d8\u05e3<\/span><span class=\"normal hebrew\"> \u05dc\u05d9\u05ea<\/span> , to the effect that this<span class=\"normal hebrew\"> \u05ea\u05e8\u05d0\u05d9<\/span> is the only one with<i>(<span class=\"translit\"> chateph<\/span>), i.e., <i>(<span class=\"translit\"> Sheva<\/span>). Moreover,<span class=\"normal hebrew\"> \ufb4a\u05e8\u05d0\u05d9<\/span> (thou shalt see) is the more natural reading, according to <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4OTM3XQ==\">Isaiah 66:14<\/a> and <a class=\"ref\">Zechariah 10:7<\/a>; more especially as<span class=\"normal hebrew\"> \u05d9\u05e8\u05d0<\/span> is not a suitable word to use (like<i>(<span class=\"translit\"> pa\u0302chad<\/span>) and<i>(<span class=\"translit\"> ra\u0302gaz<\/span>) in <a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 33:9<\/a>) in the sense of trembling for joy (compare, on the contrary,<span class=\"normal hebrew\"> \u05d9\u05e8\u05e2<\/span> , <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3OTY1XQ==\">Isaiah 15:4<\/a> , and<span class=\"normal hebrew\"> \u05e8\u05d4\u05d4<\/span> in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NTQyXQ==\">Isaiah 44:8<\/a>). The true rendering therefore is, \u201cThen wilt thou see and shine,\u201d i.e., when thou seest this thou wilt thine, thy face will light up with joy; (<span class=\"translit\"> na\u0302har<\/span>) as in <a class=\"ref\">Psalm 34:6<\/a>. Luther render it, \u201cThen wilt thou see thy desire, and break out,\u201d viz., into shouting; Jerome, on the contrary, has, \u201cThou wilt overflow, i.e., thou wilt be inundated with waters coming suddenly like rivers.\u201d<br> The impression produced by this revolution is so overpowering, that Zion's heart trembles; yet at the same time it is so elevating, that the straitened heart expands (<span class=\"normal hebrew\"> \u05d5\u05e8\u05d7\u05d1<\/span> , a figure quite unknown to the classical languages, although they have angor<\/i> and angustia<\/i> ; the lxx renders it<span class=\"greek normal\"> \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9\u0300 \u03b5\u0313\u03ba\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u0301\u03c3\u03b7<\/span> , after the reading<span class=\"normal hebrew\"> \u05d5\u05e8\u05d4\u05d1<\/span> in Chayug, and Isaac Nathan in his Concordance<\/i> , entitled<span class=\"normal hebrew\"> \u05e0\u05ea\u05d9\u05d1<\/span><span class=\"normal hebrew\"> \u05de\u05d9\u05e8<\/span>): for (<span class=\"translit\"> ha\u0306mo\u0304n<\/span>) (<span class=\"translit\"> ya\u0302m<\/span>), i.e., everything of value that is possessed by islands and coast lands ((<span class=\"translit\"> ha\u0302mo\u0304m<\/span>), groaning, a groaning multitude, more especially of possessions, <a class=\"ref\">Psalm 37:16<\/a> , etc.), is brought to her; and (<span class=\"translit\"> che\u0304l<\/span>) (<span class=\"translit\"> go\u0304yim<\/span>), the property, i.e., (looking at the plural of the predicate which follows; cf., <a class=\"ref\">Haggai 2:7<\/a>) the riches (gold, silver, etc., <a class=\"ref\">Zechariah 14:14<\/a>) of the heathen, are brought into her, that she may dispose of them to the glory of her God. <br><\/i><\/p> ",
