Isaiah has challenged Ahaz to trust the Holy One of Israel, who has revealed himself to Isaiah. When Ahaz rejected that invitation and the offered sign of God\u2019s presence with his people, Isaiah announced that what Ahaz had trusted in place of God\u2014Assyria\u2014would turn on Judah and destroy it. But, demonstrating how genuinely trustworthy God is, the prophet then declared that God would give light in place of Judah\u2019s self-induced darkness\u2014light in the form of a descendant of David who would be \u201cGod with us.\u201d Furthermore, once Israel faced the fact that it was God who controlled her destiny and not Assyria, God would demonstrate that truth by destroying arrogant Assyria and bringing about a messianic kingdom of peace peopled not only with his own people but also with representatives of all the nations. Should such a God be trusted? Absolutely!<\/p>     <p>\u2003That is just the response we find in 12:1\u20136. God should be trusted simply because he is God, but how much more he should be trusted when we realize that he himself has turned his righteous anger to \u201ccomfort\u201d or encouragement. As on the shores of the Red Sea, the people can say what they have learned about God: He is \u201cstrength,\u201d he is \u201csong,\u201d he is \u201csalvation.\u201d Who would not trust such a God as this? Drawing \u201cwater from the wells of salvation\u201d is not only to avail oneself of the deliverance God has offered, but it is also to live out the implications of that salvation in obedience and witness, as Psalm 116:13\u201314 makes clear.<\/p>     <p>\u2003Just as the elements of hope in the introduction (2:1\u20135; 4:2\u20136) led us to believe, the immediate results of redemption and salvation (12:1\u20133) are witness to the nations (12:4\u20136). The same thing is true in microcosm in the prophet\u2019s own call. He was not cleansed so that he could enjoy the condition of being cleansed but so that he could declare God\u2019s word to the people.<\/p>     <p>\u2003Verse 4 gives a short course in the behavior of the believer: thanks, prayer, and witness. The witness is to what God \u201chas done\u201d and to the obvious conclusion: There is no one with a character (\u201cname\u201d) so high and holy as his. The witness is in the form of a song. Works like those the Holy One has performed cannot be proclaimed with a long face. They must be sung \u201cto all the world\u201d (v. 5).<\/p>     <h4>Bridging Contexts<\/h4>     <p>T<small>HIS CHAPTER IS BRIM-FULL<\/small> of evangelical theology. God is the One who initiates salvation. There is nothing that Israel did to earn God\u2019s grace toward them. If there was to be reconciliation, it would have to come from God. Trust (or faith) does not produce reconciliation but is a response to the reconciliation announced. As such, it is the only adequate response. When God himself has satisfied his own justice and invites us to trust him, what else can we do?<\/p>     <p>\u2003This means that our response must finally issue in songs. No other form of human expression so captures the whole human psyche as does singing. Furthermore, there is a continuity in the songs of Zion that flows from the shores of the Red Sea to the shores of the \u201cglassy sea\u201d around which all the saints will gather:<\/p>     <blockquote>         <p>You are worthy to take the scroll<\/p>         <p>\u2003and to open its seals,<\/p>         <p>because you were slain,<\/p>         <p>\u2003and with your blood you purchased men for God<\/p>         <p>\u2003from every tribe and language and people and nation.<\/p>         <p>You have made them to be a kingdom<\/p>         <p>\u2003and priests to serve our God,<\/p>         <p>and they will reign on the earth. (Rev. 5:9\u201310)<\/p>     <\/blockquote>     <h4>Contemporary Significance<\/h4>     <p>C<small>HRISTIANS TODAY WHO THINK<\/small> about this chapter cannot help but reflect on the work of Christ. Paul says, \u201cIn Christ God was reconciling the world to himself\u201d (2 Cor. 5:19 <small>RSV<\/small>). That says it all. God reconciled us to himself through his own work on the Cross. Reconciliation is by nature a two-way street, but not in this case. There was nothing we could offer to God in the way of negotiation. We were condemned sinners, estranged from God and alienated from life (John 3:18; Eph. 4:18; Col. 1:21). But God found a way to satisfy his own justice in that Christ has died in our place. In place of judgment he has come to offer us encouragement.<\/p>     <p>\u2003It is no accident that the Holy Spirit is called the \u201cComforter\u201d in King James English. Unfortunately the word \u201ccomfort\u201d has become so watered down that we can no longer use it in contemporary translations. But \u201ccomfort\u201d in its original sense is exactly what God the Holy Spirit has come to do for us. He has come to enable us to stand before the Accuser and know ourselves forgiven. He has come to tell us all is not lost when we have failed again. He has come to enable us to stand before a mocking world with love and fortitude. None of this is in us but is in the power of Christ\u2019s cross and resurrection.<\/p>     <p>\u2003The story is told that in the late 1940s when the Indian constitution was being debated, an article prohibiting proselytization was proposed. But one legislator, who was not a Christian, rose and said that would involve them in self-contradiction. When asked why, he pointed out that they had already adopted an article guaranteeing freedom of religion and said that Christians <em>had to<\/em> seek converts; it was a part of their religion! The article prohibiting proselytization failed. Not only is this a characterization of Christianity, it is true of biblical religion as a whole (note Jesus\u2019 comment about the Pharisees\u2019 zeal for converts, Matt. 23:15). If God is the sole Creator of this world and if after we have alienated ourselves from him, he has found a way for us to come home again, that is news the whole created world needs to hear. How can we keep silent?<\/p>              ",
