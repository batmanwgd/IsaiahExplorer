    "html": "<p> But now all this had taken place. Instead of singing what has occurred, the tephillah places itself in the midst of the occurrence itself. <em> \u201cThy dead will live, my corpses rise again. Awake and rejoice, ye that lie in the dust! For thy dew is dew of the lights, and the earth will bring shades to the day.\u201d<\/em> The prophet speaks thus out of the heart of the church of the last times. In consequence of the long-continued sufferings and chastisements, it has been melted down to a very small remnant; and many of those whom it could once truly reckon as its own, are now lying as corpses in the dust of the grave. The church, filled with hope which will not be put to shame, now calls to itself, \u201cThy dead will live\u201d ( \u05de\u05ea\u05d9\u05da \u05d9\u05d7\u05d9\u05d5\u05bc , reviviscent, as in \u05d4\u05de\u05bc\u05ea\u05d9\u05dd \u05ea\u05bc\u05e1\u05d4\u05d9\u05bc\u05ea , the resurrection of the dead), and consoles itself with the working of divine grace ad power, which is even now setting itself in motion: \u201cmy corpses will rise again\u201d ( \u05d9\u05e7\u05de\u05d5\u05bc\u05df \u05e0\u05d1\u05dc\u05ea\u05d9 , <em> nebe\u0304lah <\/em> : a word without a plural, but frequently used in a plural sense, as in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzY1XQ==\">Isaiah 5:25<\/a>, and therefore connected with \u05d9\u05e7\u05de\u05d5\u05bc\u05df , equivalent to \u05ea\u05e7\u05de\u05e0\u05d4 : here before a light suffix, with the <em> e\u0302 <\/em> retained, which is lost in other cases). It also cries out, in full assurance of the purpose of God, the believing word of command over the burial-ground of the dead, \u201cWake up and rejoice, ye that sleep in the dust,\u201d and then justifies to itself this believing word of command by looking up to Jehovah, and confessing, \u201cThy dew is dew born out of (supernatural) lights,\u201d as the dew of nature is born out of the womb of the morning dawn (<a class=\"ref\">Psalms 110:3<\/a>). Others render it \u201cdew upon herbs,\u201d taking \u05d0\u05d5\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea as equivalent to \u05d9\u05e8\u05e7\u05d5\u05ea , as in <a class=\"ref\">2 Kings 4:39<\/a>. We take it as from \u05d0\u05d5\u05e8\u05d4 (<a class=\"ref\">Psalms 139:12<\/a>), in the sense of \u05d4\u05d7\u05d9\u05bc\u05d9\u05dd \u05d0\u05d5\u05e8 . The plural implies that there is a perfect fulness of the lights of life in God (\u201cthe Father of lights,\u201d <a class=\"ref\">James 1:17<\/a>). Out of these there is born the gentle dew, which gives new life to the bones that have been sown in the ground (<a class=\"ref\">Psalms 141:7<\/a>) - a figure full of mystery, which is quite needlessly wiped away by Hofmann's explanation, viz., that it is equivalent to <em> tal ho\u0304ro\u0304th <\/em> , \u201cdew of thorough saturating.\u201d Luther, who renders it, \u201cThy dew is a dew of the green field,\u201d stands alone among the earlier translators. The Targum, Syriac, Vulgate, and Saad. all render it, \u201cThy dew is light dew;\u201d and with the uniform connection in which the Scriptures place <em> 'or <\/em> (light) and <em> c hayy\u0131\u0304m <\/em> (life), this rendering is natural enough. We now translate still further, \u201cand the earth (<em> va\u0302'a\u0302retz <\/em> , as in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4OTE1LDE3MTE3XQ==\">Isaiah 65:17; Proverbs 25:3<\/a>, whereas \u05d5\u05d0\u05e8 \u05e5 is almost always in the construct state) will bring shades to the day\u201d (<em> hippil <\/em> , as a causative of <em> na\u0302phal <\/em> , <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTQ5XQ==\">Isaiah 26:18<\/a>), i.e., bring forth again the dead that have sunken into it (like Luther's rendering, \u201cand the land will cast out the dead\u201d - the rendering of our English version also: Tr.). The dew from the glory of God falls like a heavenly seed into the bosom of the earth; and in consequence of this, the earth gives out from itself the shades which have hitherto been held fast beneath the ground, so that they appear alive again on the surface of the earth. Those who understand <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTQ5XQ==\">Isaiah 26:18<\/a> as relating to the earnestly descried overthrow of the lords of the world, interpret this passage accordingly, as meaning either, \u201cand thou castest down shades to the earth\u201d ( \u05d0\u05e8 \u05e5 , <em> acc. loci ,<\/em> = \u05e2\u05d3\u05be\u05d0\u05e8 \u05e5 , <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTM2XQ==\">Isaiah 26:5<\/a>, \u05dc\u05d0\u05e8 \u05e5 , <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTMxXQ==\">Isaiah 25:12<\/a>), or, \u201cand the earth causeth shades to fall,\u201d i.e., to fall into itself. This is Rosenm\u00fcller's explanation (<em> terra per prosopopaeiam <\/em> , <em> ut supra <\/em> <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTE2XQ==\">Isaiah 24:20<\/a>, <em> inducta <\/em> , <em> deturbare in orcum sistitur impios <\/em> , <em> eo ipso manes eos reddens <\/em> ). But although <em> rephaim <\/em> , when so interpreted, agrees with <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTQ1XQ==\">Isaiah 26:14<\/a>, where this name is given to the oppressors of the people of God, it would be out of place here, where it would necessarily mean, \u201cthose who are just becoming shades.\u201d But, what is of greater importance still, if this concluding clause is understood as applying to the overthrow of the oppressors, it does not give any natural sequence to the words, \u201cdew of the lights is thy dew;\u201d whereas, according to our interpretation, it seals the faith, hope, and prayer of the church for what is to follow. When compared with the New Testament Apocalypse, it is \u201cthe first resurrection\u201d which is here predicted by Isaiah. The confessors of Jehovah are awakened in their graves to form one glorious church with those who are still in the body. In the case of Ezekiel also (Ez. <a class=\"ref\">Ezekiel 37:1-14<\/a>), the resurrection of the dead which he beholds is something more than a figurative representation of the people that were buried in captivity. The church of the period of glory on this side is a church of those who have been miraculously saved and wakened up from the dead. Their persecutors lie at their feet beneath the ground.<\/p>",
