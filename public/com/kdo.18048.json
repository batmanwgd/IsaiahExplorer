    "html": "<p> The figures in  now lead to the thought that the servant of God will never be extinguished or become broken Himself. <em> \u201cHe will not become faint or broken, till He establish right upon earth, and the islands wait for His instruction.\u201d<\/em> As \u05d9\u05db\u05d4\u05d4 (become faint) points back to \u05db\u05d4\u05d4 \u05e4\u05e9\u05c1\u05ea\u05d4 (the finat or glimmering wick), so \u05d9\u05e8\u05bc\u05d5 \u05e5 must point back to \u05e8\u05e6\u05d5\u05bc \u05e5 \u05e7\u05e0\u05d4 (the bruised or broken reed); it cannot therefore be derived from \u05e8\u05d5\u05bc \u05e5 (to run) in the sense of \u201cHe will not be rash or impetuous, but execute His calling with wise moderation,\u201d as Hengstenberg supposes, but as in <a class=\"ref\">Ecclesiastes 12:6<\/a>, from \u05e8\u05e6 \u05e5 = \u05d9\u05e8 \u05e5 (Ges. \u00a767, Anm. 9), in the neuter sense of <em> infringetur <\/em> (will break). His zeal will not be extinguished, nor will anything break His strength, till He shall have secured for right a firm standing on the earth ( \u05d9\u05e9\u05c2\u05d9\u05dd is a <em> fut. ex.<\/em> so far as the meaning is concerned, like \u05d9\u05d1\u05e6\u05bc\u05e2 in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODYzXQ==\">Isaiah 10:12<\/a>). The question arises now, whether what follows is also governed by \u05e2\u05d3 , in the sense of \u201cand until the islands shall have believed his instruction,\u201d as Hitzig supposes; or whether it is an independent sentence, as rendered by the lxx and in <a class=\"ref\">Matthew 12:21<\/a>. We prefer the latter, both because of <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4Njc5XQ==\">Isaiah 51:5<\/a>, and also because, although \u05dc\u05d3\u05d1\u05e8 \u05d4 \u05d9\u05d7\u05dc may certainly mean to exercise a believing confidence in the word of God (<a class=\"ref\">Psalms 119:74, Psalms 119:81<\/a>), \u05dc\u05ea\u05d5\u05e8\u05ea\u05d5 \u05d9\u05d7\u05dc can only mean \u201cto wait with longing for a person's instruction\u201d (<a class=\"ref\">Job 29:23<\/a>), and especially in this case, where no thought is more naturally suggested, than that the messenger to the Gentile world will be welcomed by a consciousness of need already existing in the heathen world itself. There is a <em> gratia praeparans <\/em> at work in the Gentile world, as these prophecies all presuppose, in perfect harmony with the Gospel of John, with which they have so much affinity; and it is an actual fact, that the cry for redemption runs through the whole human race, i.e., an earnest longing, the ultimate object of which, however unconsciously, is the servant of Jehovah and his instruction from Zion (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3Njg5XQ==\">Isaiah 2:3<\/a>) - in other words, the gospel.<\/p>",
