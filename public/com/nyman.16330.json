This is apparently similar to the situation which came upon the wicked Nephites four years before the Savior visited them. The people divided one against the other and separated into tribes according to families, kindreds, and friends, not as a righteous patriarchal division but as an attempt for survival. (See <a class=\"ref\">3 Ne. 7:1-14<\/a>.)<\/p>     ",
