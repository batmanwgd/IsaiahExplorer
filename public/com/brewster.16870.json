However, another states: \"The latter time is a future period when God will 'be heavy' (from the Hebrew root, <i>kaved<\/i>) with the land. Translators differ as to the meaning of this term, saying variously that God will 'make glorious,' 'deal heavily' \u2026 , or 'grievously afflict' \u2026 the area. Besides the unsurety of what the Lord's actions will be, the precise time of this manifestation is not presented, and, for unknown reasons, the land area to be affected in the latter time is larger than that which was anciently attacked by the Assyrians.\" (IPSP, 152.)<\/p>",
