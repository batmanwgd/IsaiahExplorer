    "html": " <p> <em>The present \"A gift\"\u2014<\/em>, The Egyptians were in alliance with the kingdom of Judah, and were fellow-sufferers with the Jews under the invasion of their common enemy Sennacherib; and so were very nearly interested in the great and miraculous deliverance of that kingdom, by the destruction of the Assyrian army. Upon which wonderful event it is said, <a class=\"ref\">2 Chronicles 32:23<\/a>, that \"many brought gifts unto Jehovah to Jerusalem, and presents to Hezekiah king of Judah; so that he was magnified of all nations from henceforth.\" It is not to be doubted, that among these the Egyptians distinguished themselves in their acknowledgments on this occasion. <\/p>\n\n <p> <em>Of a people \"From a people\"\u2014<\/em>, Instead of <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05e2\u05dd <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, am<\/span>, a people, the Septuagint and Vulgate read <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05de\u05e2\u05dd <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, meam<\/span>, from a people, which is confirmed by the repetition of it in the next line. The difference is of importance; for if this be the true reading, the prediction of the admission of Egypt into the true Church of God is not so explicit as it might otherwise seem to be. However, that event is clearly foretold at the end of the next chapter.\u2014L. <\/p>",
