The Lord also used a description of this \"armor\" in a revelation to Joseph Smith (see <a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 27:15-18<\/a>). However, this verse in Isaiah refers to the Lord's putting armor on himself to pour out vengeance, while the New Testament and the Doctrine and Covenants speak of the Saints' arming themselves to \"withstand the evil day.\"<\/p>     ",
