But unlike the others, where a song of praise forms the conclusion of the commentary (cf. 42:10\u201313; 49:13; perhaps 51:7\u20138), here the entire commentary (chs. 54\u201355) has a lyrical quality. As I observed at the beginning of the subdivision of Isaiah 49\u2013 55 (see comments on ch. 49), the tone of chapters 54\u201355 reflects the assurance that God\u2019s promises to restore his people to himself in chapters 49\u201352 have come to their fulfillment. Now anticipation changes to invitation and celebration. To be sure, the revelation in God\u2019s Son to make this reconciliation possible will not take place for nearly seven hundred years. Nevertheless, the revelation is now complete, and those who accept the promise can enjoy that reconciliation in advance.<\/p>     <p>\u2003In reality Isaiah 54\u201355 forms two parts of a single whole. Chapter 54 is a love song by God to Zion, his estranged bride, telling her all the things he is going to do in restoring her. Chapter 55 is the invitation proper, calling on the bride not to miss through unbelief what is hers. Together they constitute one of the most beautiful pieces of literature in the entire Bible.<\/p>     ",
