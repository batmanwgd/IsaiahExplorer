For the most part, all of those references were encouraging a blind and rebellious Israel to believe that God had not cast them off and that God would use them as evidence in his case against the idols. The one exception was the second reference to \u201cservant\u201d (42:1\u20139). Here the Servant was announced as the obedient One who would bring God\u2019s justice to the nations and who would be a covenant to \u201cthe people.\u201d I argued there that this Servant was not the nation of Israel but Israel\u2019s ultimate Deliverer, introduced there before focusing again on the more immediate problem of the captivity in Babylon.<\/p>     <p>\u2003Now with that problem of the Exile having been thoroughly dealt with, however, we can return to address the second problem, the one that the Servant will solve. We can imagine Isaiah\u2019s readers saying, as they come to the end of what is now chapter 48, \u201cAlright, we\u2019re listening and we can believe that God can and will restore us from Babylon by means of Cyrus. But who can restore us to God? That\u2019s the real problem.\u201d Isaiah\u2019s answer is given in these verses. It begins with a continuation of the call to \u201clisten.\u201d The prophet is continuing to unfold God\u2019s plan, which calls for yet a further obedient, believing response. But now it is the Servant himself who calls for the entire world to listen to what he is going to reveal.<\/p>     <p>\u2003The first revelation is one of call and confidence. The Servant has no doubt of his call (49:1), his divine enablement (49:2\u20133), or his ultimate vindication (49:4). He has been called from the womb, so his vocation is no secondary thing. Furthermore, he is perfectly suited for whatever task God may have for him. Like a \u201csharpened sword\u201d or a \u201cpolished arrow\u201d he will accomplish exactly what God wants at the appointed time. There is no hint of blindness or rebellion in this Servant. Even though his servanthood seems futile (the first emergence of a theme that will grow in 50:4\u20139 and 52:13\u2013 53:12), he knows that God will not fail him.<\/p>     <p>\u2003The contrast with the nation is obvious here. But if that is so, why is the Servant specifically named \u201cIsrael\u201d in 49:3? This question has raised a great deal of controversy, which I cannot discuss in detail here. In general, there are three options: The passage is referring to the nation, to the prophet, or to some ideal Israel. As I have said, the descriptions here do not match what is said of Israel, and if there is any further question, 49:5\u20136 seals the issue: Israel cannot be the agent to restore Israel to God. As far as this person being the prophet himself, the language is far too sweeping to be applied to any ordinary human. This leaves only the third option, which I have already advocated above. The Messiah will be \u201cIsrael\u201d as Israel was meant to be. He will display the Lord\u2019s \u201csplendor\u201d (49:3) as an obedient Israel might have done, and in so doing, he will be the One \u201cwho restores the tribes of Jacob\u201d to the Lord.<\/p>     <p>\u2003How that will be done is left unanswered here, but it will be answered a few chapters later. Whatever it is will be so far-reaching that it will reach to the ends of the earth, including even \u201cGentiles\u201d in its scope (49:6). \u201cSalvation\u201d here corresponds to \u201cjustice\u201d in 42:1 and helps to amplify the meaning of \u201cjustice\u201d to divine order, as discussed there. For God to \u201csave\u201d the world means to bring it into the order he intended, and for God to bring about that order it is necessary for him to save it from the bondage sin holds over it.<\/p>     ",
