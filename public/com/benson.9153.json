By the swift messengers are meant, not any particular persons specially appointed to this office, but any of the usual conveyers of news whatsoever; travellers, merchants, and the like, the instruments and agents of common fame; these are ordered to publish this declaration, made by the prophet, throughout Egypt, and to excite their attention to the promised visible interposition of Providence.\u201d Thus Bishop Lowth; who further says, \u201cI suppose that this prophecy was delivered before Sennacherib\u2019s return from his Egyptian expedition, which took up three years; and that it was designed to give to the Jews, and perhaps likewise to the Egyptians, an intimation of God\u2019s counsels in regard to the destruction of their great and powerful enemy.\u201d <i>To a nation scattered <\/i>\u2014Or <i>stretched out,<\/i>, as many translate <span class=\"hebrew_text\">,\u05de\u05de\u05e9\u05c1\u05da\u05b0<\/span>,. \u201cEgypt, that is, the fruitful part of it, exclusive of the deserts on each side, is one long vale, through the middle of which runs the Nile, bounded on each side to the east and west by a chain of mountains, seven hundred and fifty miles in length, in breadth, from one to two or three days\u2019 journey: even at the widest part of the Delta, from Pelusium to Alexandria, not above two hundred and fifty miles broad.\u201d <i>And peeled <\/i>\u2014Or rather <i>smoothed,<\/i>, as <span class=\"hebrew_text\">,\u05d5\u05de\u05d5\u05e8\u05e9\u05c2<\/span>, may be rendered. This, Bishop Lowth thinks, \u201ceither relates to the practice of the Egyptian priests, who made their bodies smooth by shaving off the hair; or, rather, to the country\u2019s being made smooth, perfectly plain and level, by the overflowing of the Nile.\u201d <i>Terrible from the beginning hitherto <\/i>\u2014This also well suits the Egyptians, whose kingdom was one of the most ancient, and continued long to be extremely formidable. And they were wont to boast extravagantly of the antiquity and greatness of their kingdom, asserting that gods were their first kings, and then demi-gods, and lastly men. <i>A nation meted out and trodden down <\/i>\u2014Hebrew, <span class=\"hebrew_text\">,\u05d2\u05d5\u05d9 \u05e7\u05d5 \u05e7\u05d5 \u05d5\u05de\u05d1\u05d5\u05e1\u05d4<\/span>, <i>a nation of line, line, and treading down.<\/i>, See the margin. The prophet is here generally supposed to refer, 1st, To the necessity which the Egyptians were frequently under of having recourse to mensuration, in order to determine the boundaries of their lands, after the inundations of the Nile; which is thought by some to have given birth to the science of geometry; (Strabo, lib. 17;) and, 2d, To a peculiar method of tillage in use among them. \u201cBoth Herodotus and Diodorus say, that when the Nile had retired within its banks, and the ground became somewhat dry, they sowed their land, and then sent in their cattle to tread in the seed; and without any further care expected the harvest.\u201d <i>Whose land the rivers have spoiled <\/i>\u2014The word <span class=\"hebrew_text\">,\u05d1\u05d6\u05d0\u05d5<\/span>, here used, may either be rendered <i>spoiled,<\/i>, or <i>despised.<\/i>, It seems plainly to relate to the overflowing of the Nile; which, as it were, claims Egypt to itself, while it overwhelms with its waters the whole land, except the cities and towns, secured by the banks raised about them. It is true, this overflow is rather an advantage than a disadvantage to the land, as it renders it fruitful; nevertheless it puts the inhabitants to very great inconveniences during its continuance. <\/p>",
