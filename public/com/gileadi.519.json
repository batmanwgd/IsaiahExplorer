    "html": "<p>Because Jacob\/Israel is the category of Jehovah&rsquo;s people that needs redeeming from sin (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg1MjgiOjR9LFsxODc4OF1d\">Isaiah 43:22-25; 58:1<\/a>), it occasions a Song of Salvation when that occurs. The heavens and the earth, witnesses of the Sinai Covenant (<a class=\"ref\">Deuteronomy 4:26; 30:19<\/a>)&mdash;which were earlier called on to testify of his people&rsquo;s breaking the covenant (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NjU3XQ==\">Isaiah 1:2<\/a>)&mdash;are now witnesses of their renewing the covenant. As mountains, forests, and trees denote nations, cities, and peoples, respectively, Jacob\/Israel&rsquo;s redemption is a worldwide event. Jehovah is &ldquo;glorified&rdquo; when his people respond to his acts of love (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODQzLDE4ODQ3XQ==\">Isaiah 60:21; 61:3<\/a>).<\/p><p>Paradoxically, in spite of Jehovah&rsquo;s redeeming humanity from its sins (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODU1NiwxODUzMSwxODc0OF0seyIxODg3NSI6Mn1d\">v 22; Isaiah 43:25; 55:7; 63:8-9<\/a>), of all God&rsquo;s creations man most disappoints him in his thoughts, words, and acts (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODU1NV0seyIxODUyOCI6M30sWzE4NzQ5LDE4ODc3XV0=\">v 21; Isaiah 43:22-24; 55:8; 63:10<\/a>). Whereas the natural world&mdash;the &ldquo;mountains, forests, and all trees therein&rdquo;&mdash;continually glorifies him by fulfilling the measure of its creation, only man, as a consequence of the agency God gave him in the Garden of Eden, chooses to offend God and his creations through his transgressions. Conversely, when man finally fulfills the measure of his creation nothing glorifies God more.<\/p> ",
