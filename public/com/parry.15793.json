The Lord's mercy to David, which was a sure promise, is also given to all mankind through \"an everlasting covenant.\" The Lord's promise is that if David\u2014who had committed the two of the greatest sins (adultery and murder, through ordering Uriah's wrongful death)\u2014will be resurrected, all may have that same hope.<\/p> ",
