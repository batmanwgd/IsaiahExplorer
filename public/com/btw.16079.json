    "html": "  <p>  <b>2 Nephi 20:20. \"In that day\"<\/b> Isaiah switches from his present day to a future day and assures covenant Israel that in the future a remnant will return.  <\/p>  <p>  <b>2 Nephi 20:20. \"No more again stay upon him\"<\/b> Again, remember that \"stay\" means \"rely\" in Isaiah. Covenant Israel will not have to rely on their new captors or rulers but can rely on the Lord.  <\/p>  <p>  <b>2 Nephi 20:22. \"The consumption decreed\"<\/b> We often refer to something ablaze as being \"consumed\" by fire. The \"consumption\" decreed is the destruction of the wicked in the last days (see D&amp;C 87:6). The Prophet Joseph Smith taught the urgency of temple work in these words: \"The Saints have not too much time to save and redeem their dead, and gather together their living relatives, that they may be saved also, before the earth will be smitten, and the consumption decreed falls upon the world\" (<i>Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith,<\/i> 330).  <\/p>  <p>  <b>2 Nephi 20:24. \"Be not afraid of the Assyrian\"<\/b> It seems that whenever angels come to earth, they begin with the salutation, \"Fear not!\" Here again, the Lord reminds covenant Israel to exercise faith rather than fear.  <\/p>  <p>  <b>2 Nephi 20:26. \"A scourge for him\"<\/b> The Lord has a scourge or a punishment in mind for the Assyrians and reminds covenant Israel of past times when he has saved them from the Midianites and from Pharaoh's armies.  <\/p>  <p>  <b>2 Nephi 20:27. \"Because of the anointing\"<\/b> Covenant Israel will be protected because of the anointing or in other words, because of the power of the Messiah or \"the anointed one\" (notice footnote 27<i>b<\/i>).  <\/p>  ",
