They were probably a reservoir from which the fields were irrigated so as to be conspicuous for their verdure Eusebius (Onomast.) places it north of Zoar. The name appears to survive in the Wady en Nemeirah on the south-eastern shore of the Dead Sea (De Saulcy, Voyage, i. 284; Tristram, Land of Israel, 340). Beth-Nimrah appears as the name of a town in <a class=\"ref\">Numbers 32:36<\/a>). The desolation predicted was probably thought of as caused by the stoppage of the wells, one of the common acts of an invading army ( <a class=\"ref\">2 Kings 3:25<\/a>).<\/p> ",
