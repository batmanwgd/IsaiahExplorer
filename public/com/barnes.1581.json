    "html": "<p><em>To open the blind eyes<\/em>&mdash;This is equivalent to saying that he would impart instruction to those who were ignorant. It relates to the Jews as well as to the Gentiles. He would acquaint them with God, and with the way of salvation. The condition of the world is often represented as one of darkness and blindness. Men see not their true character; they see not their real condition; they are ignorant of God, and of the truths pertaining to their future existence; and they need, therefore, some one who shall enlighten, and sanctify, and save them.<\/p><p><em>To bring out the prisoners from the prison<\/em>&mdash;(Compare <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODg0NSI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 61:1-2<\/a>). This evidently refers to a spiritual deliverance, though the language is derived from deliverance from a prison. It denotes that he would rescue those who were confined in mental darkness by sin; and that their deliverance from the thraldom and darkness of sin would be as wonderful as if a prisoner should be delivered suddenly from a dark cell, and be permitted to go forth and breathe the pure air of freedom. Such is the freedom which the gospel imparts; nor can there be a more striking description of its happy effects on the minds and hearts of darkened and wretched people (compare <a class=\"ref\">1 Peter 2:9<\/a>).<\/p> ",
