In opposition to such vain confidence, the prophet enjoins trust in God, with whom the penitent and humble are sure to find acceptance, and from whom they should obtain temporal and spiritual deliverances, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODc3OSI6N30=\">Isaiah 57:13-19<\/a>. Awful condition of the wicked and finally impenitent, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4Nzg2XQ==\">Isaiah 57:20<\/a>, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4Nzg3XQ==\">Isaiah 57:21<\/a>. <\/p>\r\n\r\n <p>I shall give Bishop Lowth's translation of the two first verses, and give the substance of his criticisms with additional evidence. <\/p> <ol> The righteous man perisheth, and no one considereth; And pious men are taken away, and no one understandeth, That the righteous man is taken away because of the evil.\r\n\r\n<\/ol>, He shall go in peace: he shall rest in his bed; Even the perfect man: he that walketh in the straight path.",
