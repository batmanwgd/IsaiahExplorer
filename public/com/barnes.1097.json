    "html": "<p><em>They shall be left together<\/em> &mdash;The figure here is dropped, and the literal narration is resumed. The sense is, that the army shall be slain and left unburied. Perhaps the &ldquo;branches and twigs&rdquo; in the previous verse denoted military leaders, and the captains of the armies, which are now represented as becoming food for beasts of the field and for birds of prey.<\/p><p><em>To the fowls of the mountains<\/em> &mdash;Their dead bodies shall be unburied, and shall be a prey to the birds that prey upon flesh.<\/p><p><em>And to the beasts of the earth<\/em> &mdash;The wild animals: the beasts of the forest.<\/p><p><em>And the fowls shall summer upon them<\/em> &mdash;Shall pass the summer, that is, they shall continue to be unburied. &ldquo;And the beasts of the earth shall winter upon them.&rdquo; They shall be unburied through the winter; probably indicating that they would furnish food for the fowls and the wild beasts for a long time. On the multitude of carcasses these animals will find nourishment for a whole year, that is, they will spend the summer and the winter with them. When this was fulfilled, it is, perhaps, not possible to tell, as we are so little acquainted with the circumstances of the people in relation to whom it was spoken. If it related, as I suppose, to the people of Nubia or Ethiopia forming an alliance with the Assyrians for the purpose of invading Judea, it was fulfilled probably when Sennacherib and his assembled hosts were destroyed. Whenever it was fulfilled, it is quite evident that the design of the prophecy was to give comfort to the Jews, alarmed and agitated as they were at the prospect of the preparations which were made, by the assurance that those plans would fail, and all the efforts of their enemies be foiled and disconcerted.<\/p> ",
