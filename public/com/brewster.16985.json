The inhabitants of Sheol will be so surprised to see the now-powerless Lucifer that they will exclaim in disbelief, \"Is this the man that made the earth to tremble?\" Surely such a pitiful, powerless creature could not be the one who \"did shake kingdoms\" and wreaked such destruction on earth! (Such words could also be said of the king of Babylon, the once-powerful conqueror now reduced to the role of a serf.)<\/p>     <table>         <tbody>             <tr>                 <td>15 Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit.                     <br>                     <br>16 They that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee, and consider thee, <i>saying<\/i><u>,<\/u> Is this the man that made the earth to tremble, that did shake kingdoms<u>;<\/u>                     <br>                     <br>17 <u>That<\/u> made the world as a wilderness, and destroyed the cities thereof<u>; that<\/u> opened not the house of his prisoners?                     <br>                 <\/td>                 <td>15 Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit.                     <br>                     <br>16 They that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee, and <u>shall<\/u> consider thee, <u>and shall<\/u><i> say<\/i><u>:<\/u> Is this the man that made the earth to tremble, that did shake kingdoms<u>?<\/u>                     <br>                     <br>17 <u>And<\/u> made the world as a wilderness, and destroyed the cities thereof<u>, and<\/u> opened not the house of his prisoners?                     <br>                 <\/td>             <\/tr>         <\/tbody>     <\/table>",
