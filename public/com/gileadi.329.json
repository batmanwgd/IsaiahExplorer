When things reach that point&mdash;when a simple farmer&rsquo;s inspiration (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTkxLDE4MTk0XQ==\">vv 26, 29<\/a>) surpasses that of his people&rsquo;s leaders (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTcyLDE4MTgwXQ==\">vv 7, 15<\/a>)&mdash;Jehovah sets his house in order (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc2ODAiOjJ9LFsxODkyOV1d\">Isaiah 1:25-26; 66:6<\/a>). The terms &ldquo;wonderful counsel&rdquo; establish word links to Jehovah&rsquo;s servant&mdash;&ldquo;the man who performs my counsel&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NTk4XQ==\">Isaiah 46:11<\/a>), upon whom rests the &ldquo;spirit of counsel&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODg3XQ==\">Isaiah 11:2<\/a>), and who exemplifies the function of a &ldquo;wonderful counselor&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODM2XQ==\">Isaiah 9:6<\/a>).<\/p><p>Each poetic allegory (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODE4OCI6N30=\">vv 23-26, 27-29<\/a>) reiterates chapter 28&rsquo;s theme of the need for divine revelation and its lack among the people of Ephraim that leaves them unprepared for Jehovah&rsquo;s Day of Judgment. Parallel ending verses&mdash;&ldquo;His God instructs him, directing him in the proper procedure&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTkxXQ==\">v 26<\/a>) and &ldquo;These things originate with Jehovah of Hosts, whose counsel is wonderful, whose inspiration is surpassing&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTk0XQ==\">v 29<\/a>)&mdash;hark back to <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzY1NiI6MzF9\">verse 9:<\/a> &ldquo;Whom shall he give instruction? Whom shall he enlighten with revelation?&rdquo; and to Jehovah&rsquo;s taking steps to restore his revelation to &ldquo;those who believe it&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTgxXQ==\">v 16<\/a>).<\/p>",
