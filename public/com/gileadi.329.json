When things reach that point&mdash;when a simple farmer&rsquo;s inspiration (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">vv 26, 29<\/a>) surpasses that of his people&rsquo;s leaders (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg2NzAiOjF9XQ==\">vv 7, 15<\/a>)&mdash;Jehovah sets his house in order (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc2ODAiOjJ9LHsiMTg5MjkiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 1:25-26; 66:6<\/a>). The terms &ldquo;wonderful counsel&rdquo; establish word links to Jehovah&rsquo;s servant&mdash;&ldquo;the man who performs my counsel&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg1OTgiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 46:11<\/a>), upon whom rests the &ldquo;spirit of counsel&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc4ODciOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 11:2<\/a>), and who exemplifies the function of a &ldquo;wonderful counselor&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc4MzYiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 9:6<\/a>).<\/p><p>Each poetic allegory (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">vv 23-26, 27-29<\/a>) reiterates chapter 28&rsquo;s theme of the need for divine revelation and its lack among the people of Ephraim that leaves them unprepared for Jehovah&rsquo;s Day of Judgment. Parallel ending verses&mdash;&ldquo;His God instructs him, directing him in the proper procedure&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">v 26<\/a>) and &ldquo;These things originate with Jehovah of Hosts, whose counsel is wonderful, whose inspiration is surpassing&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">v 29<\/a>)&mdash;hark back to <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc2NTYiOjMxfV0=\">verse 9:<\/a> &ldquo;Whom shall he give instruction?
