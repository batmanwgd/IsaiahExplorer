    "html": "<p>             (11) I will lay thy stones with fair colours.\u2014The first germ of the idealising symbolism of the new Jerusalem. The language of <a class=\"ref\">Tobit 13:16-17<\/a>, shows the impression which it made on the Jews of the captivity. It takes its highest form, excluding all thoughts of a literal fulfilment, in <a class=\"ref\">Revelation 21:19-21<\/a>. The Hebrew word for \u201cfair colours\u201d indicates the kohl, the black powder of antimony, or manganese, used by women in the East on eyelids and eyebrows, so as to enhance the brilliancy of the eyes. (<a class=\"ref\">2 Kings 9:30, 1 Chronicles 29:2, Jeremiah 4:30<\/a>.) Here, apparently, it is used in the same way as the setting of the sapphires and other gems. For \u201cwindows\u201d read pinnacles.<\/p>\n <p>Sapphires . . .\u2014As with the choice of the twelve gems for the High Priest\u2019s breast-plate, it is probable that each stone, over and above its visible beauty, had a symbolical significance. Sapphire, e.g., represented the azure of the firmament, as the \u201csapphire throne\u201d of the Eternal (<a class=\"ref\">Exodus 24:10, Ezekiel 1:26; Ezekiel 10:1<\/a>), and the rubies (not \u201cagates\u201d) and carbuncles may, in like manner, have answered to the fiery glow of the Divine love and the Divine wrath.<\/p>",
