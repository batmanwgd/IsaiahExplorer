    "html": " <p> (13) Bring no more vain oblations.\u2014These were of the minchah class, the \u201cmeat-offerings,\u201d or, more properly, meal-offerings of <a class=\"ref\">Leviticus 7:9-12 <\/a>. This, with its symbolic accompaniment of incense (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4OTI2XQ==\">Isaiah 66:3 <\/a>), was the characteristic feature of the thank-offerings and peace-offerings. <\/p> \n <p>Incense is an abomination.\u2014The Hebrew word is not that usually translated \u201cincense,\u201d and is found in <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 66:15 <\/a> (\u201cincense,\u201d or sweet smoke, \u201cof rams\u201d), in connection with animal sacrifice. There does not appear, however, any adequate reason why we should take the minchah in any but its usual sense of meal-offering. The prophet brings together all the chief ritual phrases without an elaborate attention to the details connected with them. <\/p> \n <p>The new moons and sabbaths . . .\u2014The classification agrees with that of <a class=\"ref\">2 Chronicles 8:13 <\/a>: sabbaths, new moons, and solemn feasts.\u201d (Comp. <a class=\"ref\">Hosea 2:11 <\/a>). The term \u201cconvocation,\u201d or \u201cassembly,\u201d was specially applied to the Passover, the Feast of Weeks, and the Feast of Tabernacles (<a class=\"ref\">Leviticus 23:7; Leviticus 23:21; Leviticus 23:27 <\/a>). The religious revival under Hezekiah brought all these into a fresh prominence (<a class=\"ref\">2 Chronicles 31:3 <\/a>). In <a class=\"ref\">Colossians 2:16 <\/a> they appear together as belonging to the Judaising Essene Christians of the apostolic age. <\/p> \n <p>It is iniquity, even the solemn meeting.\u2014The Hebrew construction has the abruptness of indignation: \u201cThe new moon and sabbaths, and calling of assemblies . . . iniquity with a solemn assembly I cannot bear. This was what made the crowded courts of the Temple hateful to the messenger of Jehovah. \u201cIniquity\u201d was there. The character of a ruling caste is not changed in a day, and the lives of rulers and judges were under Hezekiah as they had been in the days of Ahaz, or at least in those of Uzziah. <\/p> ",
