    "html": "<p>This verse completes a chiasm, consisting of covenant curse (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTc5MTY=\">v 9<\/a>)&mdash;<strong>a<\/strong>1; covenant blessing (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTc5MTc=\">v 10<\/a>)&mdash;<strong>b<\/strong>; and covenant curse (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTc5MTg=\">v 11<\/a>)&mdash;<strong>a<\/strong>2. The antithetical nature of this mini-structure adds perspective to the relationship between good and evil, contrasting the consequences of righteousness and wickedness. Besides synonymously identifying the subject of <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">verse 9<\/a> with &ldquo;the wicked&rdquo; of <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">verse 11<\/a>, it defines &ldquo;disaster&rdquo; and &ldquo;calamity&rdquo; as &ldquo;the fruits of their own labors&rdquo;&mdash;this time of the wicked, not of the righteous. Once the righteous are gathered out from among the wicked, the wicked suffer calamity (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTg3Njc=\">Isaiah 57:1<\/a>).<\/p>",
