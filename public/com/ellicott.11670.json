    "html": " <p>,(15) So shall he sprinkle many nations . . .\u2014The words have been very differently rendered by, He shall cause to spring up, i.e., shall startle, He shall scatter, He shall fling away, or, Many nations shall marvel at him. On the whole, however, admitting the difficulty of the passage, the Authorised version seems preferable. The \u201csprinkling\u201d is that of the priest who cleanses the leper (<a class=\"ref\">Leviticus 4:6; Leviticus 4:17 <\/a>), and this was to be done by Him who was Himself counted as a leper \u201csmitten of God\u201d (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzE2XQ==\">Isaiah 53:4 <\/a>). We may probably trace an echo of the words in the \u201csprinkling clean water\u201d of <a class=\"ref\">Ezekiel 36:25 <\/a>,, in the \u201cblood of sprinkling,\u201d of <a class=\"ref\">Hebrews 10:22; Hebrews 12:24 <\/a>. Here it comes as an explanation of the paradox that the Servant of Jehovah was to bring in \u201cmany nations\u201d into the holy city, and yet that the \u201cuncircumcised and unclean\u201d were not to enter it (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4Njk4XQ==\">Isaiah 52:1 <\/a>). <\/p>,\n <p>The kings shall shut their mouths . . .\u2014The reverence, as in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NjQ0XQ==\">Isaiah 49:7 <\/a>,, <a class=\"ref\">Job 29:9; Job 40:4 <\/a>,, is that of silent wonder at the change which has passed over the suffering Servant. <a class=\"ref\">Wisdom of Solomon 5:1-5 <\/a>,presents an interesting parallel, the reference there being to the person of the ideal righteous sufferer. In that case, as in this, there was, so to speak, a transfiguration \u201cbeyond all that men looked for.\u201d <\/p>,",
