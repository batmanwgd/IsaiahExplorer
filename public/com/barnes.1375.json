    "html": "<p><em>O Lord<\/em> &mdash;This is a solemn prayer to Yahweh, made by the Jews in the apprehension of the invasion of the Assyrian. It is not meant that this prayer was actually offered, but it is a prophetic representation indicating the alarm of the Jews at his approach, and their disposition to throw themselves upon the mercy of God.<\/p><p><em>We have waited for thee<\/em> &mdash;That is, we have looked for deliverance from this threatened invasion from thy hand (compare the note at<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTM5XQ==\">Isaiah 26:8<\/a>).<\/p><p><em>Be thou their arm<\/em> &mdash;The arm is a symbol of strengh. It is used in the Scriptures as emblematic of the divine protection, or of the interposition of God in time of calamity and dancer<a class=\"ref\">Exodus 15:16; Job 40:9; Psalm 44:3; Psalm 77:15; Psalm 89:21; Psalm 98:1<\/a> . Lowth proposes to read &lsquo;our arm instead of &lsquo;their arm;&rsquo; and the connection would seem to demand such a reading. The Vugate and the Chaldee read it in this manner, but there is no authority from manuscripts for a change in the text. The truth seems to be, that Isaiah, impelled by prophetic inspiration, here interposes his own feelings as a Jew, and offers his own prayer that God would be the strength of the nation. The form, however, is immediately changed, and he presents the prayer of the people.<\/p><p><em>Every morning<\/em> &mdash;Constantly; at all times.<\/p><p><em>In the time of trouble<\/em> &mdash;Referring particularly to the trouble consequent on the invasion of the Assyrians.<\/p> ",
