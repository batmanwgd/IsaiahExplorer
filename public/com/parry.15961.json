    "html": " <i>rend the heavens\/mountains&hellip;flow down at thy presence.<\/i> To rend the heavens<i> <\/i>is to tear open the veil, so that God can be seen. Additionally, trembling, moving, and melting of mountains are manifestations of the presence of God (<a class=\"ref\">Ex. 19:18; Ps. 18:6-8<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 133:40-41<\/a>). Isaiah asks the Lord to come to the deliverance of his people, tearing open the veil and bringing the fervent heat of his glory, which will literally melt the mountains. These are images directly related to the Lord's second coming. This expression may have another meaning: The Lord has power over heaven and earth, and he has power over all other gods. In his coming, Jesus will throw down the mountains, which here may represent the temples of false gods.<\/p> ",
