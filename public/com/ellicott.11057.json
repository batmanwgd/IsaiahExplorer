    "html": "<p>             (18) In that day shall five cities in the land of Egypt speak the language of Canaan.\u2014The prophecy is, it will be noticed, parallel to that affecting Ethiopia in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 18:7<\/a>, and at least expresses the yearnings of the prophet\u2019s heart after the conversion of Egypt to the worship of Jehovah. Like the previous prediction, it connects itself with Psalms 87, as recording the admission of proselytes as from other countries, so also from Rahab (i.e., Egypt). The \u201cfive cities\u201d stand either as a certain number for an uncertain (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 30:17<\/a>; <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 17:6<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\">Leviticus 26:8; 1 Corinthians 14:19<\/a>), or possibly as the actual number of the chief or royal cities of Egypt. The \u201clanguage of Canaan\u201d is Hebrew, and the prediction is that this will become the speech of the worshippers of Jehovah in the Egyptian cities. There is to be one universal speech for the universal Church of the true Israel.<\/p>\n <p>And swear to the Lord of hosts.\u2014The oath, as in the parallel phrase of <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 45:23<\/a>, is one of allegiance, and implies, therefore, something like a covenant of obedience.<\/p>\n <p>The city of destruction.\u2014There is probably something like a play on the name of the Egyptian city On, the Greek Heliopolis, the City of the Sun (Heb., Ir-ha-kheres), and the word which the prophet actually uses (Ir-ha-cheres), the \u201ccity of destruction.\u201d The paronomasia, like in character to Ezekiel\u2019s transformation of On into Aven, \u201cnothingness,\u201d or \u201cvanity\u201d (<a class=\"ref\">Ezekiel 30:17<\/a>), or Hosea\u2019s of Beth-el (\u201chouse of God\u201d) into Bethaven (\u201c house of nothingness\u201d) (<a class=\"ref\">Hosea 4:15<\/a>), was intended to indicate the future demolition of the sun-idols, and is so interpreted in the Targum on this passage, \u201cBethshemesh (i.e., Heliopolis), whose future fate shall be destruction.\u201d The word for destruction is cognate with the verb used of Gideon\u2019s breaking down the image of Baal, in <a class=\"ref\">Judges 6:25<\/a>; and in Jeremiah\u2019s prophecy (<a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 43:13<\/a>), \u201cHe shall break the pillars in the house of the sun,\u201d we may probably trace an allusive reference to Isaiah\u2019s language. Other meanings, such as \u201ccity of rescue,\u201d \u201ccity of protection,\u201d \u201ccity of restoration,\u201d have been suggested, but on inadequate grounds. The Vulg. gives civitas solis. The LXX. rendering, \u201ccity asedek,\u201d apparently following a different reading of the Hebrew, and giving the meaning, \u201ccity of righteousness,\u201d was probably connected historically with the erection of a Jewish temple at Leon-topolis by Onias IV., in the time of Ptolemy Philom\u00eator, which for some two centuries shared with the Temple at Jerusalem the homage of Egyptian Jews. Onias and his followers pointed to Isaiah\u2019s words as giving a sanction to what their brethren in Palestine looked on as a rival and sacrilegious worship.<\/p>",
