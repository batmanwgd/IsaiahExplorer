    "html": "<p>That thou shalt take up this proverb against the king of Babylon.\u2014The prophet appears once more (comp. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzQxLDE3OTAyXQ==\">Isaiah 5:1; Isaiah 12:1<\/a>) in his character as a psalmist. In the mashal or taunting-song that follows, the generic meaning of \u201cproverb\u201d is specialised (as in <a class=\"ref\">Micah 2:4; Habakkuk 2:6; Deuteronomy 28:37, 1 Kings 9:7<\/a>, and elsewhere) for a derisive utterance in poetic or figurative speech. The LXX., singularly enough, renders the word here by \u201clamentation.\u201d <\/p>\n <p>How hath the oppressor ceased.\u2014If we take \u201cthe golden city\u201d of the English version as the correct rendering, it finds a parallel in the epithet of \u201cgold abounding\u201d applied to Babylon by \u00c6schylus (Pers. 53). The word so translated is, however, not found elsewhere, and the general consensus of recent critics, following in the wake of the Targum and the LXX., is in favour of the rendering, the task-master, or the place of torture. The Vulgate, how has the tribute ceased, expresses substantially the same thought. The marginal reading, exactress of gold, seems like an attempt to combine two different etymologies. <\/p>",
