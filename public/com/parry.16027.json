It may also be known as an ensign, whose purpose is to stand as a beacon to draw people to Zion.<\/p> <p> <i>I will send those that escape of them unto the nations&hellip;Tarshish, Pul, and Lud,&hellip;Tubal&hellip;Javan.<\/i> <i>Those that escape<\/i> may be the Lord's faithful who do not perish in the latter-day destruction sent by Jehovah (see also 45:20). They may also be those who escape the bondage of sin. It will be their mission to tell the nations of the power, love, and glory of Jehovah. The place names were the extent of the known earth in ancient times, symbolizing the truth that the Lord will reach unto the ends of the earth.<\/p> <p><i>Tarshish <\/i>may have been in Spain (60:8-9); <i>Pul<\/i> and <i>Lud<\/i> are both probably in northern Africa (<a class=\"ref\">Gen. 10:6,  13<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\">Jer. 46:9; Ezek. 30:5<\/a>) <i>Tubal<\/i> is probably in Asia Minor near the Black Sea (<a class=\"ref\">Ezek. 32:26; 38:2<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\"> 39:1<\/a>) and <i>Javan<\/i> is Greece (<a class=\"ref\">Ezek. 27:13<\/a>). <\/p> <p><i>that draw the bow.<\/i> Perhaps the missionaries will be called to places where their lives may be in danger.

The isles (or continents) to which the missionaries are sent do not know the true God, having neither heard of his fame nor seen his glory.<\/p> ",
