    "html": "<p>This chapter contains two short, sacred psalms, or hymns, and is an appropriate conclusion to the powerful messianic messages and images in <a class=\"ref\">2 Nephi 21<\/a> (Isaiah&rsquo;s description of the great latter-day servants and the millennial golden age). In fact, these inspirational psalms serve as the ideal capstone to all the chapters quoted by Nephi thus far (<a class=\"ref\">2 Nephi 12&ndash;21<\/a>), which focus on the problems and deliverance of the house of Israel. Isaiah speaks for all Israel as he gives thanks and praise to the Lord for providing salvation and millennial blessings.<\/p>\r\n<p>Numerous psalms of thanks and praise are found in the scriptures, especially in the book of Psalms. Giving thanks and praise are two different expressions of worship, whether through song or prayer. As scholars distinguish the two, <em>thanks<\/em> recognizes God for <em>what He does,<\/em> while<em> praise<\/em> recognizes God for what <em>what He is.<\/em> Isaiah expresses beautiful words of both thanks and praise as he reveals what people will say &ldquo;in that day&rdquo; (usually referring to the last days).<\/p>",
