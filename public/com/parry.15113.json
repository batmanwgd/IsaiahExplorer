These remaining olives represent the righteous who will remain after the destruction of the wicked, represented by the harvesting of an olive tree. On many occasions the prophets compare the harvest to the destruction of the wicked (<a class=\"ref\">Matt. 13:39; D&amp;C 86:4-7<\/a>). <\/p> <p><i>gleanings are left over after the grape harvest. <\/i>Only a few individuals will remain after the harvest or destruction of the world.<\/p> ",
