    "html": "          <p>Most commentators say this warning was given against the land grabbers of Isaiah's day. However, a careful analysis of the text, especially as translated in the Book of Mormon, implies a much broader concept than the obtaining of land by a few rich or aspiring individuals.<\/p>     <table>         <tbody>             <tr>                 <td>Woe unto them that join house to house, <i>that lay field to field,<\/i> till there be no place, that they may be placed alone in the midst of the earth!<\/td>                 <td>Wo unto them that join house to house, till there can be no place, that they may be placed alone in the midst of the earth!<\/td>             <\/tr>             <tr>                 <td>In mine ears said the Lord of hosts, Of a truth many houses shall be desolate, <i>even<\/i> great and fair, without inhabitant.<\/td>                 <td>In mine ears, said the Lord of Hosts, of a truth many houses shall be desolate, and great and fair cities without inhabitant.<\/td>             <\/tr>             <tr>                 <td>Yea, ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath, and the seed of an homer shall yield an ephah. (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzc0OCI6M30=\">Isaiah 5:8-10<\/a>.) <\/td>                 <td>Yea, ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath, and the seed of a homer shall yield an ephah. (<a class=\"ref\">2 Ne. 15:8-10<\/a>.) <\/td>             <\/tr>         <\/tbody>     <\/table>     <p>In the Book of Mormon text, the joining of \"house to house\" was a situation which would block the establishment of Judah or the house of Israel, for \"there can be no place, that they may be placed alone in the midst of the earth.\" This phrase and the joining of house to house both imply a form of central control. Referring to Isaiah's day and also as a warning to our own day, it appears that Judah was forfeiting her individual freedoms to a central governmentwhich was controlling the property. The result would be that Judah could not be \"placed alone\" but was to be scattered among the nations of the earth, which happened. (The Book of Mormon, for some unknown reason, leavesout the KJV phrase \"that lay field to field\".)<\/p>     <p>The Lord has always sought to gather his people, but when they have not hearkened to his commandments he has scattered them and left them desolate instead (see <a class=\"ref\">Hel. 7:17-19; 3 Ne. 10:4-7; Matt. 23:37-38<\/a>). The result of the scattering of ancient Israel was that many \"great and fair cities\" were left desolate, \"without inhabitant\" (verse 9). Furthermore, the agricultural production of the area almost ceased, as Isaiah warned (verse 10). The yield of \"ten acres of vineyard\" was prophesied to be only \"one bath\" (81\/4 gallons) and that of \"the seed of an homer\" (the equivalent of ten baths) only \"an ephah\" (the dry-measure equivalent of a bath). Thus the established vineyards would not be productive, as they would yield only one-tenth of the seed planted.<\/p>     <p>There is still a greater warning in these verses, however. In every dispensation the Lord has given the same commandment revealed to the Saints of this dispensation, to \"seek to bring forth and establish the cause of Zion\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 6:6<\/a>). As Zion can be established only upon the law of consecration and stewardship (see <a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 78:1-7<\/a>), and as consecration and stewardship must be based upon private ownership and individual initiative (see <a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 42:30-32; 51:1; 78:14<\/a>), individual freedoms and the private ownership of property must be carefully protected. The land of America was preserved for these very purposes (see <a class=\"ref\">3 Ne. 21:4<\/a>). Zion cannot be established in a socialistic society where individuals own nothing.<\/p>     ",
