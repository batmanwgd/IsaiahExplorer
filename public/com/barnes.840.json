    "html": "<p><em>For the vineyard...<\/em> &mdash;This is the application of the parable. God had treated the Jews as a farmer does a vineyard. This was &ldquo;his&rdquo; vineyard&mdash;the object of his faithful, unceasing care. This was his &ldquo;only&rdquo; vineyard; on this people alone, of all the nations of the earth, had he bestowed his special attention.<\/p><p><em>His pleasant plant<\/em> &mdash;The plant in which he delighted. As the farmer had been at the pains to plant the &ldquo;sorek&rdquo;<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzQyXQ==\">Isaiah 5:2<\/a> , so had God selected the ancient stock of the Jews as his own, and made the race the object of his chief attention.<\/p><p><em>And he looked for judgment<\/em> &mdash;For justice, or righteousness.<\/p><p><em>But behold oppression<\/em> &mdash;The word rendered &ldquo;oppression&rdquo; means properly &ldquo;shedding of blood.&rdquo; In the original here, there is a remarkable &ldquo;paranomasia,&rdquo; or play upon words, which is not uncommon in the Hebrew Scriptures, and which was deemed a great beauty in composition:<\/p><p>He looked for &ldquo;judgment,&rdquo; \u05de\u05e9\u05c1\u05e4\u05d8 mishpa\u0302t\u0323, And lo! &ldquo;shedding of blood,&rdquo; \u05de\u05e9\u05c2\u05e4\u05d7 mis&lsquo;pa\u0302ch; For &ldquo;rightousness,&rdquo; \u05e6\u05d3\u05e7\u05d4 tseda\u0302qa\u0302h, But lo! &ldquo;a clamor,&rdquo; \u05e6\u05e2\u05e7\u05d4 tse\u201ba\u0302qa\u0302h.<\/p><p>It is impossible, of course, to retain this in a translation.<\/p><p>A cry. A clamor&mdash;tumult, disorder; the clamor which attends anarchy, and covetousness, and dissipation<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxNzc0OF0seyIxNzc1MSI6Mn1d\">Isaiah 5:8, Isaiah 5:11-12<\/a> , rather than the soberness and steadiness of justice.<\/p> ",
