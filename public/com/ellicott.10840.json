The altar from which he took the \u201clive coal \u201c\u2014literally, stone, and interpreted by some critics of the stones of which the altar was constructed\u2014is commonly thought of as belonging, like that of <a class=\"ref\">Revelation 8:5; Revelation 9:13 <\/a>,, to the heavenly Temple which was opened to the prophet\u2019s view. There seems, however, a deeper meaning in the symbolism if we think of the seraph as descending from the height above the throne to the altar of incense, near which Isaiah actually stood. It was from that altar that the glowing charcoal was taken. What had seemed part of the material of a formal worship became quickened with a living power. The symbol became sacramental. So in <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 51:7 <\/a>,, the prayer of the penitent is \u201cPurge me with hyssop\u201d\u2014i.e., make the symbol a reality. Fire, it need hardly be said, is throughout the Bible the symbol at once of the wrath and the love of God, destroying the evil and purifying the good (<a class=\"ref\">Numbers 31:23; Malachi 3:2; Matthew 3:11; 1 Corinthians 3:15; Hebrews 12:29; 1 Peter 1:7 <\/a>). Isaiah passed, as it were, through the purgatory of an instantaneous agony. <\/p>,",
