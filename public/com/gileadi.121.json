Word links to subsequent predictions confirm that it is the king of Assyria who &ldquo;plunders&rdquo; and &ldquo;spoils&rdquo; Jehovah&rsquo;s people (cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODEyXQ==\">v 4<\/a>): &ldquo;I will commission him against a godless nation... to pillage for plunder, to spoliate for spoil&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODU3XQ==\">Isaiah 10:6<\/a>; cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgyODEiOjR9LHsiMTg1MDIiOjJ9LHsiMTg2NjEiOjN9XQ==\">33:1-4; 42:21-22; 49:24-26<\/a>). Truthful witnesses will testify that Isaiah predicted these things before they happened, so that people can&rsquo;t claim he said it after the fact. <\/p> ",
