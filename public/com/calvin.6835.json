    "html": "<p><i> Upon all the cedars of Lebanon<\/i> The allegory which is here introduced, about the<i> trees of Lebanon<\/i> and<i> the lofty mountains<\/i> , instead of obscuring, sheds light on the subject; for however high may be the wishes or endeavors of a mortal man, yet he will never be able to reach the height of the<i> mountains<\/i> and the<i> lofty trees, which<\/i> it is as easy for God to throw down as for a breath of wind to scatter the fallen leaves. Accordingly, in what may be called a painting, Isaiah shows to proud men how idle and foolish they are in believing that their elevation will be their defense. There is also an implied exaggeration, which must have contributed to heighten the terror. It cannot be supposed that God is actually angry with the mountains and trees, or that, having changed his purpose, he throws down what he has built up; but in the harmless creatures Isaiah holds out to view the judgment of God, in order more fully to convince wicked and unprincipled men that their presumption will not pass unpunished. Thus we see the reason why he mixes up the metaphors of<i> cedars, oaks<\/i> , and<i> mountains<\/i><\/p> ",
