Tyre shall recover its splendor at the termination of seventy years, the days of One king, or kingdom, by which must be meant the time allotted for the duration of the Babylonish empire, as otherwise the prophecy cannot be accommodated to the event, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODA5MyI6M30=\">Isaiah 23:15-17 <\/a>.
