Thus He hated each and all of the festivals that were kept in Jerusalem, whether the beginnings of the month, or the high feast-days (<em> m oadim <\/em> , in which, according to Lev 23, the Sabbath was also included) observed in the course of the month. For a long time past they had become a burden and annoyance to Him: His long-suffering was weary of such worship. <em> \u201cTo bear\u201d<\/em> ( \u05e0\u05e9\u05c2\u05d0 ), in Isaiah, even in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MDAxXQ==\">Isaiah 18:3<\/a>, for \u05e9\u05c2\u05d0\u05ea or \u05e9\u05c2\u05d0\u05ea ro , and here for \u05dc\u05e9\u05c2\u05d0\u05ea : Ewald, \u00a7285,<em> c<\/em> ) has for its object the seasons of worship already mentioned.<\/p>",
