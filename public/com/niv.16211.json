    "html": "               <p>G<small>OD\u2019S RESPONSE TO<\/small> this prayer comes through Isaiah and is recorded in 37:21\u201335. It appears in three parts, the first of which is addressed directly to Sennacherib (37:22\u201329). The second is addressed to Hezekiah (37:30\u2013 32), and the third is spoken of Sennacherib (37:33\u201335). If the message of the field commander betrayed a certain familiarity with Judean life and thought, this oracle shows remarkable familiarity with the Assyrian royal annals. Especially verses 24\u201325, which quote the boasts of Sennacherib, sound much like what appears in those annals. Possibly there were publicists with the Assyrian armies who circulated these kinds of poetic celebrations of Assyrian might. If so, Isaiah has picked up on them and uses them to show how foolish they are in the light of the reality of the living God.<\/p>     <p>\u2003The opening phrase \u201cthe Virgin Daughter of Zion\u201d (37:22) suggests that the Assyrian attack on Jerusalem is comparable to a dominant male seeking to rape a beautiful young girl. On the surface, there is nothing to keep him from carrying out his will. But Assyria, the would-be rapist, has not taken into account \u201cthe Holy One of Israel\u201d (37:23). Or rather, he has dismissed the \u201cLORD\u201d as being of no account. He has put himself on the level of God, lifting his \u201ceyes in pride\u201d and in the process blaspheming God by bringing him down to Sennacherib\u2019s own level. Once more we encounter the theme of the folly of self-exaltation on the part of the creature (cf. 2:6\u201322; 14:4\u201322; etc.). There is only One who is \u201chigh and lifted up.\u201d For anyone else to presume to that position is to invite destruction. As a result, the \u201cDaughter of Jerusalem\u201d will be able to toss \u201cher head\u201d in mockery at the mighty man as he runs away in ignominy.<\/p>     <p>\u2003Verses 24\u201325 seem to extol Sennacherib by reference to extremes. Verse 24 speaks of the \u201cheights\u201d he has scaled in the north (\u201cLebanon\u201d), while verse 25 speaks of the deep \u201cwells\u201d he has \u201cdug\u201d in the south (\u201cEgypt\u201d). Surely this man is the master of the world, from north to south and from heights to depths. He can fell the tallest trees and stop up the mightiest rivers. Nothing can stop him.<\/p>     <p>\u2003But what he does not know is that all of this has been \u201clong ago\u2026planned\u201d by the God of one of the little countries the Assyrian has so contemptuously trampled on (37:26). This theme of the plan of God in relation to Assyria has been encountered at least twice before (10:6, 15; 14:24\u201327). Not only is this not a contest between what the God of Israel wants and what Assyria wants, but the Assyrian is not even on the stage by his own volition. He is a puppet being moved by Israel\u2019s God! God has \u201cbrought it to pass\u201d that Assyria has conquered the \u201cfortified cities\u201d and reduced their inhabitants to wilted, \u201cscorched\u201d \u201cplants\u201d (37:27). As a result, Sennacherib cannot hide from God. Just as God has brought him on the stage, he can take him off again (37:28\u201329). To God, the mighty Assyrian monarch is no more than a bull with a ring in his nose or a horse with a \u201cbit\u201d in his mouth.<\/p>     <p>\u2003Verses 30\u201332 constitute a sign to Hezekiah that this is indeed a word from God. Like several of the other signs in the book (7:14; 8:3; 16:14), it is forward-looking. It does not create faith, but it promotes it in that God has gone on record that he will do what he says and has given a means for checking the veracity of what he has said. Probably the \u201cthree years\u201d is not three full years from the date of the prophecy but parts of three different calendar years. One possibility is that the Assyrians will retreat in the fall of \u201cthis year\u201d when it is too late for planting to take place. Thus, though the Assyrians will be gone in the next, or \u201csecond\u201d year, the only food plants growing will be those that come up on their own. Finally, planting can take place in the fall of that \u201csecond\u201d year, so that there will be plenty of food to be harvested in the \u201cthird\u201d year.<\/p>     <p>\u2003But in God\u2019s mind, the more important point is that he will preserve a harvest for himself from among his people (37:32). The Assyrian thought to devastate God\u2019s \u201cfield\u201d and take all the crop for himself. But although God has permitted a large measure of devastation to take place, he will not allow total destruction to occur. He has too great a passion (\u201czeal\u201d) for his people to allow that to happen. He will preserve a \u201cremnant\u201d for himself.<\/p>     <p>\u2003All God\u2019s promises are summed up in 37:33\u201335, where Isaiah makes two assertions about what will happen\u2014one negative (v. 33) and one positive (v. 34)\u2014and then gives a supporting reason for these assertions (v. 35). The negative assertion is that the Assyrian will not mount any kind of an attack against the city. Not only will they not conquer God\u2019s city, they will not even \u201cshoot an arrow\u201d there. On the surface of it, this is amazing. Hezekiah is the leader of the revolt; to leave him unpunished would send a bad message, from an Assyrian point of view, to all the other potential rebels in the area. But not only will the Assyrians not mount a siege against the city, they will leave the area completely (37:34). The reason given for this amazing turn of events is that God \u201cwill defend\u201d the city \u201cand save it.\u201d Sennacherib has said he will destroy the city, whereas God has said he will save it. Now we will see who is right.<\/p>     <p>\u2003Verses 36\u201338 are stunning in their terse, matter-of-fact reporting. They are so plain and unadorned as to be almost anticlimactic. Perhaps the point is to show that there is simply no contest here. This is not some earthshaking conflict between evenly matched contestants. This is definitely a \u201cno contest\u201d match. God simply sends the angel of death. Nor is the angel finished on the Philistine plains. Just because Sennacherib is at home in what should have been the safest place on earth for him (\u201cthe temple of his god\u201d), God\u2019s word is still true (37:7), and his rule is still effective. His own sons \u201ccut him down\u201d (37:38) and flee. Despite all his boasts, Sennacherib cannot stand against the living God. Hezekiah has proved that it is foolish to trust the nations in place of the living God, \u201cthe Holy One of Israel\u201d (37:23).<\/p>     <h4>Bridging Contexts<\/h4>     <p>T<small>HE PAGAN VIEW OF REALITY.<\/small> At the heart of this material is the conflict between the biblical view of reality and the pagan view. Yehezkel Kaufmann has shown that the pagan view of reality was rooted in the idea that the gods emerged from matter, were identical with its various forms, and were conditioned by it. Thus, they \u201ccorrespond\u201d with the natural realm and are indeed continuous with it. The thought that the gods might have come into existence before matter is simply unthinkable. Matter, existing in chaotic form, has always existed and always will, and the gods are the result of tensions in this stuff. Whether you call it \u201cYin\u201d and \u201cYang,\u201d or \u201cGood\u201d and \u201cEvil,\u201d or \u201cPositive\u201d and \u201cNegative,\u201d the point is the same.<\/p>     <p>\u2003Thus, the gods have no real freedom. They play the role assigned to them by their \u201cfate.\u201d The sun god cannot shine in the night; the moon goddess cannot shine in the day. Furthermore, the gods have no purpose when they \u201ccreate\u201d\u2014or perhaps more precisely, when they \u201cprocreate.\u201d They are to be understood by analogy with the world of nature, and just as nature is without purpose as it produces life, so are the gods without purpose. Since there is no purpose, there is no goal toward which they are moving. Life came from nowhere and goes nowhere.<\/p>     <p>\u2003This continuity with nature necessarily issues in idolatry. If the gods have emerged from matter and are conditioned by it, what could be more sensible than to represent them in material forms? Furthermore, the understanding of the correspondence between the gods and matter means that by manipulating the idol, I can manipulate the god and in so doing manipulate the natural force behind the god.<\/p>     <p>\u2003Kaufmann notes that the biblical writers never seem to pay attention to the deity behind the idol and argues forcefully how this shows a complete ignorance of the thought world of myth in the Bible. However, it seems to me that he has made too much of this evidence. To think that the Israelites were so isolated from the surrounding cultures that they did not even understand how those cultures thought is to ask far too much. To think that Elijah and Elisha did not understand how the Baal religion functioned presupposes an almost unbelievable obtuseness. Furthermore, when the Israelites fell into the worship of idols, it is unimaginable that they did not do so for the same reasons their pagan neighbors did: the attempt to manipulate the forces of nature with which the idols corresponded.<\/p>     <p>\u2003No, the reason the biblical prophets concentrate on the folly of making idols (see comments on 40:18\u201320; 42:17; 44:9\u201320) is that this is the Achilles heel of paganism. Rather than go into a complex (and abstract) argument on the nature of transcendence and continuity, they simply ask how a piece of stone or a block of wood can save us. Even though this argument seems simple, it has profound implications, for behind it is the much larger question: How can the natural system save us from the natural system? How can what manifestly has no purpose infuse our life with purpose? How can what is obviously without meaning give us meaning? Such things do not merit the title of \u201cgods.\u201d Thus, idolatry is the symptom, but by addressing the symptom, the biblical writers are necessarily getting us to focus on the disease.<\/p>     <p>\u2003Today, the disease is all around us, and the symptoms are beginning to reemerge. Many of the most intelligent among us insist on the eternity of matter. \u201cSpirit\u201d is only a by-product of electrochemical forces inherent in that matter, forces they might describe as \u201cpositive\u201d and \u201cnegative.\u201d They insist that all life is evolving but admit that they do not know why nor to what end. But there is also emerging a sense that there is more to reality than merely electrochemical forces, that we need to somehow \u201cpersonalize\u201d these forces. No longer is cold, impersonal reason a satisfactory basis for life. So we face the reemergence of the same conflict with which Hezekiah was faced. We must again ask whether the living God is any different from, or superior to, what this world calls \u201cgods.\u201d<\/p>     <p>\u2003<b>Human boasting.<\/b> The Assyrian kings did not suffer from false humility. In a report to his god Ashur, Sargon II (724\u2013705 B.C.) said the following words that sound a good deal like those Isaiah quoted:<\/p>     <blockquote>         <p>\u2003I put the armies of Shamash and Marduk across the Lower Zab, whose passage is difficult like a canal. I entered through the passes of Kullar, the high mountain of the land of Lulumi which they call Zamua\u2026 Ipassed through the midst of Nikipa and Upa, high mountains, which are covered with all kinds of trees, whose midst is chaos, whose passes are fearful, whose shade spreads over that region like a cedar forest so that one who goes through them does not see the ray of Shamash. I crossed over the Buya, a river between them, 26 times. My army in its mass did not fear the high waters.<\/p>     <\/blockquote>     <p>\u2003But when we think of the posturing in the ring by members of the World Wrestling Entertainment, these words sound almost modest. We may smirk and comment that the wrestlers, like their performances, are just so much air, a make-believe world for consumption by the gullible. But before we dismiss the spectacle too easily, we must remember that people pay large ticket prices to see these performances. This suggests that people in some way enjoy such posturing. It may suggest there is something we actually admire in it, and perhaps we secretly wish we could get away with such blatant self-promotion.<\/p>     <h4>Contemporary Significance<\/h4>     <p>H<small>UMILITY.<\/small> The Bible again and again speaks of God\u2019s preference for the lowly. Isaiah says in 57:15:<\/p>     <blockquote>         <p>For this is what the high and lofty One says\u2014<\/p>         <p>\u2003he who lives forever, whose name is holy:<\/p>         <p>\u201cI live in a high and holy place,<\/p>         <p>\u2003but also with him who is contrite and lowly in Spirit.\u201d<\/p>     <\/blockquote>     <p>\u2003Jesus says, quoting the Old Testament, \u201cBlessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth\u201d (Matt. 5:5). He says of himself, \u201cI am gentle and humble in heart\u201d (11:29). Peter follows up on this with the words: \u201cHumble yourselves, therefore, under God\u2019s mighty hand, that he may lift you up in due time\u201d (1 Peter 5:6). Yet, we see that the \u201cwinners\u201d in this world, like Sennacherib, are often masters at self-promotion and intimidation. A best-selling book of a few years ago was entitled <em>Winning Through Intimidation<\/em>, and many people learned to practice its techniques. Is the Bible hopelessly out of touch? Or is it the kind of thing we are expected to give a nod of approval to while admitting that it is not practical in \u201cthe real world\u201d?<\/p>     <p>\u2003Everything depends on whether we have really met God or not. For Sennacherib and the World Wrestling Entertainment performers, their lives and their futures are in their own hands. Their success depends completely on themselves. So the adage runs, \u201cIf you don\u2019t blow your own horn, nobody else will.\u201d The same will be true for all of us. We may try to find ways that are a little more socially acceptable than the braggadocio of the WWE, yet in the end we must carefully cultivate our own reputation and put ourselves forward. It is a matter of \u201cself-respect,\u201d we are told. It is a person with \u201cno backbone\u201d who lets oneself be walked on by others.<\/p>     <p>\u2003To be sure, there are persons who feel themselves to be worthless, who feel that they do not get any \u201cbreaks\u201d because they don\u2019t deserve any. There are also those who try to win our sympathy with a \u201cfalse modesty.\u201d They are constantly putting themselves down in such a way that we are forced to focus our attention on them as we try to assure them they are much more deserving and capable than they say. Neither of these are what the Bible has in mind with its teachings on humility. Hezekiah\u2019s responses are instructive. He does not bandy words with the oppressor. His first instructions to his representatives is that they are to keep silent (37:21). He is not going to get into a shouting match. He is not going to try to say that he is better or that what they say about themselves is untrue. He refuses to play the game of one-upmanship.<\/p>     <p>\u2003Then he takes his concerns to the Lord. He has put his reputation in the hands of God. This is the key. A person who responds to the love of God knows a number of things, according to 1 John 5. We know how much we are worth: the life of the Son of God (5:11\u201312). We know that pulsating in us is eternal life (5:13). We know that we have instant access to the throne room of our Father (5:14\u201315). We know that we can live lives like God (5:18). We know that we are in a life-and-death battle with the powers presently ruling this world (5:19). We know that Jesus has given us the power to understand the issues in the battle and to remain true (5:20).<\/p>     <p>\u2003The person who knows all these things does not have to brag and pose. But neither does he or she have to go through life with a \u201changdog\u201d expression. We are infinitely valuable to God, and our future, both near-term and long-term, is secure in God\u2019s hands. If he is who he says he is, then we do not have to worry about our \u201cimage.\u201d Instead, we canconcentrate on reality: \u201cattaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ\u201d (Eph. 4:13).<\/p>     <p>\u2003Paul defines this kind of attitude as \u201cmaturity.\u201d And surely this is maturity: having a correct estimate of your abilities and your liabilities, one that is not dependent on the opinions of others, and being secure in who you are and who you are becoming. But this is not really possible without the perspective of heaven. When we get ourselves \u201coff our hands\u201d and into God\u2019s hands, we no longer need to worry about how we are looking. Now it is God\u2019s reputation that matters to us, and we are freed from that debilitating self-concern that will otherwise eat us up. That is the picture we see in Hezekiah\u2019s prayer. Here is a man whose personal success and survival are no longer paramount. This is a free man.<\/p>     <p>\u2003<b>Prayer versus ritual manipulation.<\/b> Pagan ways of thinking have an insidious way of slipping into our practices without our being aware of it. Perhaps this is so because even in our highest spiritual achievements, we remain the fallen children of Adam and Eve. I do not want to suggest that economic theory is inherently evil, but there is something slightly perverse about our constant wish to get the greatest return for the smallest outlay. We do not easily or naturally ask, \u201cWhere can I make the greatest contribution?\u201d Instead it is, \u201cWhere can I get the biggest return with the least input from me?\u201d<\/p>     <p>\u2003This is what drives the gambling instinct, and this is what drives pagan thought. Pagan thought says, \u201cI know what my needs are, and I must find the means to supply those needs at the least cost to myself.\u201d Biblical thought says, \u201cYour transcendent Creator-Father knows what your needs are and wants to supply them out of his bounty. In order to receive that supply, give yourself away to him without reservation.\u201d Our answer is the same as Adam and Eve\u2019s, and as the man who was given one talent said (Matt. 25:25): \u201cWe\u2019re afraid of you.\u201d The price God asks seems too high. Maybe he will take our all and give nothing back. So the pagan option looks good. We will find ways to manipulate God and make him give us what we want\/need while keeping ourselves for ourselves.<\/p>     <p>\u2003When we begin to do this, much of our religious life begins to change its complexion. We go to church, we read the Bible, we tithe, we pray, we reject sin\u2014all as a means of manipulating God. Slowly but surely these behaviors begin to take on the shape of idolatry. The physical acts become the spiritual reality. Current bestsellers on prayer have this real potential. We are encouraged to repeat a specific biblical prayer over and over, using the precise words of the biblical text, with the promise that in so doing we will receive the blessings of God. It may not be the intention of the authors of these books, but quickly humans see such a prayer as a mechanical device whose purpose is to get the maximum out of God with the minimum of an investment of themselves.<\/p>     <p>\u2003The Hebrew prophets destroy such an idea. Again and again they weigh in against it. Isaiah has already done so in the first chapter and will do so again in chapter 58. Unlike pagan religious activity, biblical rites have no efficacy in and of themselves. They are symbols of interpersonal relationships between God and the worshiper. Jesus makes this point when he says we are not to pray like pagans who believe that they will be heard because they repeat a rote formula (Matt. 6:7).<\/p>     <p>\u2003Another illustration can be found in the parable of the Pharisee and the tax collector. One man\u2019s prayer was heard and the other\u2019s was not, and the hearing and not hearing were dependent on the attitude of the person\u2019s heart (Luke 18:14\u201319). One of the reasons the prophets so often call for activity on behalf of the poor as the sign of true religion is because it is hard to turn this into a manipulative activity. It requires too much investment with too little evident return.<\/p>     <p>\u2003Hezekiah\u2019s prayer is a wonderful antidote to pagan prayer. He is far from trying to manipulate God. He does not suggest that God owes him or his people anything. He focuses on God\u2019s character and nature. Neither does he promise to do anything for God if God delivers them. He is concerned that God be known properly in the world and wants for that to happen in the context of the oppressor\u2019s boast, for that is the level on which this conflict has been pitched. Hezekiah places himself and his people in the position of simple trust. He cannot make God bless them and does not try. Rather, he commits himself to God without any qualifications or caveats.<\/p>     <p>\u2003We, too, can pray and live in this way. We can give ourselves to God absolutely and without limit. As we continue in the Christian life, we will discover ever deeper levels where that earlier surrender will have to be actualized, but that does not diminish the reality or the completeness of that first moment of total, unreserved trust. In such a relationship, we can surrender our needs to God. To be sure, he invites us to tell him what we think our needs are because our trust is deepened as we see God providing the very things we asked for. But that does not mean that we demand he work for us. It means we lay our supposed needs at his feet for him to supply as he sees best. This kind of prayer is no longer an exercise in manipulation. Now it is a conversation between a trusting child and a loving Father.<\/p>     <p>\u2003<b>The God of history.<\/b> The Bible makes human historical experience the arena in which God is revealed. This is startlingly different from the pagan understanding. While pagans believed their gods acted in history on behalf of their favorites, they had no concept of an overarching plan or purpose, nor did they believe anything of the gods\u2019 natures could be learned from such experience. It was in the recurring cycles of nature that the gods were truly seen. Thus, the idea of keeping a record of God\u2019s activities in human history and his inspired interpretations of the meaning of those activities is something unique to the Bible.<\/p>     <p>\u2003In a real sense, then, God was revealing himself by incarnation long before Jesus Christ was born. Jesus was the culmination of what God had been doing from the outset. The Hebrews are able to say to us, \u201cWe know God and commend him to you because we have seen him at work in the context of our experience.\u201d Some writers would say that God was no more at work in Israelite history than he was in Canaanite history but that the Israelites just chose the vehicle of human history to express their faith. This is not the place for a lengthy discussion on the subject; suffice it to say here that unless the Hebrews had continuing and convincing evidence that God was doing this, there is no satisfactory explanation as to why they chose this mode of expression. None of their more sophisticated and thoughtful neighbors did such a thing.<\/p>     <p>\u2003Thus, it continues to be of critical significance whether the historical claims the biblical writers make are correct. If they are not, then there is every reason to abandon the strange faith of the Bible. It flies directly in the face of the way in which reality has been otherwise viewed around the world, and if it is only the bizarre creation of the Israelites, we ought to, as Paul says, give it up. However, if the biblical writers\u2019 testimony is not their own creation but an honest report of what actually happened, then regardless of the popular view or even the majority view, their religious conclusions are inescapable, and we must, like the Christians in the Colosseum, stand on them.<\/p>     ",
