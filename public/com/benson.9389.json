The Jews were diligent in performing the external services of religion; in offering prayers, incense, sacrifices, oblations; but their prayers were not offered with faith, and their oblations were made more frequently to their idols than to the God of their fathers.\u201d <i>Neither hast thou honoured me <\/i>\u2014 If thou didst not neglect sacrificing to me, thou didst perform that duty merely out of custom; or didst dishonour me, and pollute thy sacrifices by thy wicked life. <i>I have not wearied thee <\/i>\u2014 Or, <i>Although I have not wearied thee, <\/i>&c. Although God had not laid such heavy burdens upon them, nor required such costly offerings, as might give them cause to be weary, nor such as idolaters did freely perform in the service of their idols. <i>Thou hast brought me no sweet cane <\/i>\u2014 This was used in the making of that precious ointment, (<a class=\"ref\">Exodus 30:34<\/a>,) and for the incense, <a class=\"ref\">Exodus 30:7<\/a>. See <a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 6:20<\/a>. Thou hast been niggardly in my service, when thou hast spared for no cost in the service of thine idols. <i>Nor filled me, <\/i>&c. \u2014 Thou hast not multiplied thy thank-offerings and free-will-offerings, though I have given thee sufficient occasion to do so. <i>But thou hast made me serve, <\/i>&c. \u2014 Thou hast made me to bear the load and burden of thy sins.<\/p>",
