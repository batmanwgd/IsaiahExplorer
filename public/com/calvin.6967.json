Accordingly, when<i>Rezin<\/i> had been slain, ( <a class=\"ref\">2 Kings 16:9<\/a> ,) that country was entirely ruined. Still more does he heighten this, by adding, <i>he shall mingle<\/i> ; for he means that the Lord will gather together and<i>mingle<\/i> various enemies whom he will commission to destroy the king of Syria, as the soldiers who composed the army of that vast monarchy were collected out of various nations.<\/p> ",
