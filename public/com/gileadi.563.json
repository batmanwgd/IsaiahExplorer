Jehovah&rsquo;s &ldquo;naming&rdquo; him and &ldquo;calling&rdquo; him to an international mission&mdash;to &ldquo;the isles&rdquo; and &ldquo;distant people&rdquo;&mdash;signify ascent to the seraph category. Jehovah had likewise called Jeremiah to an international mission before his birth: &ldquo;Before I formed you in the belly, I knew you. Before you came out of the womb, I sanctified you. I ordained you a prophet to the nations&rdquo; ( <a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 1:5, 10<\/a>).<\/p> ",
