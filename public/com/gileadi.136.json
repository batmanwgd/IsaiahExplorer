Part III of Isaiah&rsquo;s Seven-Part Structure (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxNzg0Ml0seyIxODQ1MyI6MTQ4fV0=\">Isaiah 9-12; 41-46<\/a>) synonymously parallels these &ldquo;son&rdquo; and &ldquo;servant&rdquo; aspects of Jehovah&rsquo;s vassal.<\/p><p>While the &ldquo;servant&rdquo; phase of a vassal&rsquo;s relationship to an emperor is conditional&mdash;depending on whether the vassal proves loyal to the emperor under all conditions&mdash;the &ldquo;son&rdquo; phase of their relationship is unconditional. In other words, after a vassal proves exceedingly loyal to the emperor by keeping the terms of his covenant, the emperor legally adopts him as his &ldquo;son.&rdquo; The covenant between them then becomes unconditional or &ldquo;everlasting.&rdquo; While chapters 41-46 reflect the conditional phase of Jehovah&rsquo;s vassal, chapters 9-12 reflect its unconditional phase&mdash;his formal investiture as king.<\/p><p><em>He will be called.<\/em> Historically, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODM3XQ==\">verses 6-7<\/a> serve as a Coronation Hymn for King Hezekiah, the prophesied Immanuel. The four Hebrew couplets that comprise the king&rsquo;s titulary&mdash;&ldquo;Wonderful Counselor, One Mighty in Valor, a Father for Ever, a Prince of Peace&rdquo; (<em>pele&rsquo; yo&lsquo;es &rsquo;el gibbor &rsquo;abi-&lsquo;ad sar-salom<\/em>)&mdash;reflect four phases in the life of Abraham as recorded in successive narratives of the Genesis account: (1) when he counsels with Lot; (2) when he delivers Lot; (3) when he begets Isaac, his heir; and (4) when he intercedes with Jehovah on behalf of the righteous in Sodom (<a class=\"ref\">Genesis 13-18<\/a>).<\/p><p>Although Handel&rsquo;s <em>Messiah<\/em> cites this prophecy of Isaiah in reference to Jesus&mdash;perhaps based in part on its mistranslation in the King James Version of the Bible&mdash;no scriptural writers do so because that would entirely remove it from its literary-scriptural context in the Book of Isaiah. As the exemplar of his people, Jehovah nevertheless embodies the divine attributes of counsel (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 25:1; 28:29<\/a>); valor (1:24; 49:26); fatherhood (45:10; 63:16); and kingship (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 33:22; 43:15<\/a>). Jehovah&rsquo;s servant and his associates, too, therefore, evidence these same attributes (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 11:2; 13:3; 22:21; 46:11; 49:23<\/a>).<\/p>",
