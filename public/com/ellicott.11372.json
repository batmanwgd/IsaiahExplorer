Mr. Cheyne quotes a striking parallel from the \u201cAnnals of Assurbanipal\u201d (Records of the Past, vii. 67), who, on receiving a defiant message from the King of Elam, went into the Temple of Ishtar, and, reminding the goddess of all he had done for her, besought her aid, and received an oracle from her as a vision of the night. <\/p> ",
