    "html": "<p> The expression <em> \u201cthat day\u201d<\/em> suggests the inquiry, What day is referred to? The prophet answers this question in the second strophe. <em> \u201cFor Jehovah of hosts hath a day over everything towering and lofty, and over everything exalted; and it becomes low.\u201d<\/em> <em> \u201cJehovah hath a day\u201d<\/em> (<em> yom <\/em> <em> layehovah <\/em> ), lit., there is to Jehovah a day, which already exists as a finished divine thought in that wisdom by which the course of history is guided (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4Mzc5XQ==\">Isaiah 37:26<\/a>, cf., <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MDY0XQ==\">Isaiah 22:11<\/a>), the secret of which He revealed to the prophets, who from the time of Obadiah and Joel downwards proclaimed that day with one uniform watchword. But when the time appointed for that day should arrive, it would pass out of the secret of eternity into the history of time - a day of world-wide judgment, which would pass, through the omnipotence with which Jehovah rules over the hither as well as lower spheres of the whole creation, upon all worldly glory, and it would be brought low (<em> shaphel <\/em> ). The current accentuation of  is wrong; correct MSS have \u05e2\u05dc with <em> m ercha <\/em> , \u05db\u05dc\u05be\u05e0\u05e9\u05c2\u05d0 with <em> tifcha <\/em> . The word <em> v'sha\u0302phel <\/em> (third pers. praet. with the root-vowel <em> ee<\/em> ) acquires the force of a future, although no grammatical future precedes it, from the future character of the day itself: \u201cand it will sink down\u201d (Ges. \u00a7126, 4).<\/p>",
