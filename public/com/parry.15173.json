As representatives of the Lord, we are assisting in the gathering of Israel through missionary work and through being a light upon a hill (<a class=\"ref\">Matt. 5:14-16<\/a>). We are \"the weak things of the world, those who are unlearned and despised\"\u2014those whom God has called upon \"to thrash the nations by the power of [his] Spirit\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 35:13<\/a>). <\/p> <p><i>ye shall be gathered one by one. Ye<\/i> refers to the children of Israel. In our day the elders of Israel are commanded to assist in the gathering of Israel: \"And ye are called to bring to pass the gathering of mine elect\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 29:7<\/a>). Members of the house of Israel do not usually join the Church in large groups; instead, they gather one by one as they hearken to the truth.<\/p> ",
