    "html": "<p align=\"center\" class=\"subtitle\"> XXII.<\/p> \n<p>(1) The burden of the valley of vision.\u2014The \u201cvalley of vision\u201d is Jerusalem, lying as it did ( <a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 21:13<\/a>) in a valley, as compared with the hills round about it ( <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 125:2<\/a>). If we think of the prophet\u2019s dwelling as being in the lower city, in the valley of Tyrop\u0153on, the epithet becomes still more appropriate. That valley would be to him in very deed a \u201cvalley of vision,\u201d where he saw things present and to come. Possibly the name became more characteristic from the impulse given to the prophetic dreams of all who claimed to be seers. The prophet looks out, and sees the people in a state of excitement, caused probably by the near approach of the Assyrian armies. They are \u201con the house-tops,\u201d the flat roofs of which were a customary place of concourse ( <a class=\"ref\">Judges 16:27; Nehemiah 8:16<\/a>), keeping their revels, as those do who meet the approach of danger with a reckless despair ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MDY2XQ==\">Isaiah 22:13<\/a>). By some commentators (Birks, Kay,) the \u201cvalley of vision\u201d has been identified with Samaria.<\/p> ",
