the people of the earth for their sins.<\/p>             <p>The earth will disclose the blood shed upon her;<\/p>             <p>\u2003she will conceal her slain no longer.<\/p>             <p>In that day,<\/p>             <p>the LORD will punish with his sword,<\/p>             <p>\u2003his fierce, great and powerful sword,<\/p>             <p>Leviathan the gliding serpent,<\/p>             <p>\u2003Leviathan the coiling serpent;<\/p>             <p>he will slay the monster of the sea.<\/p>         <\/blockquote>     <\/blockquote>     <h4>Original Meaning<\/h4>     <p>C<small>HAPTERS 26 AND<\/small> 27 (both are labeled as songs, 26:1; 27:2) seem to reflect on chapters 24 and 25. Chapter 26 focuses on the way in which the city perceives itself and its role in the world in the light of who God really is. Thus, it becomes an affirmation of trust and a call for God to demonstrate his sovereignty through his people. Chapter 27 concludes the section with a promise of return and restoration for Israel, making special use of the imagery of a vineyard.<\/p>     <p>\u2003As chapter 26 is now constructed, there are three units of thought: thanks for God\u2019s deliverance (vv. 1\u20136), dependence on God (vv. 7\u201319), and promises to the faithful (26:20\u201327:1). The second segment (26:7\u201319) seems to begin on a positive note of trust in God but then moves to a more negative confession of failure to have made a real difference in the world. It is difficult to ascertain whether there is a single line of thought or whether several related thoughts have been brought together.<\/p>     ",
