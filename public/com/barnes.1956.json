    "html": "<p><em>The Lord hath sworn by his right hand<\/em>&mdash;An oath was taken in various forms among the ancients. It was usually done by lifting up the hand toward beaten and appealing to God. As God could swear by no greater <a class=\"ref\">Hebrews 6:13<\/a> , he is represented as swearing by himself (see the notes at <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg1ODUiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 45:23<\/a> ). Here he is represented as swearing by his right hand and by his arm&mdash;the strong instrument by which he would accomplish his purposes to defend and save his people. The sense is, that he solemnly pledged the strength of his arm to deliver them, and restore them to their own land.<\/p><p><em>Surely I will no more give<\/em>&mdash;Margin, as in Hebrew, &lsquo;If I give.&rsquo; That is, I will not give.<\/p><p><em>Thy corn to be meat<\/em>&mdash;The word &lsquo;corn&rsquo; in the Scriptures means all kinds of grain&mdash;especially wheat, barley, etc. The word &lsquo;meat&rsquo; was formerly used to denote all kinds of food, and was not restricted as it is now usually to animal food. The meaning is, that they should not be subjected to the evils of foreign invasion and conquest.<\/p><p><em>And the sons of the stranger<\/em>&mdash;Foreigners, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg4MzIiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 60:10<\/a>.<\/p><p><em>Shall not drink thy wine<\/em>&mdash;The productions of your toil shall be safe, and you shall enjoy them yourselves. All this denotes a state of safety and prosperity, such as there would be if they were allowed to cultivate the soil without interruption, and were permitted to enjoy the fruit of their labors.<\/p>",
