Isaiah previously proclaimed, \"All flesh is grass.\" (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDI3XQ==\">Isaiah 40:6<\/a>.) In a latter-day revelation the Lord admonished his people not to fear those in positions of worldly power, \"for they are as grass, and all their glory as the flower thereof which soon falleth.\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 124:7<\/a>.) Place your confidence in the Lord, whose power is everlasting. The psalmist declared, \"In God I have put my trust; I will not fear what flesh can do unto me.\" (<a class=\"ref\">Psalm 56:4<\/a>.) Note that the expression \"son of man\" here is presented in lowercase letters referring to mortals. This should not be confused with \"Son of Man,\" who is Jesus Christ.<\/p>",
