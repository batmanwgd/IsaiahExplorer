    "html": "<p>The second is an opened understanding, following upon the ban of hardening. <i>\u201cAnd the eyes of the seeing no more are closed, and the ears of the hearing attend. And the heart of the hurried understands to know, and the tongue of stammerers speaks clear things with readiness.\u201d<\/i> It is not physical miracles that are predicted here, but a spiritual change. The present judgment of hardening will be repealed: this is what <a class=\"ref\"><\/a> affirms. The spiritual defects, from which many suffer who do not belong to the worst, will be healed: this is the statement in <a class=\"ref\"><\/a>. The form <span class=\"normal hebrew\">\ufb4a\u05e9\u05c1\u05e2\u05d9\u05e0\u05d4<\/span> is not the future of <span class=\"normal hebrew\">\u05e9\u05c1\u05e2\u05d4<\/span> here, as in <a class=\"ref\">; ; <\/a> (in the sense of, they will no longer stare about restlessly and without aim), but of <span class=\"normal hebrew\">\u05e9\u05c1\u05e2\u05d4<\/span> = <span class=\"normal hebrew\">\u05e9\u05c1\u05e2\u05e2<\/span>, a metaplastic future of the latter, in the sense of, to be smeared over to closed (see <a class=\"ref\">; <\/a>; cf., <i>(<span class=\"translit\">tach<\/span>) in <a class=\"ref\"><\/a>). On <i>(<span class=\"translit\">qa\u0302shabh<\/span>) (the <i>kal<\/i> of which is only met with here), see at <a class=\"ref\"><\/a>. The times succeeding the hardening, of which Isaiah is speaking here, are \u201cthe last times,\u201d as <a class=\"ref\"><\/a> clearly shows; though it does not therefore follow that the king mentioned in <a class=\"ref\"><\/a> (as in <a class=\"ref\"><\/a>.) is the Messiah Himself. In <a class=\"ref\"><\/a> the prophet merely affirms, that Israel as a national commonwealth will then be governed in a manner well pleasing to God; here he predicts that Israel as a national congregation will be delivered from the judgment of not seeing with seeing eyes, and not hearing with hearing ears, and that it will be delivered from defects of weakness also. The (<span class=\"translit\">nimha\u0302r\u0131\u0304m<\/span>) are those that fall headlong, the precipitate, hurrying, or rash; and the <span class=\"normal hebrew\">\u05e2\ufb3c\u05d2\u05d9\u05dd<\/span>, stammerers, are not scoffers (<a class=\"ref\">., <\/a>), as Knobel and Drechsler maintain, but such as are unable to think and speak with distinctness and certainty, more especially concerning the exalted things of God. The former would now have the gifts of discernment ((<span class=\"translit\">ya\u0302bh\u0131\u0304n<\/span>)), to perceive things in their true nature, and to distinguish under all circumstances that which is truly profitable ((<span class=\"translit\">la\u0302da\u201bath<\/span>)); the latter would be able to express themselves suitably, with refinement, clearness, and worthiness. (<span class=\"translit\">Tsacho\u0304th<\/span>) (old ed. (<span class=\"translit\">tsa\u0302cho\u0304th<\/span>)) signifies that which is light, transparent; not merely intelligible, but refined and elegant. <span class=\"normal hebrew\">\ufb4a\u05de\u05d4\u05e8<\/span> gives the adverbial idea to (<span class=\"translit\">ledabbe\u0304r<\/span>) (Ewald, \u00a7\u00a7285,a<\/i>).<br><\/i><\/p>",
