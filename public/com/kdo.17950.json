    "html": "<p> But the prophet, while addressing Asshur, does not overlook those sinners of his own nation who are deserving of punishment. The judgment upon Asshur is an alarming lesson, not only for the heathen, but for Israel also; for there is no respect of persons with Jehovah. <em> \u201cHear, ye distant ones, what I have accomplished; and perceive, ye near ones, my omnipotence! The sinners in Zion are afraid; trembling seizes the hypocrites: who of us can abide with devouring fire? who of us abide with everlasting burnings?\u201d<\/em> Even for the sinners in Jerusalem also there is no abiding in the presence of the Almighty and Just One, who has judged Asshur (the act of judgment is regarded by the prophet as having just occurred); they must either repent, or they cannot remain in His presence. Jehovah, so far as His wrath is concerned, is \u201ca consuming fire\u201d (<a class=\"ref\">Deuteronomy 4:24; Deuteronomy 9:3<\/a>); and the fiery force of His anger is \u201ceverlasting burnings\u201d (<em> mo\u0304kede\u0304 \u201b o\u0304la\u0302m <\/em> ), inasmuch as it consists of flames that are never extinguished, never burn themselves out. And this God had His fire and His furnace in Jerusalem (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MjYwXQ==\">Isaiah 31:9<\/a>), and had just shown what His fire could do, when once it burst forth. Therefore do the sinners inquire in their alarm, whilst confessing to one another (<em> la\u0302nu\u0304 <\/em> ; cf., <a class=\"ref\">Amos 9:1<\/a>) that none of them can endure it, <em> \u201cWho can dwell with devouring fire?\u201d<\/em> etc. (<em> gu\u0304r <\/em> with the acc. loci, as in <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 5:5<\/a>).<\/p>",
