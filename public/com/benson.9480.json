Few or none. The generality of them will never receive, nor believe in, such a Messiah as this. Thus this place is expounded by Christ himself, <a class=\"ref\">John 12:38 <\/a>,, and by St. Paul, <a class=\"ref\">Romans 10:16 <\/a>. And this premonition was highly necessary, both to caution the Jews that they should not stumble at this stone, and to instruct the Gentiles that they should not be surprised nor seduced with their example. <i>And to whom \u2014 <\/i>,Hebrew, <span class=\"hebrew_text\">,\u05e2\u05dc \u05de\u05d9 <\/span>,, <i>because, <\/i>,or, <i>in behalf of whom, <\/i>,namely, to deliver them from the guilt and dominion of their sins, and other spiritual enemies; <i>is the arm <\/i>\u2014That is, the power; <i>of the Lord revealed? <\/i>\u2014This is only revealed, or displayed, for the deliverance of those who, with a lively and divine faith; <i>believe the report: <\/i>,for the gospel is <i>the power of God unto salvation <\/i>,only <i>to him that believeth, <\/i>, <a class=\"ref\">Romans 1:16 <\/a>. <\/p>,",
