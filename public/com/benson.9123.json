Thou, who didst trample on, and destroy all the nations! <i>For thou hast said in thy heart \u2014 <\/i>,Which lay open to God\u2019s inspection; <i>I will ascend into heaven <\/i>\u2014I will advance myself above the state of weak and mortal men. <i>I will exalt my throne above the stars of God <\/i>\u2014Above all other kings and potentates; or, above the most eminent persons of God\u2019s church. <i>I will sit upon the mount of the congregation <\/i>\u2014I will establish my royal throne upon mount Zion, where the Jews meet together to worship God: <i>in the sides of the north <\/i>\u2014This is added as a more exact description of the place of the temple; it stood upon mount Moriah, which was northward from the hill of Zion, strictly so called. <i>I will be like the Most High <\/i>\u2014In the uncontrollableness of my power, and the universal extent of my dominion. By putting these and such like words into the mouths of the kings of Babylon, the prophet means to show their excessive pride, and the confidence which they entertained, that they should perpetually reign over the Jews. <\/p>,",
