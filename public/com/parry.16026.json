The Lord allowed the dispersion of Israel because of her wickedness; but he also promised her return (11:12; 43:5; 49:18). The gathering involves bringing souls unto the gospel covenant; it also involves a physical gathering of people to the land and city of Zion.<\/p> <p><i>they shall come, and see my glory.<\/i> When the righteous gather to Zion, they will behold the glory of the Lord. This statement may refer to standing in the presence of the Lord in the New Jerusalem, where \"the Lord shall be unto thee an everlasting light, and thy God thy glory\" (60:19; 60:3; 62:2; <a class=\"ref\">Rev. 21:23-24<\/a>). The righteous may also behold the glory of the Lord in his temple.<\/p> ",
