Applied to Lucifer, the statement suggests he will have no more part in a grave than an unfruitful shoot or blighted branch will be part of the tree from which it was cut off. On the other hand, as applied to the king of Babylon, the implication is that his body would remain unburied (which anciently was considered to be a great curse).<\/p>",
