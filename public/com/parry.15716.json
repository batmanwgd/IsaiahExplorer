Zion, that is, the people and city of the Lord, will be built physically and spiritually. In <a class=\"ref\">Ezek. 36:33<\/a> we learn that these events are millennial.<\/p> <p><i>wilderness like Eden\/desert like the garden of the Lord.<\/i> The land of Israel, which has long been as desolate as a desert, will be made into a wonderful, fruitful garden (30:23; 35:1-2; <a class=\"ref\">Ezek. 36:35<\/a>). This is representative of what will happen to the whole earth. As the tenth Article of Faith states, \"The earth will be renewed and receive its paradisiacal glory.\" Also, when we truly come to Zion, which means a union with one another and with our God, the wilderness and desert areas of our souls will be renewed and blessed.<\/p> <p><i>joy\/gladness\/thanksgiving\/melody.<\/i> These conditions contrast with the sorrow and misery suffered by the exiled Israelites and by those who have wandered in sin. When we return from any separation from the Lord or his promises, it is with much rejoicing (32:16-18; 35:10).<\/p> ",
