    "html": "<p><em>Many days and years<\/em>&mdash;Margin, &lsquo;Days above a year.&rsquo; This is a literal translation of the Hebrew. Septuagint, &lsquo;Make mention of a day of a year in sorrow, with hope.&rsquo; Targum, &lsquo;Days with years.&rsquo; Kimchi supposes it means &lsquo;two years.&rsquo; Grotius supposes it means &lsquo;within three years.&rsquo; Various other interpretations may be seen in Poole&rsquo;s Synopsis. Gesenius renders it, &lsquo;For a year&rsquo;s time,&rsquo; according to the common expression &lsquo;a year and a day,&rsquo; denoting a complete year, and supposes that it means a considerable time, a long period. The phrase literally means &lsquo;the days. upon (or beyond) a year,&rsquo; and may denote a long time; as the entire days in a year would denote a long period of suffering. Lowth renders it, not in accordance with the Hebrew, &lsquo;Years upon years.&rsquo; Noyes, &lsquo;One year more, and ye shall tremble.&rsquo; Perhaps this expresses the sense; and then it would denote not the length of time which they would suffer, but would indicate that the calamities would soon come upon them.<\/p><p><em>For the vintage shall fail<\/em>&mdash;A large part of the wealth and the luxury of the nation consisted in the vintage. When the vine failed, there would be, of course, great distress. The sense is, that in consequence of the invasion of the Assyrians, either the people would neglect to cultivate the lands, or they would fail to collect the harvest. This might occur either from the dread of the invasion, or because the Assyrian would destroy everything in his march.<\/p> ",
