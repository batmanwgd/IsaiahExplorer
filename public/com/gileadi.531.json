In the act of redeeming his people spiritually, he similarly evidences &ldquo;no distinguished appearance, that we should notice him, no [pleasing] aspect that we should find him attractive&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTg3MTQ=\">Isaiah 53:2<\/a>). Such modesty by the &ldquo;Savior God of Israel&rdquo; befits humanity&rsquo;s exemplar: &ldquo;Learn of me for I am meek and lowly of heart&rdquo; (<a class=\"ref\">Matthew 11:29<\/a>).<\/p>",
