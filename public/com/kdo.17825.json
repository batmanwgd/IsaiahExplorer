    "html": "<p> Asshur, as we already know from <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzk5OSI6N30=\">Isaiah 18:1-7<\/a>, is equally humbled; so that now the two great powers, which have hitherto only met as enemies, meet in the worship of Jehovah, which unites them together. <em> \u201cIn that day a road will run from Egypt to Asshur, and Asshur comes into Egypt, and Egypt to Asshur; and Egypt worships <\/em> (<em> Jehovah<\/em> )<em> with Asshur.\u201d<\/em> \u05d0\u05ea is not a sign of the accusative, for there can be no longer any idea of the subjection of Egypt to Asshur: on the contrary, it is a preposition indicating fellowship; and \u05e2\u05d1\u05d3\u05d5\u05bc is used in the sense of worship, as in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MDI2XQ==\">Isaiah 19:21<\/a>. Friendly intercourse is established between Egypt and Assyria by the fact that both nations are now converted to Jehovah. The road of communication runs through Canaan.<\/p>",
