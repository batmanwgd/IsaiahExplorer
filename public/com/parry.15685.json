This binding, which brings us to union and oneness, is the very essence of Zion. Binding might also refer to the ordinance of sealing. In various scriptures, the bride is depicted as being the Saints (61:10), the Church (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 109:73-74<\/a>), and the New Jerusalem (<a class=\"ref\">Rev. 21:2<\/a>). In this verse, the bride represents those who join Zion.<\/p> ",
