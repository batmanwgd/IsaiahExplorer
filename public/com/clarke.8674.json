The true reading seems to be <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d0\u05ea\u05d4 \u05e8\u05e2\u05d9 <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, roi attah<\/span>,; the word <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d0\u05ea\u05d4 <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, attah<\/span>, has probably been dropped out of the text. The same word is lost out of the text, <a class=\"ref\">Psalm 119:57<\/a>. It is supplied in the Septuagint by the word <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u03b5\u03b9<\/span>, thou art. <\/p>\n\n <p> <em>Saying to Jerusalem\u2014<\/em>, For <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d5\u05dc\u05d0\u05de\u05e8 <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, velemor<\/span>, the Septuagint and Vulgate read <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d4\u05d0\u05d5\u05de\u05e8 <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, haomer<\/span>,. <\/p>\n\n <p> <em>And to the temple\u2014 <\/em> <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d5\u05dc\u05d4\u05d9\u05db\u05dc <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, uleheychal<\/span>, as <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05dc\u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05e9\u05dc\u05dd <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, lirushalayim<\/span>, before; the preposition is necessary, and the Vulgate seems to read so. - Houbigant. <\/p>\n\n <p> <em>That saith of Cyrus, He is, or thou art, my shepherd - Saying to Jerusalem, \"Thou shalt be built;\" and to the Temple, \"Thy foundation shall be laid.\"\u2014<\/em>, There is a remarkable beauty and propriety in this verse. <\/p> <ol> <li>, Cyrus is called God's shepherd. Shepherd was an epithet which Cyrus took to himself; and what he gave to all good kings. <\/li> <\/ol> <li>, This Cyrus should say to the temple: \"Thy foundation shall be laid.\" Not - thou shalt be built. The fact is, only the foundation was laid in the days of Cyrus, the Ammonites having prevented the building; nor was it resumed till the second year of Darius, one of his successors. There is often a precision in the expressions of the prophets which is as honorable to truth, as it is unnoticed by careless readers.<\/li>,",
