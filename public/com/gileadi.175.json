For those who repent of transgression, who return to Zion in an exodus out of a world self-destructing, sorrow turns to joy: &ldquo;Let the ransomed of Jehovah return! Let them come singing to Zion, their heads crowned with everlasting joy; let them obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing flee away&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4Njg1XQ==\">Isaiah 51:11 <\/a>).
