He now intends to add Jerusalem to the number of vanquished cities and kingdoms, and to boast; that he has subdued the nation under the protection of Yahweh, as he had done the nations under the protection of idol-gods.<\/p><p><em>Have laid waste all, the nations<\/em>&mdash;Hebrew, as Margin, &lsquo;All the lands.&rsquo; But this is evidently an elliptical form of expression, meaning all the inhabitants or people of the lands. In <a class=\"ref\">2 Kings 19:17<\/a> , it is thus expressed. &lsquo;The kings of Assyria have destroyed the nations and their lands.&rsquo;<\/p> ",
