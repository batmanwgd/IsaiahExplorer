Once again the Nephite text clarifies the biblical text. The addition of the word \"not\" two times in verse 9 provides the intended meaning of Isaiah's statement.<\/p>     <table>         <tbody>             <tr>                 <td>5 O house of Jacob, come ye<u>,<\/u> and let us walk in the light of the Lord<u>.<\/u>                     <br>                     <br>6 Therefore thou hast forsaken thy people the house of Jacob, because they be replenished from the east, and <u>are<\/u> soothsayers like the Philistines, and they please themselves in the children of strangers.                     <br>                     <br>7 Their land also is full of silver and gold, neither is there any end of their treasures; their land is also full of horses, neither is there any end of their chariots<u>:<\/u>                     <br>                     <br>8 Their land <i>also is<\/i> full of idols; they worship the work of their own hands, that which their own fingers have made<u>:<\/u>                     <br>                     <br>9 And the mean man boweth down, and the great man humbleth himself<u>:<\/u> therefore forgive <u>them<\/u> not.                     <br>                 <\/td>                 <td>5 O house of Jacob, come ye<u>,<\/u> and let us walk in the light of the Lord<u>.<\/u>                     <br>                     <br>6 Therefore thou hast forsaken thy people the house of Jacob, because they be replenished from the east, and <u>are<\/u> soothsayers like the Philistines, and they please themselves in the children of strangers.                     <br>                     <br>7 Their land also is full of silver and gold, neither is there any end of their treasures; their land is also full of horses, neither is there any end of their chariots<u>.<\/u>                     <br>                     <br>8 Their land <i>is also<\/i> full of idols; they worship the work of their own hands, that which their own fingers have made<u>.<\/u>                     <br>                     <br>9 And the mean man boweth <u>not<\/u> down, and the great man humbleth himself <u>not,<\/u> therefore<u>,<\/u> forgive <u>him<\/u> not.                     <br>                 <\/td>             <\/tr>         <\/tbody>     <\/table>",
