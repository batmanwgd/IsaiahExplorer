Paralleled with it is the promise of Jehovah&rsquo;s pouring out his Spirit and blessing on his people&rsquo;s descendants, thus likening the lack of his Spirit to dry ground. In other words, once the Jacob\/Israel category renews its covenant relationship with Jehovah, his people&rsquo;s covenant curses reverse and his blessings flow. Comprising the two primary blessings of his covenant, land and offspring are here enhanced to a land Jehovah regenerates and offspring that he endows with his Spirit (cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg2NzYiOjJ9LFsxODgyMl1d\">Isaiah 51:2-3; 59:21<\/a>).<\/p> ",
