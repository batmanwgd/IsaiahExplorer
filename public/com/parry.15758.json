Luke records, \"The child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was upon him\" (<a class=\"ref\">Luke 2:40<\/a>). <\/p> <p><i>root.<\/i> The <i>root<\/i> here is Christ himself. Christ is the vine, or root, and we are the branches (<a class=\"ref\">John 15:5<\/a>). He came forth not in a fertile land but in dry ground, both temporally and spiritually.<\/p> <p><i>dry ground.<\/i> The spiritual barrenness of the Jewish apostasy. The <i>dry ground<\/i> is the opposite of streams of water, which usually denotes temporal happiness and prosperity. Streams of water also represent the spiritual life brought by the gospel.<\/p> <p><i>no form nor comeliness\/no beauty.<\/i> Scholars conjecture that this passage refers not to the Savior's physical appearance but to the fact that Jesus would not come in the glorious manner the Jews were expecting. President Joseph Fielding Smith interpreted these words to mean that Jesus would look like an ordinary man and thus the Jews would not recognize him as the Son of God. <\/p> ",
