    "html": "<p>The synonymous parallelism of &ldquo;Sheol&rdquo; and &ldquo;Death,&rdquo; and the pairing of these terms with &ldquo;the Pit,&rdquo; likens all three to a state not just of physical death but of non-ascent as signified by the verb &ldquo;go down.&rdquo; What praises and glorifies God is his people&rsquo;s experiencing spiritual rebirth and ascent in the land of the living after the pattern of King Hezekiah. Spiritual as well as physical &ldquo;fathers&rdquo;&mdash;proxy saviors under the terms of the Davidic Covenant (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MDc0LDE4NjU5XQ==\">Isaiah 22:21; 49:22<\/a>)&mdash;pass the knowledge of Jehovah&rsquo;s &ldquo;faithfulness&rdquo; or &ldquo;truth&rdquo; (<em>&rsquo;emet<\/em>) to their &ldquo;sons&rdquo;&mdash;their spiritual vassals&mdash;as did the prophet Isaiah to Hezekiah.<\/p><p>Exemplifying <em>faithfulness<\/em> is Jehovah, the God of Israel (cf. <a class=\"ref\">Revelation 19:11<\/a>), who at all times sustains and comforts those who wait for him and who trust in his deliverance (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxNzkwMywxODEyOF0seyIxODEzNCI6Mn0sWzE4MjM2LDE4NDUyLDE4NjYwLDE4ODkwXV0=\">Isaiah 12:2; 25:9; 26:3-4; 30:18; 40:31; 49:23; 64:4<\/a>). The antithesis of Israel&rsquo;s God as the source of eternal life and regeneration to his people (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDg2XQ==\">v 16; Isaiah 42:5<\/a>) is <em>Death<\/em>, as typified by the king of Assyria\/Babylon. Leaving his followers comfortless in their hour of need (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzk0OSI6M30=\">Isaiah 14:20-22<\/a>), the archtyrant ends up in the &ldquo;Pit of Dissolution&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3OTQ2XQ==\">v 17<\/a>), there to endure spiritual as well as physical death, or de-creation (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3OTQ0XQ==\">Isaiah 14:15<\/a>).<\/p>",
