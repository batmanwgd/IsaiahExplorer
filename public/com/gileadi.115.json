    "html": " <p>Ahaz&rsquo; disloyalty provides the context of Jehovah&rsquo;s response to Ahaz. Although Matthew applies Isaiah&rsquo;s prophecy of the son Immanuel to Jesus (<a class=\"ref\">Matthew 1:22-23<\/a>), that interpretation doesn&rsquo;t qualify as a personal &ldquo;sign&rdquo; or &ldquo;confirmation&rdquo; (<em>&rsquo;ot<\/em>) to Ahaz. As the name Immanuel (<em>&lsquo;immanu &rsquo;el <\/em>)&mdash;&ldquo;God Is with Us&rdquo;&mdash;appears three times (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3Nzk3LDE3ODE2LDE3ODE4XQ==\">Isaiah 7:14; 8:8, 10<\/a>), its full meaning is determined within its fuller context. That includes the king of Assyria\/Babylon&rsquo;s invasion of the land of Immanuel in the days of Immanuel (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzc5OSI6NX0=\">vv 16-20<\/a>), as happened a generation later in the days of King Hezekiah, Ahaz&rsquo; own son: <\/p> <p>&ldquo;My Lord will cause to come up over them the great and mighty waters of the River&mdash;the king of Assyria in all his glory. He will rise up over all his channels and overflow all his banks. He will sweep into Judea [like] a flood and, passing through, reach the very neck; his outspread wings will span the breadth of your land, O Immanuel.... You may take courage in one another, but shall be in fear; you may arm yourselves, but shall be terrorized. Though you hold consultations, they shall come to nought; though you make proposals, they shall not prove firm: God is with us!&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzgxNSI6NH0=\">Isaiah 8:7-10<\/a>). <\/p> <p> <em>Immanuel.<\/em>, Within the larger context of Isaiah&rsquo;s prophecy, moreover, the son Immanuel is one of three who represent three spiritual categories of people in Jehovah&rsquo;s Day of Judgment: (1) Immanuel&mdash;&ldquo;God Is with Us&rdquo;&mdash;an elect category whom Jehovah is <em>with<\/em>, for whose sake he delivers his people; (2) Shear-Jashub&mdash;&ldquo;A Remnant Shall Repent\/Return&rdquo;&mdash;those who &ldquo;repent&rdquo; (<em>swb<\/em>) of transgression and &ldquo;return&rdquo; (<em>swb<\/em>) in an end-time exodus to Zion; and (3) Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz&mdash;&ldquo;Hasten the Plunder, Hurry the Spoil&rdquo;&mdash;those whom the archtyrant destroys on account of their wickedness (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzgwOSI6NH0=\">Isaiah 8:1-4<\/a>). <\/p> <p> <em>The young woman with child.<\/em>, As the term Isaiah uses&mdash;&ldquo;young woman&rdquo; (<em>&lsquo;alma <\/em>)&mdash;isn&rsquo;t the Hebrew word for &ldquo;virgin&rdquo; (<em>betula <\/em>), and as the tense of the Hebrew verb &ldquo;to be with child&rdquo; or &ldquo;to be pregnant&rdquo; (<em>hara<\/em>) is present, not future, a &ldquo;sign&rdquo; or &ldquo;confirmation&rdquo; (<em>&rsquo;ot<\/em>) to Ahaz such as this would be most meaningful if the woman was known to him under the immediate circumstances&mdash;if she were present, for example, at the Laundry Plaza (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3Nzg2XQ==\">v 3<\/a>). The historical context of Isaiah&rsquo;s Immanuel prophecy, in other words, and its particular choice of terms, helps determine the full meaning of this verse. <\/p> <p> <em>Shall give birth to a son.<\/em>, While Jehovah&rsquo;s sign to Ahaz doesn&rsquo;t exclude Matthew&rsquo;s interpretation&mdash;that in this instance Isaiah was prophesying of Jesus&mdash;that interpretation doesn&rsquo;t accord with the prophecy&rsquo;s primary intent in Isaiah&rsquo;s prophecy as a whole. Indeed, it is in the nature of Hebrew prophecy to contain several levels of meaning. On the other hand, Hezekiah&mdash;Ahaz&rsquo; son&mdash;in all respects qualifies as the prophesied Immanuel, whose people Israel&rsquo;s God is <em>with<\/em>, when he delivers them from the Assyrian army that takes up a position at the very same Laundry Plaza (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxNzc4Nl0seyIxODMzMiI6Mn0seyIxODM4NiI6NH1d\">v 3; Isaiah 36:1-2; 37:33-36<\/a>). <\/p>",
