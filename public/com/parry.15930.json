Before her deliverance and redemption, she was seen as forsaken, abandoned by her husband, and desolate\u2014deserted, barren, and without hope. But all that will be forgotten in her glorious future (54:1, 6-8; 60:14-15). Then she will be known as <i>Hephzi-bah<\/i> (\"My delight is in her,\" or \"Delightful\") and <i>Beulah<\/i> (\"married wife\" or \"Union\").<\/p> <p><i>thy land shall be married.<\/i> The earth was divided into continents in the days of Peleg (<a class=\"ref\">Gen. 10:25<\/a>), and it will be brought back to its original state in the last days (in Hebrew, the name <i>Peleg<\/i> means \"divided\"). The marriage of the land is symbolic, first, of the union found in Zion; and second, of the reunion of the souls of the righteous with their God, through the atonement of Christ. This remarkable event is prophesied to occur in conjunction with the return of Israel's lost tribes from the north countries (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 133:23-34; 3 Ne. 21:23-26<\/a>). <\/p> ",
