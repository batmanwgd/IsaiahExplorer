Justice and righteousness alone beget true and lasting peace: &ldquo;The effect of justice shall be peace, and the result of righteousness an assured calm forever&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4Mjc3XQ==\">Isaiah 32:17<\/a>). By making peaceable agreements, then deliberately breaking them, the archtyrant takes advantage of gullible enemies (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MjgxXQ==\">v 1<\/a>). In his treacherous attack on Jehovah&rsquo;s people, he devastates their lands from the mountains of Lebanon to the great Sharon Plain, to the ranges of Bashan and Carmel. <\/p> ",
