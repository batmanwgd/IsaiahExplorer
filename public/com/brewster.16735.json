    "html": "<p>In his inspired revision or translation of the Bible (JST), the Prophet Joseph Smith placed verse 1 of this chapter as the last verse of the previous chapter, where it more logically fits. Chapter 3 of Isaiah is filled with woe and destruction, whereas chapter 4 focuses on hope and holiness in the millennial day.<\/p>     <p>Isaiah portrays the beauty of the Lord's Zion. He emphasizes that the future inhabitants of both Zion (the New Jerusalem) and (the old) Jerusalem will be holy. Just as in ancient times, the Lord's canopy will cover His people. His presence will be evident in their homes as well as their places of worship.<\/p>",
