    "html": " <i>report. <\/i>This term likely refers to the report of the prophets, or the revelation they have reported to the people about the life and mission of Christ. John observed that many did not believe the report about the works and mission of Christ: \"Though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him: That the saying of Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed? Therefore they could not believe, because that Esaias said again, He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them. These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spake of him\" (<a class=\"ref\">John 12:37-41; Rom. 10:13-17<\/a>). <\/p> <p><i>arm of the Lord revealed.<\/i> In <a class=\"ref\">Deut. 7:18-19<\/a>, the acts of the Lord's arm (which represents his power) were seen, but the arm itself remained unseen. In the birth and ministry of Christ, the Lord's arm is visibly revealed.<\/p> ",
