    "html": "<p>In the course of serving as a proxy savior of Jehovah&rsquo;s people&mdash;&ldquo;bearing their iniquities&rdquo; under the terms of the Davidic Covenant (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 53:11<\/a>)&mdash;Jehovah&rsquo;s &ldquo;servant&rdquo; or vassal suffers horrific physical &ldquo;marring beyond human likeness&rdquo; at the hands of enemies as an intrinsic part of his descent phase. Just as many people are appalled at his plight, however, so he astounds them when Jehovah heals him (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 57:18-19<\/a>). In his ascent phase that follows&mdash;when Jehovah empowers him over his enemies (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 49:8; 51:9<\/a>)&mdash;he becomes &ldquo;highly exalted&rdquo; and &ldquo;exceedingly eminent&rdquo; (cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 11:10; 55:5<\/a>).<\/p><p>From the similar exalted language that describes Jehovah (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 6:1; 57:15<\/a>), we learn that as his people ascend spiritually they may assume not only his righteous attributes but also inherit greater degrees of glory (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODY5OCwxODExMiwxODYwMF0seyIxODg1NyI6Mn1d\">v 1; Isaiah 24:16; 46:13; 62:2-3<\/a>). Like Jehovah&rsquo;s servant, in other words, all who covenant with Jehovah may ascend&shy; and attain higher spiritual categories (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 4:2; 11:2-5, 10; 55:3-5<\/a>)&mdash;from Jacob\/Israel to Zion\/Jerusalem to sons\/servants to seraphs\/saviors. In the millennial age of peace that ensues, they may likewise inherit thrones of glory (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODY5OV0seyIxNzgzNiI6Mn0seyIxODA3NiI6Mn0sWzE4MjYxLDE4ODU3XV0=\">v 2; Isaiah 9:6-7; 22:23-24; 32:1; 62:2<\/a>).<\/p><p>Among those who ascend are the spiritual kings of the Gentiles who hush up when Jehovah&rsquo;s servant ministers to them: &ldquo;To you who know me, who are of my fold, I have reported what I heard from Jehovah of Hosts&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 21:10<\/a>). What hitherto &ldquo;was not told them,&rdquo; and which they &ldquo;had not heard,&rdquo; the servant thus teaches them, empowering them to perform their savior roles (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 49:22-23; 50:4; 61:1-3, 6<\/a>). As the servant resembles Solomon&mdash;who was &ldquo;astute&rdquo; or &ldquo;sapient&rdquo; (<em>yaskil<\/em>)&mdash;so these kings and their queens resemble the monarchs who came to hear Solomon (<a class=\"ref\">1 Kings 4:29-34<\/a>; cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 49:7<\/a>).<\/p>",
