If God is to keep his promises, two things must happen: Babylon must fall (ch. 47), and the exiled people must listen to God and believe him so that when Babylon does fall and they have the opportunity to return home, they will dare to act on the opportunity (ch. 48).<\/p>         <p>\u2003Most commentators consider chapter 47 to be a self-contained poem constructed on the model of the oracles against the nations. With relentless vigor it declares the fall of proud Babylon. It makes its point in three stanzas: Babylon\u2019s humiliation (vv. 1\u20134), Babylon\u2019s false pride (vv. 5\u201311), and Babylon\u2019s helplessness (vv. 12\u201317). The central issue in the poem is the humiliation of Babylon and her inability to do anything about it. Ultimately, then, the issue is pride, the same issue dealt with in regard to the nations in the earlier part of the book. Can any of the nations of earth compare to Israel\u2019s Holy One? Once again, the answer is a resounding no.<\/p>         ",
