    "html": " <p> <em>Say ye to the righteous <\/em>&mdash;The meaning of this verse and the following is sufficiently plain, though expositors have given some variety of interpretation. They declare a great principle of the divine administration similar to what is stated in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzY3NCI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 1:19-20<\/a>. Lowth reads it, &lsquo;Pronounce ye a blessing on the just; verily good (shall be to him).&rsquo; <\/p> <p> <em>That it shall be well... <\/em>&mdash;The word rendered &lsquo;well,&rsquo; means &lsquo;good.&rsquo; The sense evidently is, that in the divine administration it shall be well to be righteous. The Septuagint has rendered this in a remarkable manner, connecting it with the previous verse: &lsquo;Wo unto their soul, for they take evil counsel among themselves, saying, &lsquo;Let us bind the righteous, for he is troublesome unto us:&rsquo; therefore, they shall eat the fruit of their doings.&rsquo; <\/p> <p> <em>They shall eat... <\/em>&mdash;That is, they shall receive the appropriate &ldquo;reward&rdquo; of their works, and that reward shall be happiness. As a farmer who sows his field and cultivates his farm, eats the fruit of his labor, so shall it be with the righteous. A similar expression is found in <a class=\"ref\">Proverbs 1:31<\/a>: <\/p> <p>Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, <\/p> <p>And be filled with their own devices. <\/p> <p>Also <a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 6:19<\/a>: &lsquo;I will bring evil upon this people, even the fruit of their thought;&rsquo; compare <a class=\"ref\">Galatians 6:8<\/a>. <\/p> ",
