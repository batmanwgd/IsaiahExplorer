    "html": " <p>Here Isaiah continues the theme that Israel (both the Northern and Southern Kingdoms) must face judgments before Jacob&rsquo;s final restoration. Isaiah, chapter 28, speaks of the rebellion of the ten tribes inhabiting northern Israel, of which Ephraim was the acknowledged leader. &ldquo;The Lord hath a mighty and strong&rdquo; nation, Assyria, waiting like &ldquo;a flood of mighty waters&rdquo; to humble Israel by casting her &ldquo;down to the earth&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTY3XQ==\">v. 2<\/a>). Then, like a flower that fades in the hot sun (see <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTY5XQ==\">v. 4<\/a>), or a drunken man who staggers under wine (see <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTcyXQ==\">v. 7<\/a>), Israel will be removed from her promised land. In 724 <small> B.C.<\/small>, Shalmaneser, king of Assyria, besieged Samaria. The siege ended after three years with Sargon II finally carrying the ten tribes away into captivity. <\/p> <p class=\"cite\">, LDS Church Educational System Old Testament Student Manual, 1 Kings&ndash;Malachi, Religion 302, Chapter 15, Item 11 <\/p>",
