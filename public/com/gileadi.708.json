Jehovah has spoken: I have reared sons, brought them up, but they have revolted against me&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NjU3XQ==\">Isaiah 1:2<\/a>); &ldquo;They are a rebellious people, sons who break faith, children unwilling to obey the law of Jehovah&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MjI3XQ==\">Isaiah 30:9<\/a>). By their rebellions they not only &ldquo;grieve his holy Spirit,&rdquo; they make themselves Jehovah&rsquo;s enemies, hastening his Day of Judgment: &ldquo;Woe to them! I will relieve me of my adversaries, avenge me of my enemies&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3Njc5XQ==\">Isaiah 1:24<\/a>). <\/p> ",
