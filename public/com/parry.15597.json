    "html": " <p>This passage illustrates some of the roles and attributes of God: He is the Creator (\"created the heavens;&hellip;formed the earth\"), the Revealer (\"I have not spoken in secret\"), and the \"Savior\" (45:18, 19, 21). He is \"just\" (45:21) and gives us power to do righteousness (\"in the Lord have I righteousness and strength\"; 45:24). He is a God of truth and equity (\"I&hellip;speak righteousness\"; 45:19). He is the source of true prophecy, as contrasted with false gods (\"Who hath declared this from ancient time?&hellip;have not I the Lord?\"; 45:21). He is the only true God (\"no God else beside me\"; 45:21). He is the God of the whole earth (\"look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth\"; 45:22). Eventually, all must acknowledge him (\"every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear\"; 45:23). In him, the faithful will be \"justified\" and have cause to \"glory\" (45:25). All this stands in contrast to the gods of the heathen, which \"cannot save\" (45:20). It also stands in contrast to the things of our day that we embrace in place of the one true God.<\/p> <blockquote> For thus saith the <i>Lord<\/i> that <u>created the heavens<\/u>;     <br><i>God<\/i> himself that <u>formed the earth<\/u>     <br>and <u>made it<\/u>;     <br><i>he<\/i> hath <u>established it<\/u>,     <br><i>he<\/i> <u>created it<\/u> not in vain,     <br><i>he<\/i> <u>formed it<\/u> to be inhabited: I am the Lord; and there is none else. (45:18)     <br>I have<i> not spoken<\/i> in <u>secret<\/u>,     <br>in a <u>dark place<\/u> of the earth:<i> I said not <\/i>unto the seed of Jacob,     <br>Seek ye me in vain:     <br><i>I the Lord<\/i> <u>speak righteousness<\/u>,     <br><i>I <\/i> <u>declare<\/u> things that are <i>right.<\/i> (45:19)     <br><i>Assemble<\/i> yourselves and <u>come<\/u>;     <br><i>draw near together,<\/i> ye that are <u>escaped<\/u> of the nations:     <br>they have no knowledge that<i> set up<\/i> the wood of their <u>graven image<\/u>,     <br>and <i>pray<\/i> unto a <u>god<\/u> that cannot save. (45:20)     <br>Tell ye, and bring them near; yea, let them take counsel together:     <br>who <i>hath declared<\/i> this from <u>ancient time<\/u>?     <br>who<i> hath told<\/i> it from <u>that time<\/u>?     <br>have not <i>I the Lord?<\/i> and there is <u>no God else beside me<\/u><i>;<\/i>     <br><i>a just God and a Saviour;<\/i> there is <u>none beside me<\/u><i>.<\/i> (45:21)     <br>Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth:     <br>for <i>I am God,<\/i> and <u>there is none else<\/u>. (45:22)     <br>I have <i>sworn<\/i> by <u>myself<\/u>,     <br>the <i>word is gone out<\/i> of <u>my mouth<\/u> in righteousness, and shall not return,     <br>That unto me every <i>knee<\/i> shall <u>bow<\/u>,     <br>every <i>tongue<\/i> shall <u>swear<\/u>. (45:23)     <br>Surely, shall one say, in the Lord have I righteousness and strength:     <br>even to him shall men come;     <br>and <i>all that are incensed<\/i> against him <u>shall be ashamed<\/u>. (45:24)     <br>In the Lord shall <i>all the seed of Israel<\/i> be justified, and <u>shall glory<\/u>. (45:25)<\/blockquote> ",
