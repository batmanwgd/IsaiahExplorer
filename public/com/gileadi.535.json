    "html": "<p>By decreeing that to him &ldquo;every knee shall bow and every tongue swear [allegiance],&rdquo; Jehovah asserts his role as Savior of all humanity&mdash;of &ldquo;the ends of the earth&rdquo;&mdash;in the pattern of ancient Near Eastern emperor-vassal covenants. As under the collective Sinai Covenant, a people who demonstrate allegiance to the emperor bind him to deliver them from a mortal threat. Similarly, under the individual Davidic Covenant those who demonstrate allegiance to a loyal vassal of an emperor bind him to deliver them and his vassal. Those who fail to demonstrate such allegiance, the emperor isn&rsquo;t required to deliver.<\/p><p>Transposed into Isaiah&rsquo;s end-time scenario, that means Jehovah will ultimately save spiritually and temporally all who covenant to be his people and keep the terms of his covenants. An alternative savior to Jehovah may demand their allegiance, even on pain of death, but he can&rsquo;t save them. Only through <em>righteousness<\/em>&mdash;Jehovah&rsquo;s servant who personifies and mediates his <em>covenant<\/em> (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3sic2luZ2xlcyI6WzE4NDU0LDE4NDg3LDE4NjQ1XX0seyIxODc0NCI6Mn1d\">Isaiah 41:2; 42:6; 49:8; 55:3-4<\/a>)&mdash;may they gain deliverance. Although Jehovah&rsquo;s <em>mouth<\/em>&mdash;his servant (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3sic2luZ2xlcyI6WzE4NjM5LDE4NjkwXX0seyIxODg1NiI6Mn1d\">Isaiah 49:2; 51:16; 62:1-2<\/a>)&mdash;declares the only possible way they may be saved, Jehovah forces no one&rsquo;s allegiance.<\/p>",
