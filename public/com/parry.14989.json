The ensign represents the gospel of Jesus Christ (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 45:9; 105:39<\/a>) and the light that accompanies it (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 115:4-5<\/a>). The ensign, regularly mentioned in Isaiah (5:26; 11:10-12; 18:3; 30:17; 31:9; 49:22), was raised \"here in America, and the Lord calls upon all the world to take notice when this ensign is lifted upon the mountains.\" <\/p> <p><i>when he bloweth a trumpet.<\/i> The trumpet, with the ensign mentioned above, beckons the world's inhabitants to gather to Zion and its temples (27:13; <a class=\"ref\">Matt. 24:31<\/a>). Every missionary of our dispensation is instructed that \"at all times, and in all places, he shall open his mouth and declare my gospel as with the voice of a trump\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 24:12<\/a>) so the earth's inhabitants will hear the gospel's message. Thus the Lord's trumpet is the voice of his missionaries.<\/p> ",
