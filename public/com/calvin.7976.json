    "html": "<p><i>And I will tread down the peoples. <\/i>From the preceding statement he draws the conclusion, that God\u2019s wrath is sufficiently powerful to destroy the wicked, without calling for the assistance of others; and he does so in order that the Jews may not be deterred from cherishing favorable hopes by the strength that is arrayed against them. <\/p>\n<p><i>And will make them drunk. <\/i>The expression, \u201cmake drunk,\u201d must here be taken in a different sense from what it formerly had in some passages. We have seen that sometimes we are made drunk, when God strikes us with fury or madness, (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTgyMDM=\">Isaiah 29:9<\/a>,) or with a spirit of giddiness, (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTgwMTk=\">Isaiah 19:14<\/a>,) or, in a word, \u201cgives us up to a reprobate mind.\u201d (<a class=\"ref\">Romans 1:28<\/a>.) But here it means nothing else than \u201cto fill,\u201d and to strike even to satiety, or, as we commonly say, (<i>tout leur saoul <\/i>,) \u201cto their heart\u2019s content;\u201d a metaphor which the prophets frequently employ. <\/p>\n<p><i>And will cast down their strength to the earth<\/i>. That is, though they think that they are invincible, yet I will cast down and destroy them. The meaning may be thus summed up. \u201cThe Jews, when they are afflicted, must not call in question their salvation, as if God hated them, and must not be amazed at the chastisements which they endure, as if they happened by chance; for other nations, by whom they are now oppressed, shall be punished, there shall be a revolution of affairs, and they shall not escape who chant a triumph before the time. He produces as an example the Edomites, because they were nearer and better known than others, and were also the most injurious. <\/p>",
