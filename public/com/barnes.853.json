    "html": " <p> <em>Wo unto them that call evil good... <\/em>&mdash;This is the fourth class of sins denounced. The sin which is reprobated here is that of &ldquo;perverting and confounding&rdquo; things, especially the distinctions of morality and religion. They prefer erroneous and fake doctrines to the true; they prefer an evil to an upright course of conduct. The Chaldee renders this, &lsquo;Wo to those who say to the impious, who are prospered in this age, You are good; and who say to the meek, Ye are impious.&rsquo; Jarchi thinks that the prophet here refers to those who worship idols, but he evidently has a more general reference to those who confound all the distinctions of right and wrong, and who prefer the wrong. <\/p> <p> <em>That put darkness for light <\/em>&mdash;&ldquo;Darkness,&rdquo; in the Scriptures, is the emblem of ignorance, error, false doctrine, crime. Light denotes truth, knowledge, piety. This clause, therefore, expresses in a figurative, but more emphatic manner, what was said in the previous member of the verse. <\/p> <p> <em>That put bitter <\/em>&mdash;&ldquo;Bitter and bitterness&rdquo; are often used to denote &ldquo;sin;&rdquo; see the note at <a class=\"ref\">Acts 8:23<\/a>; also <a class=\"ref\">Romans 3:14; Ephesians 4:31; Hebrews 12:15; Jeremiah 2:19; Jeremiah 4:18<\/a>. The meaning here does not differ from that expressed in the other parts of the verse, except that there is &ldquo;implied&rdquo; the additional idea that sin &ldquo;is&rdquo; bitter; and that virtue, or holiness, is sweet: that is, that the one is attended with painful consequences, and the other with pleasure. <\/p> ",
