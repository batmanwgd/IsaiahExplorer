    "html": "<p>The &ldquo;way of perfection&rdquo; is Jehovah&rsquo;s way: &ldquo;I Jehovah your God instruct you to your good, guiding you in the way you should go&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NjMyXQ==\">Isaiah 48:17<\/a>); &ldquo;The path of the righteous is straight; you pave an undeviating course for the upright&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTM4XQ==\">Isaiah 26:7<\/a>). Jehovah&rsquo;s &ldquo;way&rdquo; leads into his presence and facilitates his coming to reign on the earth: &ldquo;Prepare the way; remove the obstacles from the path of my people!&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzgwXQ==\">Isaiah 57:14<\/a>; cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDI0LDE4ODY1XQ==\">40:3; 62:10<\/a>). Like the &ldquo;insensible shepherds&rdquo; of Jehovah&rsquo;s people, however, the wicked are &ldquo;all diverted to their own way, every one after his own advantage&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzY1XQ==\">Isaiah 56:11<\/a>; cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4OTAwXQ==\">65:2<\/a>).<\/p><p>The &ldquo;crooked paths&rdquo; the wicked make for themselves lead into realms of darkness and destruction (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODgxMCI6Mn0=\">vv 9-10<\/a>): &ldquo;They have no desire to walk in his ways or obey his law. So in the heat of his anger he pours out on them the violence of war, till it envelopes them in flames&mdash;yet they remain unaware&mdash;till it sets them on fire; yet they take it not to heart&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODUwNSI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 42:24-25<\/a>; cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODE0MSI6Mn0=\">26:10-11<\/a>). Their lack of &ldquo;integrity&rdquo; or &ldquo;justice&rdquo; (<em>mispat<\/em>) hastens Jehovah&rsquo;s Day of Judgment (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg4MTYiOjV9LHsiMTc3NjMiOjJ9LHsiMTc4NTIiOjN9XQ==\">vv 15-19; Isaiah 5:23-24; 10:1-3<\/a>). Those who &ldquo;tread&rdquo; or &ldquo;march&rdquo; (<em>dorek<\/em>) their own way can never enjoy peace (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODYzN10seyIxODc4NiI6Mn1d\">Isaiah 48:22; 57:20-21<\/a>).<\/p>",
