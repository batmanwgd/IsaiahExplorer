    "html": "<p> (19) Thy dead men shall live.\u2014Better, Thy dead shall live; my corpses shall rise. The words, though they imply a belief more or less distinct in a resurrection, are primarily like the vision of dry bones in<a class=\"ref\">Ezekiel 37:1-14<\/a> , and like St. Paul\u2019s \u201clife from the dead\u201d in<a class=\"ref\">Romans 11:15<\/a> (comp. also<a class=\"ref\">Hosea 6:2<\/a>), used of national and spiritual resurrection.<\/p> \n<p>For thy dew is as the dew of herbs.\u2014The rendering is a tenable one, and expresses the thought that as the dew that falls upon the parched and withered plant quickens it to a fresh life, so should the dew of Jehovah\u2019s grace (comp.<a class=\"ref\">2 Samuel 23:4<\/a>) revive the dying energies of His people. Most interpreters, however, render the words the dew of lights (plural expressing completeness), the dew which is born of the womb of the morning (<a class=\"ref\">Psalms 110:3<\/a>). This, coming as it does from the \u201cFather of Lights\u201d (so the LXX., \u201cThe dew that is from Thee shall be healing for them\u201d), shall have power to make the earth cast forth even the shadowy forms of the dead. The verb for \u201ccast forth\u201d is another form of that used in<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTQ5XQ==\">Isaiah 26:18<\/a> of childbirth, and is, in this interpretation, used in the same sense.<\/p> ",
