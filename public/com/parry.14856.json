Righteous individuals should imitate Christ: \"every man should take <i>righteousness<\/i> in his hands and <i>faithfulness<\/i> upon his <i>loins,<\/i> and lift a warning voice unto the inhabitants of the earth; and declare both by word and by flight that desolation shall come upon the wicked\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 63:37<\/a>; emphasis added; <a class=\"ref\">Eph. 6:14<\/a>). The Lord girds his loins with righteousness as he prepares to do his important work. The loins symbolize the creative powers (<a class=\"ref\">Gen. 35:11; 1 Kgs. 8:19<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\">Acts 2:30<\/a>). These items of clothing, the girdle of the loins and the sash around the waist, are also suggestive of temple ordinances.<\/p> ",
