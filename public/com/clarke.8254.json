And although the context speaks explicitly concerning Nebuchadnezzar, yet this has been, I know not why, applied to the chief of the fallen angels, who is most incongruously denominated Lucifer, (the bringer of light!) an epithet as common to him as those of Satan and Devil. That the Holy Spirit by his prophets should call this arch-enemy of God and man the light-bringer, would be strange indeed. But the truth is, the text speaks nothing at all concerning Satan nor his fall, nor the occasion of that fall, which many divines have with great confidence deduced from this text. O how necessary it is to understand the literal meaning of Scripture, that preposterous comments may be prevented! Besides, I doubt much whether our translation be correct. <span class=\"greek-hebrew\"> \u05d4\u05d9\u05dc\u05dc<\/span><span class=\"translit\"> heilel<\/span> , which we translate Lucifer, comes from<span class=\"greek-hebrew\"> \u05d9\u05dc\u05dc<\/span><span class=\"translit\"> yalal<\/span> , yell, howl, or shriek, and should be translated, \"Howl, son of the morning;\" and so the Syriac has understood it; and for this meaning Michaelis contends: see his reasons in Parkhurst, under<span class=\"greek-hebrew\"> \u05d4\u05dc\u05dc<\/span><span class=\"translit\"> halal<\/span> .<\/p> ",
