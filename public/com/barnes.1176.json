    "html": "<p><em>As at the report concerning Egypt<\/em>&mdash;According to our translation, this verse would seem to mean that the Sidonians and other nations had been pained or grieved at the report of the calamities that had come upon Egypt, and that they would be similarly affected at the report concerning Tyre. In accordance with this, some (as Jarchi) have understood it of the plagues of Egypt, and suppose that the prophet means to say, that as the nations were astonished at that, so they would be at the report of the calamities that would come upon Tyre. Others refer it to the calamities that. would come upon Egypt referred to in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgwMDYiOjI1fV0=\">Isaiah 19<\/a> , and suppose that the prophet means to say, that as the nations would be amazed at the report of these calamities, so they would be at the report of the overthrow of Tyre. So Vitringa. But the sense of the Hebrew may be expressed thus: &lsquo;As the report, or tidings of the destruction of Tyre shall reach Egypt, they shall be pained at the tidings respecting Tyre.&rsquo; So Lowth, Noyes, Rosenmuller, Grotius, Calvin. They would be grieved, either<\/p><p>(1) because the destruction of Tyre would injure the commerce of Egypt; or<\/p><p>(2) because the Egyptians might fear that the army of Nebuchadnezzar would come upon them, and that they would share the fate of Tyre.<\/p><p><em>Sorely pained<\/em>&mdash;The word used here (\u05d9\u05d7\u05d9\u05dc\u05d5\u05bc ya\u0302ch\u0131\u0302ylu\u0302) is commonly applied to the severe pain of parturition.<\/p>",
