    "html": "<p><em>Behold, they are all vanity<\/em>&mdash;They are unable to predict future events; they are unable to defend their friends, or to injure their enemies. This is the conclusion of the trial or debate (notes, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 41:1<\/a> ), and that conclusion is, that they were utterly destitute of strength, and that they were entirely unworthy of confidence and regard.<\/p><p><em>Their molten images<\/em>&mdash;(See the note at <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 40:19<\/a>).<\/p><p><em>Are wind<\/em>&mdash;Have no solidity or power. The doctrine of the whole chapter is, that confidence should be reposed in God, and in him alone. He is the friend of his people, and he is able to protect them. He will deliver them from the hand of all their enemies; and he will be always their God, protector, and guide. The idols of the pagan have no power; and it is folly, as well as sin, to trust in them, or to suppose that they can aid their friend.<\/p><p>It may be added, also, that it is equally vain to trust in any being for salvation but God. He only is able to protect and defend us; and it is a source of unspeakable consolation now, as it was in times past, that he is the friend of his people; and that, in times of deepest darkness and distress, he can raise up deliverers, as he did Cyrus, and will in his own way and time rescue his people from all their calamities.<\/p>",
