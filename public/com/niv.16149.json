In place of the peace and quiet that the tyrant\u2019s death has brought to the earth, the underworld is in an uproar. All the kings have been sitting on their thrones. Now they rise, stretching their necks to get a glimpse of this newcomer. He is the one who sneeringly sent them on their way to this grim and dusty place, and now he has come to join them! In the end he is no stronger than they were. He could no more prevent his death than they could theirs.<\/p>     <p>\u2003Verse 11 is a masterpiece of sarcasm and irony. We see a funeral celebration where a gorgeously bedecked bier is carried past with \u201cpomp\u201d and with lovely music played by \u201charps\u201d and other instruments. \u201cBeautiful,\u201d we say. Then the picture suddenly changes. All is deathly still, and we see that the beautiful bier and its coverings are nothing but a writhing mass of \u201cmaggots.\u201d Human pretension is no match for the grim reality of death and decay.<\/p>     ",
