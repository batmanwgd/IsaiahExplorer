    "html": " <i>Ahaz.<\/i> Ahaz was a king of Judah (735-715 b.c.), the son of Jotham and father of Hezekiah. Ahaz chose to ignore Isaiah's prophetic words and instead followed a path of evil, which included making \"molten images for Baalim,\" offering sacrifices and burning \"incense in the high places,\" and sacrificing his children to false deities (2 Chr. 28:2-4, 23-25; <a class=\"ref\">2 Kgs. 16:2-4,  10-16<\/a>). <\/p> <p><i>Rezin.<\/i> This king of Syria (<a class=\"ref\">2 Kgs. 15:37<\/a>), together with Pekah, waged an anti- Assyrian campaign. Eventually, Rezin was killed during a battle against Assyria (<a class=\"ref\">2 Kgs. 16:7-9<\/a>). <\/p> <p><i>Pekah.<\/i> Pekah, who was the son of Remaliah, \"conspired against\" Pekahiah (king of Israel and son of Menahem), assassinated him, and became Israel's eighteenth king. Pekah's reign lasted approximately five years (737-732 b.c.; <a class=\"ref\">2 Kgs. 15:22-26<\/a>). Pekah, who with Rezin battled against Ahaz king of Judah, was eventually murdered by Hosea (not to be confused with the prophet Hosea), who succeeded him on the throne (<a class=\"ref\">2 Kgs. 15:30<\/a>). It was during King Hosea's reign that the northern tribes of Israel (the ten tribes) were captured and deported by Assyria.<\/p> ",
