And so shall it be with Ephraim\u2019s glory, which his enemies shall covet and spoil, and devour greedily. \u201cThe image,\u201d says Bishop Lowth, \u201cexpresses, in the strongest manner, the great ease with which the Assyrians should take the city and the whole kingdom, and the avidity with which they should seize the rich prey without resistance.\u201d <\/p> ",
