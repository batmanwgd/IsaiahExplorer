As king he will protect his people, both physically and spiritually, from their enemies and will bring relief from the tempests and droughts that have caused suffering. During his rule and establishment of justice people will no longer speak obscenity, \"work iniquity,\" \"practice hypocrisy,\" or destroy the faith of others.<\/p> <blockquote> Behold, a <i>king<\/i> shall <u>reign in righteousness<\/u><i>,<\/i>     <br>and <i>princes<\/i> shall <u>rule in judgment<\/u><i>.<\/i> (32:1)     <br>And a man shall be as an <i>hiding place<\/i> from the <u>wind<\/u><i>,<\/i>     <br>and a <i>covert<\/i> from the <u>tempest<\/u>;     <br>as <i>rivers of water<\/i> in a <u>dry place<\/u><i>,<\/i>     <br>as the <i>shadow of a great rock<\/i> in a <u>weary land<\/u><i>.<\/i> (32:2)     <br>And the <i>eyes of them<\/i> that <u>see<\/u><i> <\/i><u>shall not be dim<\/u><i>,<\/i>     <br>and the <i>ears of them<\/i> that <u>hear<\/u><i> <\/i><u>shall hearken<\/u><i>.<\/i> (32:3)     <br>The <i>heart<\/i> also of the <u>rash<\/u><i> <\/i><u>shall understand knowledge<\/u><i>,<\/i>     <br>and the <i>tongue<\/i> of the <u>stammerers<\/u><i> <\/i><u>shall be ready to speak plainly<\/u><i>.<\/i> (32:4)     <br>The <i>vile person<\/i> shall be no more called [<u>noble<\/u>],     <br>nor the <i>churl<\/i> said to be <u>bountiful<\/u><i>.<\/i> (32:5)     <br>For the <i>vile person<\/i> will <u>speak<\/u> <u>villainy<\/u><i>,<\/i>     <br>and <i>his heart<\/i> will <u>work<\/u><i> <\/i><u>iniquity<\/u><i>,<\/i>     <br><i>to practice<\/i> <u>hypocrisy<\/u><i>,<\/i>     <br>and <i>to utter<\/i> <u>error<\/u> against the Lord,     <br>to <u>make empty<\/u> the soul <i>of the hungry,<\/i>     <br>and he will <u>cause the drink<\/u> <i>of the thirsty<\/i> <u>to fail<\/u><i>.<\/i> (32:6)     <br>The <i>instruments<\/i> also of the <u>churl<\/u> are <i>evil:<\/i>     <br><u>he<\/u> deviseth <i>wicked devices<\/i>     <br>to destroy the <i>poor<\/i> with <u>lying words <\/u><i>,<\/i>     <br>even when the <i>needy<\/i> <u>speaketh right<\/u><i>.<\/i> (32:7)     <br>But the [<i>noble<\/i>] deviseth [<i>noble<\/i>] <i>things;<\/i>     <br>and by [<i>noble<\/i>] <i>things<\/i> shall <i>he<\/i> stand.
