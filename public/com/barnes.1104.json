It is in the Hiphil conjugation, and is probably a form made from a mixture with the Chaldee. The sense is not doubtful. It means &lsquo;the rivers shall become putrid&mdash;or have an offensive smell;&rsquo; that is, shall become stagnant, and send forth unwholesome &ldquo;miasmata&rdquo; producing sickness, as stagnant waters often do. The Vulgate renders it, &lsquo;And the rivers shall fail.&rsquo; The Septuagint, &lsquo;And the Egyptians shall drink the waters from the sea, but the river shall fail, and be dried up, and the rivers shall fail, and the streams (&delta;&iota;&omega;\u0300&rho;&upsilon;&chi;&epsilon;&sigmaf; dio\u0304ruches) of the river, and all the assembling (&sigma;&upsilon;&nu;&alpha;&gamma;&omega;&gamma;&eta;\u0301 sunago\u0304ge\u0304) waters shall be dried up.&rsquo;<\/p><p><em>And the brooks of defense<\/em>&mdash;Hebrew, &lsquo;The rivers of \u05de\u05e6\u05d5\u05e8 ma\u0302tso\u0302r. The word \u05de\u05e6\u05d5\u05e8 ma\u0302tso\u0302r often means &ldquo;straitness, affliction;&rdquo; then a siege, a wall, a bulwark, a fortification. But, probably, it here means &ldquo;Egypt,&rdquo; or the same as \u05de\u05e6\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd m\u0131\u0302tseray\u0131\u0302m (compare <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4Mzc4XQ==\">Isaiah 37:25<\/a> ; <a class=\"ref\">2 Kings 18:24; Mark 7:12<\/a>). Perhaps the Hebrews may have thought of Egypt as a strongly fortified place, and thus have given the name to it; or possibly this may have been a modification of the name &ldquo;Mitsraim.&rdquo;<\/p><p><em>The reeds and flags<\/em>&mdash;Which grew on the banks of the Nile&mdash;the papyrus, etc. (see the note at <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MDAwXQ==\">Isaiah 18:2<\/a>)<\/p>",
