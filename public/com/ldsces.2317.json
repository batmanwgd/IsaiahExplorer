    "html": "<p>Once again Isaiah used prophetic dualism. His &ldquo;burden&rdquo; on Egypt has (1) a physical fulfillment experienced by the nation and her people both in Isaiah&rsquo;s time and in future times, and (2) a spiritual fulfillment that pertains to the world of the latter days.<\/p><p>Isaiah used a phrase to signal to the reader the parts of his vision that pertained to the last days. &ldquo;In that day,&rdquo; in verses 16, 18, 19, 23, and 24, suggests future fulfillment. (For other uses of this phrase and its meaning see <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODAwN10seyIxNzczNSI6Nn0seyIxNzg4NiI6MTZ9XQ==\">Isaiah 2&ndash;4, 11<\/a>.)<\/p><p>Elder Bruce R. McConkie used a quotation that shows why Isaiah may have used such neighbors as Egypt, Moab, and Babylon to describe the wicked of latter days. Speaking of the world, he said: &ldquo;&lsquo;Babylon marks its idolatry, Egypt its tyranny, Sodom its desperate corruption, Jerusalem its pretensions to sanctity on the ground of spiritual privileges, whilst all the while it is the murderer of Christ in the person of his members.&rsquo; ([Robert Jamieson and others, <em>Commentary on the Whole Bible,<\/em> ] p. 577.)&rdquo; (<em>Doctrinal New Testament Commentary,<\/em> 3:510.)<\/p><p class=\"cite\">LDS Church Educational System Old Testament Student Manual, 1 Kings&ndash;Malachi, Religion 302, Chapter 14, Item 28<\/p>",
