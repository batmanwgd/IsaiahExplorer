    "html": "<p> In the prospect of this ultimate and saving purpose of the mission of Cyrus, viz., the redemption of Israel and the conversion of the heathen, heaven and earth are now summoned to bring forth and pour down spiritual blessings in heavenly gifts, according to the will and in the power of Jehovah, who has in view a new spiritual creation. <em> \u201cCause to trickle down, ye heavens above, and let the blue sky rain down righteousness; let the earth open, and let salvation blossom, and righteousness; let them sprout together: I Jehovah have created it.\u201d<\/em> What the heavens are to cause to trickle down, follows as the object to \u05d9\u05d6\u05bc\u05dc\u05d5\u05bc . And what is to flower when the earth opens (<em> pa\u0302thach <\/em> as in <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 106:17<\/a>; compare <em> aprilis<\/em> and the Neo-Greek <em> anoixis<\/em> , spring), is salvation and righteousness. But <em> tzedek <\/em> (righteousness) is immediately afterwards the object of a new verb; so that \u05d5\u05bc\u05e6\u05d3\u05e7\u05d4 \u05d9\u05e9\u05c1\u05e2 , which are thought of as combined, as the word \u05d9\u05d7\u05d3 (together) shows, are uncoupled in the actual expression. Knobel expresses a different opinion, and assumes that \u05d9\u05e9\u05c1\u05e2 is regarded as a collective noun, and therefore construed with a plural, like \u05d0\u05de\u05e8\u05bc\u05d4 in <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 119:103<\/a>, and \u05d7\u05de\u05d3\u05d4 in <a class=\"ref\">Haggai 2:7<\/a>. But the use of <em> yachad <\/em> (together) favours the other interpretation. The suffix of \u05d1\u05bc\u05e8\u05d0\u05ea\u05d9\u05d5 points to this fulness of righteousness and salvation. It is a creation of Jehovah Himself. Heaven and earth, when co-operating to effect this, are endowed with their capacity through Him from whom cometh every good and perfect gift, and obey now, as at the first, His creative fiat. This <em> \u201crorate caeli desuper et nubes pluant justum ,\u201d<\/em> as the Vulgate renders it, is justly regarded as an old advent cry.<\/p>",
