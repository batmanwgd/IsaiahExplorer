    "html": " <p>As animals are often mistreated, so is Jehovah during his earthly ministry. Though he is &ldquo;harassed&rdquo; or &ldquo;oppressed&rdquo; (<em>niggas <\/em>), he is &ldquo;submissive&rdquo; or &ldquo;afflicted&rdquo; (<em>na&lsquo;aneh <\/em>) and doesn&rsquo;t resist evil. The imagery of a <em>lamb <\/em> led to slaughter alludes to the sacrifice of his life as &ldquo;an offering for guilt&rdquo; under the Law of Moses (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzIyXQ==\">v 10<\/a>), in which a sacrificial animal substitutes for a person who has transgressed. Isaiah thus combines the role of a proxy savior under the terms of the Davidic Covenant with the proxy role of a sacrificial lamb under the Mosaic Code to show the composite nature of Jehovah&rsquo;s saving roles. <\/p> ",
