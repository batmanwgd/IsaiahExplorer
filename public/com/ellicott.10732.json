The words remind us of<a class=\"ref\">Deuteronomy 30:19; Deuteronomy 32:1<\/a> , but the thought was the common inheritance of Hebrew poets (<a class=\"ref\">Psalms 50:4; Jeremiah 6:19; Jeremiah 22:29<\/a>), and we can draw no inference from the parallelism as to the date of either book.<\/p> \n<p>I have nourished and brought up children. The last word has in the Hebrew the emphasis of position: Sons I have reared and brought up. From those who had thus grown up under a father\u2019s care filial duty might have been expected; but it was not so. The sons had rebelled against their father\u2019s control. It is significant that the prophet starts from the thought of the fatherhood of God in His relation to Israel. The people might be unworthy of their election, but He had chosen them (<a class=\"ref\">Exodus 4:22; Deuteronomy 14:1; Hosea 11:1<\/a>).<\/p> ",
