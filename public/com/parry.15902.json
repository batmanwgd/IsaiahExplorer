She was cast off and left in the street to die, but Jehovah, passing by, saw her, ministered to her, and treated her as royalty. She proved unfaithful to him and so was taken into exile and again treated with shame and disgust. But in the latter days Jehovah will again rescue her and return her to her former glory, renewing his covenant with her.<\/p> <p><i>no man went through thee.<\/i> The city of Jerusalem became so hated that no commerce or travel took place there (34:10; <a class=\"ref\">Ezek. 14:15; 33:28<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\">Zeph. 3:6<\/a>). This expression also symbolizes the people of Israel, who were shunned for centuries.<\/p> <p> <i>eternal excellency\/joy of many generations.<\/i> Whereas the city of Jerusalem was seen formerly as low and disgusting, it has now been transformed, becoming the royal city of the Lord and his people. Such it shall be for all time (eternal), becoming a source of joy to people from generation to generation. Again, the condition of the city stands as a symbol for the people who inherit it; they also will be transformed and be a source of joy to the Lord.<\/p> ",
