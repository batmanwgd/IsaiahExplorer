    "html": " <i>Drop down, ye heavens&hellip;righteousness.<\/i> Instead of the sky dropping rain, it is dropping down righteousness. Perhaps this phrase refers to revelation, which comes down from the heavens and enables us to come to righteousness.<\/p> <p><i>earth open.<\/i> This expression has at least two meanings. One is to receive the righteousness (and revelation) from above, even as the earth receives the rain. Another, according to Elder Orson Pratt and others of the early Brethren of this dispensation, is to prophesy of the coming forth of the Book of Mormon. <\/p> <p><i>bring forth\/spring up.<\/i> This sweet prayer<b> <\/b>is a blessing the Lord pronounces on us, that righteousness, like plants, will spring forth on the earth. As Creator, the Lord implies, he has the power to bring about such a blessing (26:19). With our agency, we can choose to participate in this blessing. This passage may also refer to the coming of the Messiah, whose name is Son of Righteousness (<a class=\"ref\">3 Ne. 25:2<\/a>). <\/p> <p><i>salvation.<\/i> The Hebrew word used here, <i>yesha\u2014<\/i>also meaning \"deliverance\"\u2014 comes from the same root as the names <i> Isaiah <\/i> and <i>Joshua.<\/i> In the Greek New Testament the name became <i>Jesus.<\/i> Could Isaiah be saying in a symbolic way, \"Let the heavens and the earth bring forth Jesus, our deliverer\"?<\/p> ",
