    "title": "Jerusalem to Be Brought Down by the Lord",
    "html": " <p>Ariel, a prophetic name for Jerusalem, will be destroyed by a \"multitude of all the nations\" (29:7-8) that will \"distress,\" \"camp against,\" \"lay siege\" to, and \"raise forts against\" her (29:2-3). This destruction will occur because Jerusalem's inhabitants have rejected the Lord's prophets and seers (29:10). Historically, Jerusalem was destroyed by the Babylonians, Romans, and other nations. Prophetically, a \"multitude of all the nations\" will yet \"lay siege against\" Jerusalem before the second coming of Jesus (<a class=\"ref\">Zech. 14:2,  16<\/a>). <\/p> <p> Nephi paraphrased a few of Isaiah's words, as recorded in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODE5NiI6M30=\">Isa. 29:2-4<\/a>, likening the people of Jerusalem to his own people and their destruction (<a class=\"ref\">2 Ne. 26:15<\/a>). The Nephite nation was indeed destroyed according to the words of Nephi in a manner similar to the destruction of Jerusalem.<\/p> <p> When Joseph Smith translated the Bible, he made a number of notable changes in this section of <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isa. 29<\/a>. The King James Version second-person forms, <i>thou, thee,<\/i> and <i>thy,<\/i> which refer to Jerusalem, are changed to the third-person singular forms <i>her<\/i> and <i>she<\/i> in eight instances in verses 3-5 of the Joseph Smith Translation. The Joseph Smith Translation also replaces <i>thou<\/i> with <i>they<\/i> in verse 6, changing the referent from Jerusalem to her enemies.<\/p> <blockquote> Woe to Ariel, to Ariel, the city where David dwelt!     <br>add ye year to year; let them kill sacrifices. (29:1)     <br>Yet I will distress Ariel, and there shall be heaviness and sorrow:     <br>[for thus hath the Lord said unto me], It shall be unto Ariel. (29:2)     <br>[That] <i>I [the Lord] will camp <\/i><u>against [her<\/u>] round about,     <br>and <i>will lay siege <\/i><u>against [her<\/u>] with a mount,     <br>and<i> I will raise forts <\/i><u>against [her<\/u>]. (29:3)     <br>And [she] shalt be brought down, and [shall] <i>speak<\/i> <u>out of the ground<\/u><i>,<\/i>     <br>and [her] <i>speech<\/i> shall be <u>low out of the dust<\/u><i>,<\/i>     <br>and [her] <i>voice<\/i> shall be, as of one that hath a familiar spirit, <u>out of the ground<\/u><i>,<\/i>     <br>and [her] <i>speech<\/i> shall <u>whisper out of the dust<\/u><i>.<\/i> (29:4)     <br>Moreover the <i>multitude of [her] strangers<\/i> shall be like small <i><u>dust<\/u>,<\/i>     <br>and the <i>multitude of the terrible ones<\/i> shall be as <u>chaff<\/u>     <br>that passeth away: yea, it shall be at an instant suddenly. (29:5)     <br>[For they shall] be visited of the Lord of Hosts,     <br>with <i>thunder,<\/i> and with <i>earthquake,<\/i> and [with] a <i>great noise,<\/i>     <br>and with <i>storm,<\/i> and [with] <i>tempest,<\/i> and [with] the <i>flame of devouring fire.<\/i> (29:6)     <br>And the multitude of all the nations that <i>fight<\/i> against <u>Ariel<\/u><i>, <\/i>     <br><i>even all that fight<\/i> against <i>her<\/i> and her munition<b>, <\/b>     <br><b>and that <i>distress<\/i> <u>her<\/u><i>,<\/i> shall be as a dream of a night vision. (29:7)<\/b>     <br><b>[Yea,] it shall [be unto them even as unto a] <i>hungry man [who] dreameth,<\/i><\/b>     <br><b>and, behold, he <u>eateth<\/u><i>,<\/i><\/b>     <br><b>but he <i>awaketh,<\/i> and his <u>soul is empty<\/u>:<\/b>     <br><b>or [like unto] a <i>thirsty man [who] dreameth,<\/i> and, behold, he <u>drinketh<\/u>;<\/b>     <br><b>but he <i>awaketh,<\/i> and, behold, he is <u>faint<\/u><i>,<\/i> and his soul hath appetite:<\/b>     <br><b>[Yea, even] so shall the multitude of all the nations be, that fight against mount Zion.
