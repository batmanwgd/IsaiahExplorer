    "html": " <p> <em>The cormorant\u2014 <\/em> <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05e7\u05d0\u05ea <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">,kaath <\/span>,, the pelican, from the root <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05e7\u05d9\u05d0 <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">,ki <\/span>,, to vomit, because it is said she swallows shell-fish, and when the heat of her stomach has killed the fish, she vomits the shells, takes out the dead fish, and eats them. <\/p>,\n\n <p> <em>The bittern\u2014 <\/em> <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05e7\u05e4\u05d3 <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">,kippod <\/span>,, the hedge-hog, or porcupine. <\/p>,\n\n <p> <em>The owl\u2014 <\/em> <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d9\u05e0\u05e9\u05d5\u05e3 <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">,yanshoph <\/span>,, the bittern, from <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05e0\u05e9\u05e3 <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">,nashaph <\/span>,, to blow, because of the blowing noise it makes, almost like the lowing of an ox. My old MS. Bible renders the words thus: - The foule in face like an asse, and the yrchoun, and the snyte (snipe.) <\/p>,\n\n <p> <em>The line of confusion, and the stones of emptiness \"The plummet of emptiness over her scorched plains\"\u2014 <\/em>,The word <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d7\u05e8\u05d9\u05d4 <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">,choreyha <\/span>,, joined to the 12th verse, embarrasses it, and makes it inexplicable. At least I do not know that any one has yet made out the construction, or given any tolerable explication of it. I join it to the 11th verse, and supply a letter or two, which seem to have been lost. Fifteen MSS. five ancient, and two editions, read <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d7\u05d5\u05e8\u05d9\u05d4 <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">,choreyha <\/span>,; the first printed edition of 1486, I think nearer to the truth, <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d7\u05e8\u05d9\u05d4 \u05d7\u05d5\u05e8 <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">,chor choreyha <\/span>,. I read <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d1\u05d7\u05e8\u05e8\u05d9\u05d4 <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">,becharereyha <\/span>,, or <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d7\u05e8\u05e8\u05d9\u05d4 \u05e2\u05dc <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">,al chorereyha <\/span>,; see <a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 17:6 <\/a>. A MS. has <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d7\u05d3\u05d9\u05d4 <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">,chodiah <\/span>,, and the Syriac reads <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d7\u05d3\u05d5\u05d4 <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">,chaduah <\/span>,, <i>gaudium <\/i>,, joining it to the two preceding words; which he likewise reads differently, but without improving the sense. However, his authority is clear for dividing the verses as they are here divided. I read <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05e9\u05dd <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">,shem <\/span>,, as a noun. They shall boast, <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d9\u05e7\u05e8\u05d0\u05d5 <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">,yikreu <\/span>,; see <a class=\"ref\">Proverbs 20:6 <\/a>. <\/p>,",
