    "html": "<p> But just because this lion is Judah and its government, the summons goes forth to the Moabites, who have fled to Edom, and even to <em> Sela<\/em> , i.e., Petra (<em> Wady Musa<\/em> ), near Mount Hor in Arabia Petraea, to which it gave its name, to turn for protection to Jerusalem. <em> \u201cSend a land-ruler's tribute of lambs from Sela desert-wards to the mountain of the daughter of Zion.\u201d<\/em> This v. is like a long-drawn trumpet-blast. The prophecy against Moab takes the same turn here as in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3OTYxLDE4MDA1LDE4MDIxLDE4MDk2XQ==\">Isaiah 14:32; Isaiah 18:7; Isaiah 19:16., Isaiah 23:18<\/a>. The judgment first of all produces slavish fear; and this is afterwards refined into loving attachment. Submission to the house of David is Moab's only deliverance. This is what the prophet, weeping with those that weep, calls out to them in such long-drawn, vehement, and urgent tones, even into the farthest hiding-place in which they have concealed themselves, viz., the rocky city of the Edomites. The tribute of lambs which was due to the ruling prince is called briefly <em> car mo\u0304she\u0304l<\/em> -<em> 'eretz <\/em> . This tribute, which the holders of the pasture-land so rich in flocks have hitherto sent to Samaria (<a class=\"ref\">2 Kings 3:4<\/a>), they are now to send to Jerusalem, the \u201cmountain of the daughter of Zion\u201d (as in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODgzXQ==\">Isaiah 10:32<\/a>, compared with <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MDA1XQ==\">Isaiah 18:7<\/a>), the way to which lay through \u201c<em> the desert<\/em> ,\u201d i.e., first of all in a diagonal direction through the Arabah, which stretched downwards to Aelath.<\/p>",
