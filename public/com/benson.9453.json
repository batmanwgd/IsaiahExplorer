Which was in some sort fulfilled by Cyrus, Ahasuerus, and some few others of the Persian kings or queens; but much more truly and fully by those many kings and emperors of the Gentile world who, after the time of Christ, did both themselves embrace the true religion, and also provide for the reception and establishment of it in their dominions. <i>They shall bow down to thee, <\/i> &c.\u2014They shall highly reverence and honour thee, and shall most humbly and readily submit themselves unto thee. This was not verified in any of the Persian kings, but only in those kings or emperors who were converted to the Christian faith and church. <i>And lick up the dust of thy feet \u2014 <\/i> These expressions are borrowed from the manners of the eastern people in their prostrations and adorations, who bowed so low as to touch and kiss the ground. <i>For they shall not be ashamed that wait for <\/i> <i>me <\/i>\u2014Their expectations shall not be disappointed, but abundantly satisfied. <\/p> ",
