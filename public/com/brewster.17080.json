The apostle Paul used this same phrase in writing to the early Saints in Colosse (<a class=\"ref\">Col. 3:3<\/a>). The Prophet Joseph Smith gave an interpretation to this phrase. Placing his hands upon one of the faithful members of the Church, he said: 'Your life is hid with Christ in God, and so are many others. Nothing but the unpardonable sin can prevent you from inheriting eternal life for you are sealed up by the power of the priesthood unto eternal life, having taken the step necessary for that purpose.' (HC 5:391.) Thus, to be hid from the world is to be assured of eternal life or to have one's calling and election made sure.\" (DCE, 241-42.)<\/p>",
