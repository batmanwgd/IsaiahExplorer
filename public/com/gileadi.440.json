His pleading with Jehovah in the midst of his agony, and his yielding up his life to his God, lends substance to his intercessory prayer on behalf of his people (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 37:15-20<\/a>). As a type of the suffering of Jehovah&rsquo;s end-time servant, Hezekiah &ldquo;pours out his soul unto death&rdquo; and &ldquo;bears the sins of many&rdquo;&mdash;until Jehovah &ldquo;sees the toil of his soul and is satisfied&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 53:11-12<\/a>). Hezekiah thus becomes a classic role model of a proxy savior under the terms of the Davidic Covenant.<\/p>",
