The Holy Spirit may well be called <i>a spirit of judgment, <\/i>because he executes judgment in the church, and in the consciences of men, convincing sinners of sin, leading them to judge and condemn themselves, and humbling them before God. And the same Spirit may be properly called a <i>spirit of burning, <\/i>because he burns up and consumes the dross which is in the church, and in the hearts of sinners, operates like refiners\u2019 fire, purges believers as gold and silver are purged, (<a class=\"ref\">Malachi 3:3<\/a>,) inflames their souls with love to God and zeal for his glory, and transforms them into his holy nature and image. This was effectually done with respect to those Jews that embraced the gospel in the early days of Christianity. <\/p>",
