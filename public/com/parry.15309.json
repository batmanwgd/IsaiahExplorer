    "html": " <p>One common link between the previous section and this one is <i>fire\u2014<\/i>the wicked will be destroyed by fire at Jesus' second coming, while the righteous will come to dwell in the \"everlasting burnings\" of the celestial world. The section begins with two parallel rhetorical questions asking who can dwell with God in his fire (33:14); these are followed by a response to the questions, detailing the attributes of one who is able to dwell with God (33:15), which in turn is succeeded by a description of the blessings of those who will be privileged to dwell with God (33:16-17). This passage has the same structure as two psalms that give the requirements for entrance into the temple (<a class=\"ref\">Ps. 15,  24<\/a>), both of which have two rhetorical questions, a response to the questions, and a description of the blessings. The psalms, however, deal with the earthly temple, in contrast to this section of Isaiah, which asks, \"Who is worthy to enter God's temple in heaven, or the celestial kingdom?\"<\/p> <blockquote><i>Who among us shall dwell with<\/i> the <u>devouring fire?<\/u>     <br><i>who among us shall dwell with<\/i> <u>everlasting burnings?<\/u> (33:14)     <br>He that <i>walketh<\/i> <u>righteously<\/u><i>,<\/i>     <br>and <i>speaketh<\/i> <u>uprightly<\/u>;     <br>he that <i>despiseth<\/i> the <u>gain of oppressions<\/u><i>,<\/i>     <br>that <i>shaketh<\/i> his <i>hands<\/i> <u>from holding of bribes<\/u><i>,<\/i>     <br>that <i>stoppeth<\/i> his <u>ears<\/u> from hearing of blood,     <br>and <i>shutteth<\/i> his <u>eyes<\/u> from seeing evil; (33:15)     <br>He shall <i>dwell<\/i> on <i>high:<\/i>     <br>his <i>place of defence<\/i> shall be the [<u>stronghold<\/u>] <u> of rocks<\/u>:     <br><i>bread<\/i> shall <u>be given<\/u> him;     <br>his <i>waters<\/i> shall <u>be sure<\/u><i>.<\/i> (33:16)     <br>Thine <i>eyes shall see<\/i> the <u>king in his beauty<\/u>:     <br><i>they shall behold<\/i> the <u>land that is very far off<\/u><i>.<\/i> (33:17)<\/blockquote> ",
