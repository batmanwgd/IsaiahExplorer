    "html": "<p><em>And they shall be afraid<\/em>&mdash;The Jews, or the party or faction among the Jews, that were expecting aid from allied Ethiopia and Egypt. When they shall see them vanquished, they shall apprehend a similar danger to themselves; and they shall be ashamed that they ever confided in a people so little able to aid them, instead of trusting in the arm of God.<\/p><p><em>Egypt their glory<\/em>&mdash;Their boast, as if Egypt was able to save them. The word rendered here &lsquo;glory&rsquo; (\u05ea\u05e4\u05d0\u05e8\u05ea tiph&lsquo;ereth) means properly, &ldquo;ornament, praise, honor;&rdquo; and then it may mean the &ldquo;object&rdquo; of glory, or that in which people boast or confide. That is its sense here (compare <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3OTI2XQ==\">Isaiah 10:12; Isaiah 13:19<\/a> ; <a class=\"ref\">Zechariah 12:7<\/a>).<\/p>",
