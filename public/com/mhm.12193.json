Here is,  I. The event itself foretold, that Jerusalem should be greatly  distressed,   <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 29:1-4<\/a>),  but that their enemies, who distressed them, should be baffled and  defeated,   <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 29:5<\/a>.  II. A reproof to three sorts of sinners:--  1. Those that were stupid, and regardless of the warnings which the  prophet gave them,   <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 29:9-12<\/a>.  2. Those that were formal and hypocritical in their religious  performances,   <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 29:13<\/a>.  3. Those politicians that atheistically and profanely despised God's  providence, and set up their own projects in competition with it,   <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 29:15<\/a>.  III. Precious promises of grace and mercy to a distinguished remnant  whom God would sanctify, and in whom he would be sanctified, when their  enemies and persecutors should be cut off,   <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 29:17-24<\/a>.<\/p>",
