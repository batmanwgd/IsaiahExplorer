But here the poet tells in anticipation how grateful the people on earth are to have \u201crest\u201d (v. 7) from the repeated blows of the oppressor\u2019s rod (vv. 5\u20136). The Lord \u201chas broken the rod.\u201d What good news! In the years between 855 and 555 <small>B.C<\/small>., we almost lose count of the number of times a rampaging Mesopotamian army devastated Israel and Judah. What good news to know that the hammer blows are over.<\/p>     <p>\u2003Nor is it just human beings who are glad to know that the reign of terror is over. The whole creation, including the trees, are glad (v. 8). Isaiah here seems to show an awareness of the writings of the Assyrian kings, who regularly boasted how they cut down the mighty forests of Lebanon both for lumber for their engines of war and also for the beautification of their palaces and temples. Human pride sees both humans and nature as fodder to be consumed in support of its towering pretensions, so even nature breathes a sigh of relief when the news of that pride\u2019s death is announced.<\/p>     ",
