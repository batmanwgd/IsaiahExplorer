    "html": "<p><em>The earth is utterly broken down<\/em>&mdash;The effect as it were of an earthquake where everything is thrown into commotion and ruin.<\/p><p><em>The earth is moved exceedingly<\/em>&mdash;Everything in this verse is intense and emphatic. The verbs are in the strongest form of emphasis: &lsquo;By breaking, the land is broken;&rsquo; &lsquo;by scattering, the land is scattered;&rsquo; &lsquo;by commotion, the land is moved.&rsquo; The repetition also of the expression in the same sense three times, is a strong form of emphasis; and the whole passage is designed to denote the utter desolation and ruin that had come upon the land.<\/p> ",
