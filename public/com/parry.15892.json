But the overall context is the latter days. Not only will the Gentiles gather to Zion but they will also carry many riches with them. The gifts they take to the Lord at the temple of Zion\u2014gold, incense, praises\u2014are similar to the gifts the wise men took to the Lord as a baby (<a class=\"ref\">Matt. 2:11<\/a>). <\/p> ",
