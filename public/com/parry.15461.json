    "html": " <p><i> Isaiah addresses a number of issues that concern us as members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. We need to be reminded often that we are the Lord's \"chosen\" people so that we will order our lives accordingly. We need to know, at a young age, that God will direct each one of us through life; he will hold our right hand and assure each of us, \"Fear not; I will help thee\" (41:13). And if we are ever thirsty, physically or spiritually, our small, empty cups will never suffice, for God desires to give us a great river full of water to fill our needs.<\/i><\/p> ",
