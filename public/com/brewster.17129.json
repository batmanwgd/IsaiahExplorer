Perhaps more importantly, He knows how to speak to Israel, whether to comfort her or to appropriately rebuke her. A similar promise is given by Jesus to His disciples. (<a class=\"ref\">Luke 21:12-15<\/a>.) Monte Nyman suggests that \"verse 4 also fits the calling and mission of Joseph Smith and the elders of restored Israel, who were to cause the wisdom of the wise men to perish (see <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MjA4XQ==\">Isaiah 29:14<\/a>).\" (GAWI, 192.) Victor Ludlow cautions, \"we should not limit these references to the life of Christ, but should try to apply them to many of God's chosen servants.\" (IPSP, 422.)<\/p>",
