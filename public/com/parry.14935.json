    "html": " <p> This revelation given to Isaiah is yet another prophecy directed to one of the world's kingdoms. It shows that the Lord's prophets do not serve the house of Israel alone. The Philistines are warned against rejoicing over the temporary defeat of the Assyrian forces because Assyria eventually regroups, wars against Philistia, and destroys her. Meanwhile, the Lord has established Zion, and all who wish to become a part of her will find rest and peace.<\/p> <blockquote>In the year that king Ahaz died was this burden. (14:28)     <br>Rejoice not thou, whole Palestina, because the rod of him that smote thee is broken;     <br>for out of the <i>serpent's root <\/i>shall come forth a <u>cockatrice<\/u>,     <br>and <i>his fruit<\/i> shall be a fiery <u>flying serpent<\/u>. (14:29)     <br>And the <i>first-born of the poor<\/i> <u>shall feed<\/u>,     <br>and the <i>needy<\/i> <u>shall lie down in safety<\/u>;     <br>and I <i>will kill<\/i> <u>thy root<\/u> with famine,     <br>and [I] <i>shall slay<\/i> <u>thy remnant<\/u>. (14:30)     <br><i>Howl,<\/i> <u>O gate<\/u>;     <br><i>cry,<\/i> <u>O city<\/u>;     <br>thou, whole Palestina, art dissolved; for there shall come from the north a smoke, and none shall be alone in his appointed times. (14:31)     <br>What shall then answer the messengers of the nations? That the Lord hath founded Zion, and the poor of his people shall trust in it. (14:32)<\/blockquote> ",
