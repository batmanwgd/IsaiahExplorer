Romney declared: \"This Church [The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints] is the standard which Isaiah said the Lord would set up for the people in the latter days. \u2026 This Church is the ensign on the mountain spoken of by the Old Testament prophets.\" (CR, April 1961, p. 119.)<\/p>     <p>Victor Ludlow provides a variety of possible interpretations of \"ensign,\" including the scriptural justification for each. He concludes by saying, \"we see that an ensign in the last days can refer to Zion, the gospel, missionary work, the gathering, and the Book of Mormon. . . . In short, the term <i>ensign<\/i> encompasses the Lord's whole work, and all aspects of his Church serve as his 'standard' to the world.\" (IPSP, 122-23; see also <a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 115:5-6<\/a>; commentary on <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NjU5XQ==\">Isaiah 49:22<\/a> and <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODk1XQ==\">Isaiah 11:10<\/a>, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzUyXQ==\">12<\/a> in this volume.)<\/p>",
