    "html": " <p> (19) When it shall hail, coming down on the forest.\u2014Better, But it shall hail. A time of sharp judgment, \u201chailstones and coals of fire,\u201d is to precede that of blessedness and peace. Of such a judgment \u201chail\u201d was the natural symbol. (Comp. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MjQ4XQ==\">Isaiah 30:30<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\">Ezekiel 13:13<\/a>.) The \u201cforest\u201d stands in the symbolism of prophecy for the rulers and princes of any kingdom, as in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODg1XQ==\">Isaiah 10:34<\/a> for those of Assyria, and here probably of Judah. Not a few commentators refer the words here also to Assyria, but the city that follows is clearly Jerusalem, and the interpretation given above harmonises accordingly better with the context. Of that city Isaiah says that it shall be \u201cbrought down to a low estate,\u201d its pride humbled even to the ground, in order that it may afterwards be exalted. <\/p> ",
