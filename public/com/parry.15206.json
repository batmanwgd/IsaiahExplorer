    "html": " <i>fitches are not threshed with a threshing instrument. <\/i>A threshing instrument, drawn by an ass or oxen, was \"dragged over the grain to separate kernels of grain from the husks.\" Fitches and cumin bear small, delicate seeds. If a threshing machine or cart wheel were used to thresh them, they would be completely destroyed or lost. Therefore, the \"fitches are beaten out with a staff, and the cummin with a rod\" to loosen and separate the seeds. Isaiah's message seems to be this: The Lord uses different means to punish or chastise the unrighteous. Some he crushes with a threshing instrument or cart wheel; others he beats with a rod or staff.<\/p> ",
