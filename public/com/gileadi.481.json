    "html": " <p>The name Jehovah, which consists of a unique form of the Hebrew verb &ldquo;to be&rdquo; (cf. <a class=\"ref\">Exodus 3:14 <\/a>), contains the idea of a God who is self-existent and who therefore doesn&rsquo;t resemble the false gods or material objects people adore (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDM5LDE4NTk2XQ==\">Isaiah 40:18; 46:9 <\/a>). By creating their &ldquo;wrought idols,&rdquo; his people may even attempt to simulate his likeness, but such efforts dishonor him who said, &ldquo;You shall have no other gods before me. You shall not make yourself any graven image or any likeness of what is in heaven above or in the earth beneath or in the waters under the earth&rdquo; (<a class=\"ref\">Exodus 20:3-4 <\/a>; cf. <a class=\"ref\">Deuteronomy 4:23 <\/a>). <\/p> <p>Unless and until Jehovah&rsquo;s people cease worshiping material things and instead &ldquo;love Jehovah your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul and with all your might&rdquo; (<a class=\"ref\">Deuteronomy 6:5 <\/a>), they can&rsquo;t attain a true perception of God nor praise or glorify him. The very nature of spiritual blindness that comes from yielding to substitutes of God is such that, while people are unable to perceive the truth of God, they may nevertheless believe that what they have learned of God is sufficient, or that it is all that is possible to know about him, in that way sabotaging their own relationship with him. <\/p> ",
