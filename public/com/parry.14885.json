During this destruction, God's servants \"shall sing for joy of heart,\" but the wicked \"shall cry for sorrow of heart, and shall howl for vexation of spirit\" (65:14). \"O ye ought to begin to howl and mourn, because of the great destruction which at this time doth await you, except ye shall repent\" (<a class=\"ref\">Hel. 9:22<\/a>). <\/p> <p><i>day of the Lord.<\/i> This refers to our day, or the last days (2:12).<\/p> <p><i>at hand.<\/i> The phrase means \"near\" or \"soon.\"<\/p> <p><i>destruction from the Almighty.<\/i> Christ will destroy the wicked when he comes again.<\/p> ",
