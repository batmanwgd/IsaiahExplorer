The <i>thirsty<\/i> are those who thirst not for actual water but for the spiritual salvation that only Jesus Christ can provide.<\/p> <p><i>floods. <\/i>God is generous with salvation; he will send floods, not simply a canteen full of water upon us to quench our thirst.<\/p> <p><i>dry ground. <\/i>This term refers to Israel's offspring who, upon receiving the spiritual water and floods, will spring up like willows (44:4). They will recognize the source of their spiritual light and will say, \"I am the Lord's\" (44:5).<\/p> <p><i>I will pour my spirit upon thy seed. <\/i>This phrase parallels <i>I will pour water upon him that is thirsty,<\/i> for the words <i>I will pour<\/i> and <i>upon<\/i> are found in both phrases. The Lord promises to pour his Spirit on Israel's seed (which includes us) as one pours water on the thirsty (32:15; <a class=\"ref\">Ezek. 39:29<\/a>). This prophecy was partially fulfilled when the Spirit descended upon many of Christ's followers after Christ was resurrected (<a class=\"ref\">Acts 2:1-4<\/a>) however Peter indicated that the fulness of this prophecy would \"come to pass in the last days\" (<a class=\"ref\">Acts 2:17<\/a>; see <a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 95:4<\/a>). <\/p> ",
