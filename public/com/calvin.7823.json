    "html": "<p><i>He was punished. <\/i> Here the Prophet applauds the obedience of Christ in suffering death; for if his death had not been voluntary, he would not have been regarded as having satisfied for our disobedience. \u201cAs by one man\u2019s disobedience,\u201d says Paul, \u201call became sinners, so by one man\u2019s obedience many were made righteous. ( <a class=\"ref\">Romans 5:19<\/a>) And elsewhere, \u201cHe became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.\u201d ( <a class=\"ref\">Philippians 2:8<\/a>) This was the reason of his silence at the judgment\u00adseat of Pilate, though he had a just defense to offer; for, having become answerable for our guilt, he wished to submit silently to the sentence, that we might loudly glory in the righteousness of faith obtained through free grace.<\/p> \n<p><i>As a lamb shall he be led to the slaughter. <\/i> We are here exhorted to patience and meekness, that, following the example of Christ, we may be ready to endure reproaches and cruel assaults, distress and torture. In this sense Peter quotes this passage, showing that we ought to become like Christ our Head, that we may imitate his patience and submissiveness. ( <a class=\"ref\">1 Peter 2:23<\/a>) In the word<i>lamb<\/i> there is probably an allusion to the sacrifices under the Law; and in this sense he is elsewhere called \u201cthe Lamb of God.\u201d ( <a class=\"ref\">John 1:29<\/a>)<\/p> ",
