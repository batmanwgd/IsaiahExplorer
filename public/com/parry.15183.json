    "html": " <i>the priest and the prophet have erred through strong drink. <\/i>Isaiah, a prophet of the Southern Kingdom of Judah, turns his attention to the corrupt priests and prophets of the Northern Kingdom. This may also refer to apostate priests and prophets of the last days. He mentions the wine of the priest and prophet twice and their <i>strong drink<\/i> three times; they have <i>erred<\/i> twice, they are \"out of the way\" twice, and \"swallowed up\" once. But inasmuch as Isaiah is using metaphors, he presents the meaning behind his words: \"they err in vision\" and \"they stumble in judgment.\" In short, they are drunk with wickedness to the point of spiritual staggering.<\/p> <p><i>they err in vision, they stumble in judgment. <\/i>It was the prophets' privilege to receive visions on behalf of the people, but they erred in vision; and it was the priests' privilege to represent the nation before God and to pronounce just judgments for the nation (<a class=\"ref\">Mal. 2:7<\/a>), but they stumbled in judgment. The lives of the priests and prophets should have reflected the teachings of Jehovah, but they had become so immersed in the intoxication of sin that they had completely disassociated themselves from him. This verse refers also to the false religious leaders of Joseph Smith's day\u2014and perhaps of ours. <\/p> ",
