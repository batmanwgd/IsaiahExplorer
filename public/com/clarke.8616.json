The conjecture is ingenious; but it is much more probable that the word <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05dc\u05d1 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">leb<\/span>  is lost out of the text; for all the ancient versions render the phrase to the same sense, as if it were fully expressed, <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05dc\u05d1 \u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05de\u05d5 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">yasimu leb<\/span> ; and the Chaldee renders it paraphrastically, yet still retaining the very words in his paraphrase, <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05dc\u05d1\u05d4\u05d5\u05df \u05e2\u05dc \u05d3\u05d7\u05dc\u05ea\u05d9 \u05d5\u05e9\u05d5\u05d5\u05df <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">vishavvun dechalti al lebehon<\/span>, \"that they may put my fear in their heart.\" See also  <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTg0NzQ=\">Isaiah 41:22<\/a>, where the same phrase is used.<\/p>",
