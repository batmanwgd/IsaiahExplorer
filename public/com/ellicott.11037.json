Instead of \u201cscattered and peeled, \u201cwe are to read tall and polished, as describing the physique which had probably impressed itself on Isaiah\u2019s mind. (Comp. the Sabeans as \u201cmen of stature\u201d in<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NTc2XQ==\">Isaiah 45:14<\/a> .) They were terrible then, as they had ever been (i.e., imperious and mighty), a nation that treadeth down its foes. Instead of \u201cmeted out and trodden down,\u201d they are a nation of command, command (or, perhaps, \u201cstrength, strength\u201d). The rivers are literally the affluents of the Nile that intersect and fertilise (not \u201cspoil\u201d) the hills and valleys of Nubia. Some commentators, however, though with less probability, accept the Authorised version, and refer the words to Israel, as \u201cscattered and plundered,\u201d with its land \u201cspoiled\u201d by the \u201crivers of invading armies (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODE1XQ==\">Isaiah 8:7<\/a>).<\/p> ",
