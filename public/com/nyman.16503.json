    "html": "          <p>The passage in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODQ4MiI6NH0=\">Isaiah 42:1-4<\/a> is the first of four so-called servant songs in the book of Isaiah (see also 49:1-6; 50:4-9; 52:13-53:12). The servant of the songs is usually considered to be Christ, although there are many other interpretations. Some say it is Israel collectively; others cite various historical figures of the past; still others point to an historical figure in the future; and yet others say it is an ideal figure. To those who identify the servant as Israel collectively, the argument is raised that the servant goes far beyond the Israel which was known in Isaiah's day or the days following Isaiah, when most scholars feel these servant songs were written. With this we would heartily agree, because the designation of Israel as the servant in the Isaiah text has reference to the future restored Israel, as already identified and discussed in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODQ2MCI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 41:8-9<\/a>. However, not all four songs necessarily refer to the same servant, nor is the servant in any one song necessarily limited to a single identification. There are possibly dual representations for the servant, with reference either to different time periods or to specific and broader meanings in each situation. Therefore, the servant must be identified within the given context in each case.<\/p>     ",
