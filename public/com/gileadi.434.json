    "html": "<p>Directly related to Assyria&rsquo;s invasion of the Promised Land &ldquo;in those days,&rdquo; and to the mortal threat Assyria posed to Hezekiah&rsquo;s people, is the mortal threat of the king&rsquo;s illness. Hezekiah&rsquo;s role as his people&rsquo;s proxy savior requires more than his vocal intercessory prayer on their behalf (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODM2OCI6Nn0=\">Isaiah 37:15-20<\/a>). It involves answering for their disloyalties to their God in the pattern of ancient Near Eastern emperor-vassal covenants. In other words, under the terms of the Davidic Covenant, Hezekiah takes upon himself his people&rsquo;s transgressions and their covenant curses when seeking Jehovah&rsquo;s physical protection.<\/p> ",
