    "html": "<p>The negative answer to this question is the direct result of what precedes, but a still further proof is given in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTg1OTM=\">Isaiah 46:6<\/a>, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTg1OTQ=\">Isaiah 46:7<\/a>. <i>\u201cThey who pour gold out of the bag, and weigh silver with the balance, hire a goldsmith to make it into a god, that they may fall down, yea, throw themselves down. They lift it up, carry it away upon their shoulder, and set it down in its place: there it stands; from its place it does not move: men also cry to it, but it does not answer; it saves no one out of distress.\u201d<\/i> There is no necessity for assuming that <span class=\"normal hebrew\">\u05d4\ufb36\u05dc\u05d9\u05dd<\/span> is used in the place of the finite verb, as Hitzig imagines, or as equivalent to <span class=\"normal hebrew\">\u05d6\u05dc\u05d9\u05dd<\/span> <span class=\"normal hebrew\">\u05d4\u05dd<\/span>, as Rosenm\u00fcller and Gesenius suppose; but up to <span class=\"normal hebrew\">\u05d9\u05e9\u05c2\ufb3b\u05e8\ufb35<\/span> the whole is subject, and therefore <span class=\"normal hebrew\">\u05d9\u05e9\u05c1\u05e7\u05dc\ufb35<\/span> is the point at which the change into the finite verb occurs (Ges. \u00a7131, 2). The point in <i>(<span class=\"translit\">hazza\u0302l\u0131\u0304m<\/span>) is not the extravagant expenditure, as Ewald thinks, but the mean origin of the god, which commences with the pouring out of gold from a purse ((<span class=\"translit\">zu\u0304l<\/span>) = (<span class=\"translit\">za\u0302lal<\/span>), to shake, to pour out). (<span class=\"translit\">Qa\u0302neh<\/span>) is the lever of the scales (<span class=\"greek normal\"> \u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03c9\u0301\u03bd <\/span>). The metal weighed out is given to a goldsmith, who plates the idol with the gold, and makes the ornaments for it of silver. When it is finished, they lift it up, or shoulder it (<span class=\"normal hebrew\">\u05d9\ufb49\u05c2\u05d0\u05d4\ufb35<\/span> with a distinctive Great Telisha), carry it home, and set it down in the place which it is to have under it<\/i> (<span class=\"normal hebrew\">\ufb4a\u05d7\ufb4a\u05d9\u05d5<\/span>). There it stands firm, immoveable, and also deaf and dumb, hearing no one, answering no one, and helping no one. The subject to <span class=\"normal hebrew\">\u05d9\u05e6\u05e2\u05e7<\/span> is any <span class=\"normal hebrew\">\u05e6\u05e2\u05e7<\/span>. The first admonition closes here. The gods who are carried fall without being able to save themselves, whereas Israel's God carries and saves His people; He, the Incomparable, more especially in contrast with the lifeless puppets of idols.<br><\/p>",
