I will not treat thee with moderation and gentleness, as those men who have not quite put off humanity use to do, but like a lion, to tear thee to pieces: see <a class=\"ref\">Hosea 5:14 <\/a>; and <a class=\"ref\">Hosea 13:7-8 <\/a>. Thou shalt feel the most dreadful effects of my anger, and I will show no humanity or pity toward thee. The original expression, <span class=\"hebrew_text\">,\u05dc\u05d0 \u05d0\u05e4\u05d2\u05e2 \u05d0\u05d3\u05dd <\/span>,, is peculiar, and is literally, <i>I will not meet a man, <\/i>,which may be an inverted sentence put for, <i>a man shall not meet me, <\/i>,that is, no man shall prevent or hinder the effects of my wrath. Bishop Lowth renders it, \u201cNeither will I suffer a man to intercede with me.\u201d <\/p>,",
