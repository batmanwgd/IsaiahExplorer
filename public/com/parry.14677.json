Because war has claimed the lives of many of the men of Jerusalem (identified in 3:25), the ratio of men to women is unequal. Thus <i>seven women<\/i> will take hold of one man. The number <i>seven<\/i> may be literal or symbolic.<\/p> <p><i>eat our own bread\/wear our own apparel.<\/i> It is the husband's duty to provide for his bride (<a class=\"ref\">Ex. 21:10-11<\/a>), but in this prophecy Isaiah indicates that the seven women will provide for themselves.<\/p> <p><i>reproach.<\/i> This word means disgrace caused by the barrenness of the womb (<a class=\"ref\">Gen. 30:23; Luke 1:25<\/a>), a result of not having a husband.<\/p> ",
