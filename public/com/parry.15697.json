    "html": " <i>put thee away\/cast thee off.<\/i> Under Jewish law a husband separated from or divorced his wife by putting her away or casting her off. The Lord affirms that Israel had been <i>put away,<\/i> but it was Israel that turned away, not the Lord.<\/p> <p> <i>bill of your mother's divorcement.<\/i> According to the law of Moses, a man could not divorce his wife without presenting her with a legal bill<i> <\/i>of<i> <\/i>divorcement (<a class=\"ref\">Deut. 24:1-4<\/a>). At one point the Lord actually did separate himself from ancient Israel, as Jeremiah declared: \"When for all the causes whereby backsliding Israel committed adultery I had put her away, and given her a bill of divorce\" (<a class=\"ref\">Jer. 3:8<\/a>). Perhaps the Lord's reassurances here apply to latter-day Israel (54:6-8; see <a class=\"ref\">Hosea 2:4-9<\/a>). <\/p> <p><i>creditors&hellip;have I sold you.<\/i> It was the custom in ancient Israel for some creditors to take the children of their debtors and sell them as slaves for payment of an overdue debt (<a class=\"ref\">Ex. 21:7-8; Neh. 5:1-5<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\">Matt. 18:25<\/a>). But the Lord has no creditors\u2014 he is in debt to no one\u2014and he has not sold Israel into slavery. Ultimately, God and Israel are separated because of Israel's choices, not God's.<\/p> <p><i>sold yourselves\/put away.<\/i> The children of Israel have sold themselves into the bondage of sin. And the mother has been set aside, or divorced, because of unfaithfulness. Perhaps the children here represent the sons and daughters of the covenant, and perhaps the mother represents the nation of Israel as a whole.<\/p> ",
