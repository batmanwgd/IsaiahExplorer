    "html": "<p><em>For the stars of heaven \"Yea, the stars of heaven\"\u2014<\/em> The Hebrew poets, to express happiness, prosperity, the instauration and advancement of states, kingdoms, and potentates, make use of images taken from the most striking parts of nature, from the heavenly bodies, from the sun, moon, and stars: which they describe as shining with increased splendor, and never setting. The moon becomes like the meridian sun, and the sun's light is augmented sevenfold; (see <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MjQ0XQ==\">Isaiah 30:26<\/a>;); new heavens and a new earth are created, and a brighter age commences. On the contrary, the overflow and destruction of kingdoms is represented by opposite images. The stars are obscured, the moon withdraws her light, and the sun shines no more! The earth quakes, and the heavens tremble; and all things seem tending to their original chaos, See <a class=\"ref\">Joel 2:10; Joel 3:15, Joel 3:16; Amos 8:9; Matthew 24:29<\/a>; and De S. Poes. Herb. Prael. 6 et IX.<\/p> \n\n<p><em>And the moon shall not cause her light to shine\u2014<\/em> This in its farther reference may belong to the Jewish polity, both in Church and state, which should be totally eclipsed, and perhaps shine no more in its distinct state for ever.<\/p> ",
