    "html": " <p>Bel and Nebo, two chief pagan gods, are carried away on the backs of beasts into captivity (46:1-2). In other words, the idols are carried by those who made them (46:7). In contrast, Jehovah has carried his people on his own back \"from the womb,\" and he will continue to carry them \"even to your old age\" (46:3-4). While the idols have no power to deliver even themselves, Jehovah will deliver his people (46:2, 4). The idol worshipers may spend a fortune in making their images, but idols cannot help them in their time of \"trouble\" (46:6-7). Jehovah, who made us (46:4), will help us through every difficulty (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 3:8<\/a>). <\/p> <blockquote> <i>Bel<\/i> boweth down,     <br><i>Nebo<\/i> stoopeth,     <br>their idols were <i>upon the beasts,<\/i>     <br>and <i>upon the cattle:<\/i>     <br>your <i>carriages<\/i> were heavy laden;     <br><i>they<\/i> are a burden to the weary beast. (46:1)     <br>They <i>stoop,<\/i>     <br>they <i>bow down<\/i> together;     <br><i>they<\/i> could not deliver the burden,     <br>but <i>themselves<\/i> are gone into captivity. (46:2)     <br>Hearken unto me, O <i>house of Jacob,<\/i>     <br>and all the remnant of the <i>house of Israel,<\/i>     <br>which are <i>borne<\/i> by me from the belly,     <br>which are <i>carried<\/i> from the womb: (46:3)     <br>And even to your <i>old age<\/i> I am he;     <br>and even to [<i>grey<\/i>] <i> hairs<\/i> will I carry you:     <br><i>I <\/i> <u>have made<\/u>,     <br>and<i> I <\/i> <u>will bear<\/u>;     <br>even <i>I <\/i> <u>will carry<\/u>,     <br>and <u>will deliver<\/u> you. (46:4)     <br>To whom will ye <i>liken<\/i> me, and make me equal,     <br>and <i>compare<\/i> me, that we may be like? (46:5)     <br>They <i>lavish<\/i> <i>gold<\/i> out of the bag,     <br>and <i>weigh<\/i> <i>silver<\/i> in the balance,     <br>and <i>hire<\/i> a goldsmith;     <br>and he <i>maketh<\/i> it a god:     <br>they <i>fall down,<\/i>     <br>yea, they <i>worship.<\/i> (46:6)     <br><i>They<\/i> bear him upon the shoulder,     <br><i>they<\/i> carry him,     <br>and <i>set<\/i> him in his place,     <br>and he <i>standeth;<\/i> from his place shall he not remove:     <br>yea, one shall <i>cry unto him,<\/i>     <br>yet can <i>he not answer,<\/i> nor save him out of his trouble.
