But how could a blind and deaf messenger, like the actual Israel, do his work effectually? (<a class=\"ref\">Psalms 123:2<\/a>).<\/p>\n <p>As he that is perfect.\u2014Strictly speaking, the devoted, or surrendered one. The Hebrew meshullam is interesting, as connected with the modern Moslem and Islam, the man resigned to the will of God. The frequent use of this, or a cognate form, as a proper name after the exile (<a class=\"ref\">1 Chronicles 9:21; Ezra 8:6; Ezra 10:15; Nehemiah 3:4<\/a>) may (on either assumption as to the date of 2 Isaiah) be connected with it by some link of causation. Other meanings given to it have been \u201cperfect\u201d as in the Authorised Version, \u201cconfident,\u201d \u201crecompensed,\u201d \u201cmeritorious.\u201d<\/p>",
