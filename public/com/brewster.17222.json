    "html": "<p><b>(<a class=\"ref\">Mosiah 14:4<\/a>).<\/b>\"<i>We did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.<\/i>\" Little did we realize in premortal councils how much Jesus was offering when He volunteered to be our Savior. No wonder a modern-day apostle, Elder Neal A. Maxwell, has observed: \"Never has anyone offered so much to so many in so few words as did Jesus when He said, 'Here am I, send me.' [<a class=\"ref\">Abraham 3:27<\/a>.]\" (EAIA, 115.)<\/p>     <p>We loved and esteemed Him for His selfless sacrifice, knowing He was the key to our eternal salvation. For without His freewill and sinless offering, we would never break the bonds that would hold us captive to death and hell. (<a class=\"ref\">2 Nephi 9<\/a>.) No wonder we \"shouted for joy\" (<a class=\"ref\">Job 38:4-7<\/a>) when the plan of God was announced and Jesus was foreordained to be our Redeemer. (<a class=\"ref\">Moses 4:1-4; Abraham 3:22-28<\/a>.) Yet, as He suffered through those torturous hours inGethsemane, how all heaven must have wept in knowing of His agony.<\/p>     <p>Was He \"smitten of God\"? Not in the sense that His Father was meting out some kind of punishment. Yet the great Elohim knew the agony to which His Only Begotten would be subjected as He fulfilled His foreordained assignment. Of necessity, the Father of us all had to deny or to turn a deaf ear to the agonizing plea, \"O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me.\" According to President Brigham Young, the total withdrawal of the Father's spirit in Gethsemane precipitated the sweating of blood. (JD 3:206.)<\/p>     <p>Some commentaries have suggested that the reference to Christ's being smitten of God could apply to His seemingly forsaken condition on the cross. However, the author believes the above explanation to be more plausible.<\/p>",
