Then, even though you may not be of the covenant race (\"son of the stranger\"), and though you once may have been excluded (\"eunuch,\" representing those not allowed an inheritance under the law of Moses), you may receive the full blessings of the temple (\"in mine house\") and of exaltation (\"an everlasting name\") (56:3, 5). \"All people\" who come unto Christ will enjoy temple blessings (56:7).<\/p> <p>A theme repeated in this passage is the temple: \"mine house\" and \"within my walls\" (56:5) and \"my holy mountain,\" \"my house of prayer,\" \"mine altar,\" \"mine house,\" and \"an house of prayer\" (55:7).<\/p> <blockquote> Thus saith the Lord,     <br><i>Keep <\/i>ye<i> <\/i><u>judgment<\/u>,     <br>and <i>do <\/i><u>justice<\/u>:     <br>for <i>my salvation <\/i>is <u>near to come<\/u>,     <br>and <i>my righteousness<\/i> <u>to be revealed<\/u>.
