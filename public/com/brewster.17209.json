    "html": "<p><b>(<a class=\"ref\">3 Nephi 20:43<\/a>).<\/b>\"<i>My servant.<\/i>\" Victor Ludlow suggests at least four possibilities for the identity of this servant.<\/p>     <p>1. It could \"refer to Israel as a whole.\"<\/p>     <p>2. It could be \"the same servant described throughout <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 53<\/a>. If so, these verses describe Christ, his great works, and the persecutions and suffering he endured.\"<\/p>     <p>3. It could refer to Joseph Smith, the prophet of the restoration: \"As the Savior comments upon these verses later in <a class=\"ref\">3 Nephi 21:7-11<\/a>, it appears obvious that he is not talking about himself, but about his servant.\"<\/p>     <p>4. It could have reference to \"another modern prophet.\" Dr. Ludlow makes a strong case for President Spencer W. Kimball, who was the prophet when the commentary was written. However, he concludes by stating: \"Isaiah could be describing any or all of these people. If this prophecy deals with one particular person, the servant might not yet have fulfilled his role. Some future prophet might be the servant who will perform this great work.\" (IPSP, 438-41.)<\/p>     <p>Most commentaries identify the servant in this verse as Christ. Certainly none were more \"prudent\" (sound in judgment and circumspect in conduct) than was the Perfect One. Following His atonement, He was exalted to His place alongside the Eternal Father.<\/p>",
