    "html": "<p> This self-exaltation was a foolish sin. <em> \u201cDare the axe boast itself against him that heweth therewith, or the saw magnify itself against him that useth it? As if a staff were to swing those that lift it up, as if a stick should lift up not-wood!\u201d<\/em> \u201c<em> Not-wood<\/em> \u201d is to be taken as one word, as in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MjU5XQ==\">Isaiah 31:8<\/a>. A stick is wood, and nothing more; in itself it is an absolutely motionless thing. A man is \u201c<em> not-wood<\/em> ,\u201d an incomparably higher, living being. As there must be \u201cnot-wood\u201d to lay hold of wood, so, wherever a man performs extraordinary deeds, there is always a superhuman cause behind, viz., God Himself, who bears the same relation to the man as the man to the wood. The boasting of the Assyrian was like the bragging of an instrument, such as an axe, a saw, or a stick, against the person using it. The verb <em> he\u0304n\u0131\u0304ph <\/em> is applied both to saw and stick, indicating the oscillating movements of a measured and more or less obvious character. The plural, \u201cthose that lift it up,\u201d points to the fact that by Him who lifts up the stock, Jehovah, the cause of all causes, and power of all powers, is intended.<\/p>",
