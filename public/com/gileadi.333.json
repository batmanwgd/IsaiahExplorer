Synonymously paralleled with Mount Zion, Ariel here denotes the righteous of Jehovah&rsquo;s people or Jehovah&rsquo;s valiant ones. In other words, the curses of his covenant, as represented by hunger and thirst, now come upon those who violate the rights of Jehovah&rsquo;s elect. The nations who labor under the dream or delusion conjured up in the night&mdash;Jehovah&rsquo;s Day of Judgment&mdash;that they can destroy his righteous people are in the end themselves destroyed (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzk5NiI6M30=\">Isaiah 17:12-14<\/a>).<\/p> ",
