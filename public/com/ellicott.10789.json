In the reign of Ahaz (perhaps the prophet, editing in his old age, thought also of that of Manasseh) there was not even the homage which vice pays to virtue by feigning a virtue which it has not. Men fell into an utter shamelessness, like that of the cities of the plain (<a class=\"ref\">Genesis 19:5<\/a>), generally in the luxury and profligacy of their lives (<a class=\"ref\">Ezekiel 16:49<\/a>), perhaps also with a more definite and horrible resemblance (<a class=\"ref\">1 Kings 14:24; 1 Kings 15:12; 2 Kings 23:7<\/a>). <\/p> \n <p>Woe unto their soul!\u2014In the midst of the confusions of the times the prophet is bidden to proclaim that the law of a righteous retribution would be seen working even there. <\/p> ",
