    "html": " <p>,(23) I will also make it a possession for the bittern . . .\u2014Naturalists are not agreed as to the meaning of the noun. In the LXX. and Vulgate it appears as \u201chedgehog,\u201d or \u201cporcupine,\u201d and the \u201ctortoise,\u201d \u201cbeaver,\u201d \u201cotter,\u201d and \u201cowl\u201d have all been suggested by scholars. Its conjunction with \u201cpelican in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MzE1XQ==\">Isaiah 34:11<\/a>, and <a class=\"ref\">Zephaniah 2:14<\/a>, and with\u201d pools of water \u201chere, is in favour of some kind of water-fowl. The \u201chedgehog\u201d frequents dry places, and not marshes, and does not roost, as in <a class=\"ref\">Zephaniah 2:14<\/a>, on the capitals of ruined columns. On the whole, therefore, \u201cbittern\u201d (Botaurus stellaris) may as well stand. <\/p>\n <p>Pools of water.\u2014These were the natural result of the breaking up of the canals, sluices, reservoirs, which had kept the overflow of the Euphrates within bounds (Diod. Sic., ii. 7). <\/p>\n <p>I will sweep it with the besom of destruction . . .\u2014The phrase has its parallel in the \u201csieve of vanity,\u201d in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MjQ2XQ==\">Isaiah 30:28<\/a>. (Comp. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MzE1XQ==\">Isaiah 34:11<\/a>) The force of the image must not be lost sight of Babylon is to be swept away as men sweep away some foul rubbish from their house. The world is cleaner for its destruction. The solemn doom closes the \u201cburden\u201d of Babylon. <\/p>",
