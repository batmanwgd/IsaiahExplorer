    "html": "<p><b>(<a class=\"ref\">3 Nephi 22:1<\/a>).<\/b>\"<i>Children of the desolate.<\/i>\" There are several possible interpretations of this phrase, according to LDS scholars. Sidney Sperry suggested the phrase means \"Zion in her desolate, barren state.\" (BMC, 413.) Monte Nyman opined that they \"represent the large number of people from the tribes of Israel who will gather to Zion following the building of the New Jerusalem.\" (GAWI, 211.) A trio of commentators identify them as \"scattered Israel, those who for generations have lived without the light of the gospel, who have not been fruitful in the faith of their fathers.\" (DCBM 4:155.)Victor Ludlow, following the text of modern Biblical translations, identified <i>desolate<\/i> as a modifier of <i>woman:<\/i>\"many children have been born to the'desolate' or forsaken woman.\" He then added this com-mentary:<\/p>     <p>\"The desolate woman and her relationship to the [married] wife can be understood in two ways: (1) The desolate woman represents the Gentiles, and the wife Israel; thus the Gentiles will bring forth greater spiritual fruits than Israel has delivered; (2) the desolate woman is Israel in her scattered condition, while the wife is those people remaining in the Holy Land. Thus Israel will bring forth more children (both physically and spiritually) outside the land of her original inheritance than in it. (See <a class=\"ref\">Gal. 4:22-31; Rev. 12:1-6<\/a>.) In either case, Isaiah uses these images to symbolize the relationship of the Lord to Israel; those who join with covenant Israel are the children of that relationship.\" (IPSP, 459.)<\/p>",
