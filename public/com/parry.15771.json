    "html": " <p>This passage is an invitation for Zion to rejoice. Zion, who has heretofore not brought forth the desired children (54:1), will nevertheless have children \"on the right hand and on the left\" (54:3). The children are those who have gathered to the family of Christ as members of the Church. No longer will all the righteous fit in the existing \"habitations\" of Zion, so her tent will need to be enlarged (54:2). They will also \"inherit the [lands of the] Gentiles\" (54:3), and stakes of Zion will be established and strengthened (54:2).<\/p> <p> The resurrected Jesus quoted this chapter during his visit to the Nephites, telling them it would come to pass after the work of the Father had commenced \"among all nations\" (<a class=\"ref\">3 Ne. 21:28<\/a>). In <a class=\"ref\">3 Ne. 20-21<\/a> Jesus told the Nephites some of the things that would transpire before the events recorded in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isa. 54<\/a>. Among them were the following: the gospel would go forth to the Gentiles (20:27-28; 21:2), the Jews (20:29-31), the Lamanites (21:4-7), and the dispersed of Israel (20:13; 21:26-28); the remnants of Israel would gather to Zion (21:1); and the covenant people of the Lord would be restored to the lands of their inheritance (20:14, 22, 29, 33, 46; 21:26- 28).<\/p> <blockquote><i>Sing,<\/i> O barren, <u>thou that didst not bear<\/u>;     <br><i>break forth into singing, <\/i>and<i> cry aloud,<\/i> <u>thou that didst not travail with child<\/u>:     <br>for more are the <i>children <\/i>of the desolate     <br>than the <i>children <\/i>of the married wife, saith the Lord. (54:1)     <br><i>Enlarge<\/i> <u>the place of<\/u><i> <\/i>thy tent,     <br>and let them <i>stretch forth<\/i> <u>the curtains of [thy]<\/u> <u> habitations<\/u>:     <br>spare not, <i>lengthen <\/i><u>thy cords<\/u>,     <br>and <i>strengthen <\/i><u>thy stakes<\/u>; (54:2)     <br>For thou shalt break forth on the <i>right hand<\/i> and on the <i>left;<\/i>     <br>and <i>thy seed shall inherit<\/i> the Gentiles,     <br>and make the desolate cities to <i>be inhabited.<\/i> (54:3)<\/blockquote> ",
