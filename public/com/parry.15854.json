For those who become his sheep, he provides living water in times of spiritual drought. Bones were considered the gauge of the body's vitality\u2014they become dry and brittle with age and illness but are moist and fresh with youth, health, and vigor (<a class=\"ref\">Job 21:24<\/a>). Bones that are made fat are renewed and made strong (66:14). <i>Make fat thy bones <\/i>may also refer to the resurrection.<\/p> <p><i>like a watered garden\/like a spring.<\/i> In a garden, the source of life, or water, comes from the outside. So shall it be with the righteous, who will receive sustenance from the Lord (51:3; <a class=\"ref\">Num. 24:5-6<\/a>). This situation contrasts with the curse in 1:30: \"For ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth, and as a garden that hath no water.\" With a spring, the waters come from within rather than from without. Jesus said, \"He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water\" (<a class=\"ref\">John 7:38<\/a>). In this dispensation the Lord promised, \"Unto him that keepeth my commandments I will give the mysteries of my kingdom, and the same shall be in him a well of living water, springing up unto everlasting life\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 63:23<\/a>). <\/p> ",
