    "html": "<p><a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTgzMDU=\">Isaiah 34:1<\/a>.<i>Come, <\/i>&c. \u2014 Here begins the third discourse of the third part of Isaiah\u2019s prophecies, and is continued to the end of the next chapter. It is connected with the preceding, and, Vitringa thinks, was delivered at the same time. It is divided into two sections: the first, contained in this chapter, exhibits judgments upon the adversaries of the church, and particularly upon Edom; the latter, in chap. 35., the jubilee of the church, and its happy, flourishing state. The events foretold are represented as being of the highest importance, and of universal concern, and all nations are called upon to attend to the declaration of them. Thus the prophet: <i>Come near, ye nations, and hear; hearken, ye people <\/i>\u2014 As if he had said, Let the people of all nations take notice of what I am about to say, as that wherein they are generally concerned, and by the consideration whereof they may be instructed and reformed, and so delivered from the calamity here denounced.<\/p>",
