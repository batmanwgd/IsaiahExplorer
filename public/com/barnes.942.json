    "html": "<p><em>Through the wrath<\/em>&mdash;By the anger, or indignation. This spreading desolation is the proof of his anger.<\/p><p><em>Is the land darkened<\/em>&mdash;The word used here&mdash;\u05e2\u05ea\u05dd \u201ba\u0302tham&mdash;occurs nowhere else. According to Gesenius, it is the same as \u05ea\u05de\u05dd ta\u0302mam to be or make complete; and hence means, &ldquo;in this place, to be consumed, or laid waste.&rdquo; Kimchi and Aben Ezra render it, &lsquo;The land is darkened.&rsquo; Septuagint, &Sigma;&upsilon;&gamma;&kappa;&epsilon;\u0301&kappa;&alpha;&upsilon;&tau;&alpha;&iota; Sungkekautai. Chaldee, \u05e6\u05e8\u05d5\u05db\u05ea cha\u0306ro\u0302kat&mdash;&lsquo;Is scorched.&rsquo; Jerome renders it, Conturbata est terra&mdash;&lsquo;The land is disturbed.&rsquo; The effect is doubtless such as ascending and spreading columns of fire and smoke would produce, and perhaps the general word desolate had better be used in translating the word.<\/p><p><em>And the people shall be as fuel of the fire<\/em>&mdash;This is an image of widespread ruin. The idea is, that they shall destroy one another as pieces of wood, when on fire, help to consume each other. The way in which it shall be done is stated more fully in the next verse.<\/p><p><em>No man shall spare his brother<\/em>&mdash;There shall be such a state of wickedness, that it shall lead to anarchy, and strife, and mutual destruction. The common ties of life shall be dissolved, and a man shall have no compassion on his own brother.<\/p>",
