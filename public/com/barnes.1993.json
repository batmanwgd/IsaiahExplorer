    "html": "<p><em>I have spread out my hands<\/em>&mdash;To spread out the hands is an action denoting invitation or entreaty <a class=\"ref\">Proverbs 1:24<\/a>. The sense is, that God had invited the Jews constantly to partake of his favors, but they had been rebellious, and had rejected his offers.<\/p><p><em>All the day<\/em>&mdash;I have not ceased to do it. The Chaldee renders this, &lsquo;I sent my prophets all the day to a rebellious people.&rsquo;<\/p><p><em>Unto a rebellious people<\/em>&mdash;(See the notes at <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 1:2<\/a>). Paul renders this, &Pi;&rho;&omicron;\u0300&sigmaf; &lambda;&alpha;&omicron;&nu; &alpha;\u0313&pi;&epsilon;&iota;&theta;&omicron;&upsilon;\u0342&nu;&tau;&alpha; &kappa;&alpha;&iota;\u0300 &alpha;\u0313&nu;&tau;&iota;&lambda;&epsilon;\u0301&gamma;&omicron;&nu;&tau;&alpha; Pros laon apeithounta kai antilegonta&mdash;&lsquo;Unto a disobedient and gainsaying people;&rsquo; but the sense is substantially preserved.<\/p><p><em>Which walketh<\/em>&mdash;In what way they did this, the prophet specifies in the following verse. This is the general reason why he had rejected them, and why he had resolved to make the offer of salvation to the Gentiles. This, at first, was a reason for the calamities which God had brought upon the nation in the suffering of the exile, but it also contains a general principle of which that was only one specimen. They had been rebellious, and God had brought this calamity upon them. It would be also true in future times, that he would reject them and offer salvation to the pagan world, and would be found by those who had never sought for him or called on his name.<\/p>",
