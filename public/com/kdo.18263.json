    "html": "<p> From west to east, i.e., in its whole extent, the land then presents the aspect of prosperous peace. <em> \u201cAnd the plain of Sharon becomes a meadow for flocks, and the valley of Achor a resting-place for oxen, for my people that asketh for me.\u201d<\/em> <em> Hassha\u0302ro\u0304n <\/em> (Sharon) is the plain of rich pasture-land which stretches along the coast of the Mediterranean from Yafo to the neighbourhood of Carmel. <em> \u201bEmeq <\/em> <em> \u201bAkho\u0304r <\/em> is a valley which became renowned through the stoning of Achan, in a range of hills running through the plain of Jericho (see Keil on <a class=\"ref\">Joshua 7:24<\/a>.). From the one to the other will the wealth in flocks extend, and in the one as well as in the other will that peace prevail which is now enjoyed by the people of Jehovah, who inquired for Him in the time of suffering, and therefore bear this name in truth. The idyllic picture of peace is thoroughly characteristic of Isaiah: see, for example, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MjgwXQ==\">Isaiah 32:20<\/a>; and for <em> re\u0304bhets <\/em> with <em> na\u0302veh <\/em> , compare <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MzI4XQ==\">Isaiah 35:7<\/a>.<\/p>",
