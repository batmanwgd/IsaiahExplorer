    "html": "<p><em>That he may know \"When he shall know\"<\/em> - \"Though so much has been written on this important passage, there is an obscurity and inconsequence which still attends it, in the general run of all the interpretations given to it by the most learned. And this obscure incoherence is given to it by the false rendering of a Hebrew particle, viz., <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05dc <\/span>  <span class=\"translit\">le<\/span>, in <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05dc\u05d3\u05e2\u05ea\u05d5 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">ledato<\/span> . This has been generally rendered, either 'that he may know,' or 'till he know.' It is capable of either version, without doubt; but either of these versions makes  <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 7:15<\/a>; incoherent and inconsistent with  <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 7:16<\/a>. For  <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 7:16<\/a>; plainly means to give a reason for the assertion in  <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 7:16<\/a>, because it is subjoined to it by the particle <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05db\u05d9 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">ki<\/span>, for. But it is no reason why a child should eat butter and honey till he was at an age to distinguish, that before that time the land of his nativity should be free from its enemies. This latter supposition indeed implies, what is inconsistent with the preceding assertion. For it implies, that in part of that time of the infancy spoken of the land should not be free from enemies, and consequently these species of delicate food could not be attainable, as they are in times of peace. The other version, 'that he may know,' has no meaning at all; for what sense is there in asserting, that a child shall eat butter and honey that he may know to refuse evil and choose good? Is there any such effect in this food? Surely not. Besides, the child is thus represented to eat those things, which only a state of peace produces, during its whole infancy, inconsistently with  <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 7:16<\/a>, which promises a relief from enemies only before the end of this infancy: implying plainly, that part of it would be passed in distressful times of war and siege, which was the state of things when the prophecy was delivered.<\/p>\n\n<p>\"But all these objections are cut off, and a clear, coherent sense is given to this passage, by giving another sense to the particle <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05dc <\/span>  <span class=\"translit\">le<\/span> . which never occurred to me till I saw it in Harmer's Observat., vol. i., p. 299. See how coherent the words of the prophet run, with how natural a connection one clause follows another, by properly rendering this one particle: 'Behold this Virgin shall conceive and bear a Son, and thou shalt call his name Immanuel; butter and honey, shall he eat, when he shall know to refuse evil, and choose good. For before this child shall know to refuse evil and choose good, the land shall be desolate, by whose two kings thou art distressed.' Thus  <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 7:16<\/a>; subjoins a plain reason why the child should eat butter and honey, the food of plentiful times, when he came to a distinguishing age; viz., because before that time the country of the two kings, who now distressed Judea, should be desolated; and so Judea should recover that plenty which attends peace. That this rendering, which gives perspicuity and rational connection to the passage, is according to the use of the Hebrew particle, is certain. Thus <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d1\u05e7\u05e8 \u05dc\u05e4\u05e0\u05d5\u05ea <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">liphnoth boker<\/span>, 'at the appearing of morning, or when morning appeared,'  <a class=\"ref\">Exodus 14:27<\/a>; <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d4\u05d0\u05db\u05dc \u05dc\u05e2\u05ea <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">leeth haochel<\/span>, 'at mealtime, or when it was time to eat,' <a href=\"\/\/www.studylight.org\/desk\/index.cgi?q1=Rth+2:14&t1=en_nas\" id=\"27\" class=\"stL\" target=\"_blank\">Rth 2:14<\/a>. In the same manner, <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05dc\u05d3\u05e2\u05ea\u05d5 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">ledato<\/span>, 'at his knowing, that is, when he knows.'<\/p>\n\n<p>\"Harmer (ibid.) has clearly shown that these articles of food are delicacies in the East, and, as such, denote a state of plenty. See also  <a class=\"ref\">Joshua 5:6<\/a>. They therefore naturally express the plenty of the country, as a mark of peace restored to it. Indeed, in  <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 7:22<\/a>; it expresses a plenty arising from the thinness of the people; but that it signifies,  <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 7:15<\/a>, a plenty arising from deliverance from war then present, is evident; because otherwise there is no expression of this deliverance. And that a deliverance was intended to be here expressed is plain, from calling the child which should be born Immanuel, God with us. It is plain, also, because it is before given to the prophet in charge to make a declaration of the deliverance,  <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 7:3-7<\/a>; and it is there made; and this prophecy must undoubtedly be conformable to that in this matter.\" - Dr. Jubb.<\/p>\n\n<p>The circumstance of the child's eating butter and honey is explained by Jarchi, as denoting a state of plenty: \"Butter and honey shall this child eat, because our land shall be full of all good.\" Comment in locum.

Who could this be, other than the heir of the throne of David; under which character a great and even a Divine person had been promised? No one of that age answered to this character except Hezekiah; but he was certainly born nine or ten years before the delivery of this prophecy. That this was so understood at that time is collected, I think, with great probability, from a passage of Micah, a prophet contemporary with Isaiah, but who began to prophesy after him; and who, as I have already observed, imitated him, and sometimes used his expressions. Micah, having delivered that remarkable prophecy which determines the place of the birth of Messiah, \"the Ruler of God's people, whose goings forth have been of old, from everlasting;\" that it should be Bethlehem Ephratah; adds immediately, that nevertheless, in the mean time, God would deliver his people into the hands of their enemies: \"He will give them up, till she, who is to bear a child, shall bring forth,\"  <a class=\"ref\">Micah 5:3<\/a>. This obviously and plainly refers to some known prophecy concerning a woman to bring forth a child; and seems much more properly applicable to this passage of Isaiah than to any others of the same prophet, to which some interpreters have applied it. St. Matthew, therefore, in applying this prophecy to the birth of Christ, does it, not merely in the way of accommodating the words of the prophet to a suitable case not in the prophet's view, but takes it in its strictest, clearest, and most important sense; and applies it according to the original design and principal intention of the prophet. - L.<\/p>\n\n<p>After all this learned criticism, I think something is still wanting to diffuse the proper light over this important prophecy. On  <a class=\"ref\">Matthew 1:23<\/a>; I have given what I judge to be the true meaning and right application of the whole passage, as there quoted by the evangelist, the substance of which it will be necessary to repeat here: - <\/p>\n\n<p>At the time referred to, the kingdom of Judah, under the government of Ahaz, was reduced very low. Pekah, king of Israel, had slain in Judea one hundred and twenty thousand persons in one day; and carried away captives two hundred thousand, including women and children, together with much spoil. To add to their distress, Rezin, king of Syria, being confederate with Pekah, had taken Elath, a fortified city of Judah, and carried the inhabitants away captive to Damascus. In this critical conjuncture, need we wonder that Ahaz was afraid that the enemies who were now united against him must prevail, destroy Jerusalem, end the kingdom of Judah, and annihilate the family of David? To meet and remove this fear, apparently well grounded, Isaiah is sent from the Lord to Ahaz, swallowed up now both by sorrow and by unbelief, in order to assure him that the counsels of his enemies should not stand; and that they should be utterly discomfited. To encourage Ahaz, he commands him to ask a sign or miracle, which should be a pledge in hand, that God should, in due time, fulfill the predictions of his servant, as related in the context. On Ahaz humbly refusing to ask any sign, it is immediately added, \"Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive and bear a son; and shall call his name Immanuel. Butter and honey shall he eat,\" etc. Both the Divine and human nature of our Lord, as well as the miraculous conception, appear to be pointed out in the prophecy quoted here by the evangelist: He shall be called <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05e2\u05de\u05e0\u05d5\u05d0\u05dc <\/span>  <span class=\"translit\">Immanuel<\/span> ; literally, The Strong God with Us: similar to those words in the New Testament: The word which was God - was made flesh, and dwelt among us, full of grace and truth;  <a class=\"ref\">John 1:1,  John 1:14<\/a>. And God was manifested in the flesh,  <a class=\"ref\">1 Timothy 3:16<\/a>. So that we are to understand God with us to imply, God incarnated - God in human nature. This seems farther evident from the words of the prophet,  <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 7:15<\/a>; : Butter and honey shall he eat - he shall be truly man - grow up and be nourished in a human natural way; which refers to his being With Us, i.e., incarnated. To which the prophet adds, That he may know to refuse the evil, and choose the good; or rather, According to his knowledge, <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05dc\u05d3\u05e2\u05ea\u05d5 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">ledato<\/span>, reprobating the evil, and choosing the good; this refers to him as God, and is the same idea given by this prophet, chap.  <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 53:11<\/a>; : By (or in) his knowledge, <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d1\u05d3\u05e2\u05ea\u05d5 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">bedato<\/span>, (the knowledge of Christ crucified), shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear their offenses. Now this union of the Divine and human nature is termed a sign or miracle, <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d0\u05d5\u05ea <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">oth<\/span>, i.e., something which exceeds the power of nature to produce. And this miraculous union was to be brought about in a miraculous way: Behold, a Virgin shall conceive: the word is very emphatic, <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d4\u05e2\u05dc\u05de\u05d4 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">haalmah<\/span>, The virgin; the only one that ever was, or ever shall be, a mother in this way. But the Jews, and some called Christians, who have espoused their desperate cause, assert that \"the word <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05e2\u05dc\u05de\u05d4 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">almah<\/span>  does not signify a Virgin only; for it is applied  <a class=\"ref\">Proverbs 30:19<\/a>; to signify a young married woman.\" I answer, that this latter text is no proof of the contrary doctrine: the words <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d1\u05e2\u05dc\u05de\u05d4 \u05d2\u05d1\u05e8 \u05d3\u05e8\u05da <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">derech geber bealmah<\/span>, the way of a man with a maid, cannot be proved to mean that for which it is produced. Besides, one of De Rossi's MSS. reads <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d1\u05e2\u05dc\u05de\u05d9\u05d5 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">bealmaiv<\/span>, the way of a strong or stout man (<span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d2\u05d1\u05e8 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">geber<\/span> ) In His Youth; and in this reading the Syriac, Septuagint, Vulgate, and Arabic agree; which are followed by the first version in the English language, as it stands in a MS. in my own possession: the weie of a man in his waxing youth: so that this place, the only one that can with any probability of success be produced, were the interpretation contended for correct, which I am by no means disposed to admit, proves nothing. Besides, the consent of so many versions in the opposite meaning deprives it of much of its influence in this question.<\/p>\n\n<p>The word <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05e2\u05dc\u05de\u05d4 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">almah<\/span>, comes from <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05e2\u05dc\u05dd <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">alam<\/span>, to lie hid, be concealed: and we are told, that \"virgins were so called, because they were concealed or closely kept up in their father's houses till the time of their marriage.\" This is not correct: see the case of Rebecca,  <a class=\"ref\">Genesis 24:43<\/a>; (note), and my note there; that of Rachel,  <a class=\"ref\">Genesis 29:6-9<\/a>; (note), and the note there also; and see the case of Miriam, the sister of Moses,  <a class=\"ref\">Exodus 2:8<\/a>, and also the Chaldee paraphrase on  <a class=\"ref\">Lamentations 1:4<\/a>, where the virgins are represented as going out in the dance. And see also the whole history of Ruth. This being concealed or kept at home, on which so much stress is laid, is purely fanciful; for we find that young unmarried women drew water, kept sheep, gleaned publicly in the fields, etc., etc., and the same works they perform among the Turcomans to the present day. This reason, therefore, does not account for the radical meaning of the word; and we must seek it elsewhere. Another well-known and often-used root in the Hebrew tongue will cast light on this subject. This is <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d2\u05dc\u05d4 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">galah<\/span>, which signifies to reveal, make manifest, or uncover; and is often applied to matrimonial connections in different parts of the Mosaic law: <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05e2\u05dc\u05dd <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">alam<\/span>, therefore, may be considered as implying the concealment of the virgin, as such, till lawful, marriage had taken place. A virgin was not called <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05e2\u05dc\u05de\u05d4 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">almah<\/span>, because she was concealed by being kept at home in her father's house, which is not true; but, literally and physically, because as a woman she had not been uncovered - she had not known man. This fully applies to the blessed virgin, see  <a class=\"ref\">Luke 1:34<\/a>. \"How can this be, seeing I know no man?\" And this text throws much light on the subject before us. This also is in perfect agreement with the ancient prophecy, \"The seed of the woman shall bruise the head of the serpent,\"  <a class=\"ref\">Genesis 3:15<\/a>; for the person who was to destroy the work of the devil was to be the progeny of the woman, without any concurrence of the man. And hence the text in Genesis speaks as fully of the virgin state of the person from whom Christ, according to the flesh, should come, as that in the prophet, or this in the evangelist. According to the original promise there was to be a seed, a human being, who should destroy sin: but this seed or human being, must come from the woman Alone; and no woman Alone could produce such a human being without being a virgin. Hence, A virgin shall bear a son, is the very spirit and meaning of the original text, independently of the illustration given by the prophet; and the fact recorded by the evangelist is the proof of the whole. But how could that be a sign to Ahaz which was to take place so many hundreds of years after? I answer, the meaning of the prophet is plain: not only Rezin and Pekah should be unsuccessful against Jerusalem at that time, which was the fact; but Jerusalem, Judea, and the house of David should be both preserved, notwithstanding their depressed state, and the multitude of their adversaries, till the time should come when a Virgin should bear a son. This is a most remarkable circumstance the house of David could never fail, till a virgin should conceive and bear a son - nor did it: but when that incredible and miraculous fact did take place, the kingdom and house of David became extinct! This is an irrefragable confutation of every argument a Jew can offer in vindication of his opposition to the Gospel of Christ. Either the prophecy in Isaiah has been fulfilled, or the kingdom and house of David are yet standing. But the kingdom of David, we know, is destroyed: and where is the man, Jew or Gentile, that can show us a single descendant of David on the face of the earth? The prophecy could not fail: the kingdom and house of David have failed; the virgin, therefore, must have brought forth her son, and this son is Jesus, the Christ. Thus Moses, Isaiah, and Matthew concur; and facts the most unequivocal have confirmed the whole! Behold the wisdom and providence of God!<\/p>\n\n<p>Notwithstanding what has been said above, it may be asked, In what sense could this name, Immanuel, be applied to Jesus Christ, if he be not truly and properly God? Could the Spirit of truth ever design that Christians should receive him as an angel or a mere man; and yet, in the very beginning of the Gospel history, apply a character to him which belongs only to the most high God? Surely no. In what sense, then, is Christ God with Us? Jesus is called Immanuel, or God with us, in his incarnation; God united to our nature; God with man, God in man; God with us, by his continual protection; God with us, by the influences of his Holy Spirit, in the holy sacrament, in the preaching of his word, in private prayer. And God with us, through every action of our life, that we begin, continue, and end in his name. He is God with us, to comfort, enlighten, protect, and defend us, in every time of temptation and trial, in the hour of death, in the day of judgment; and God with us and in us, and we with and in him, to all eternity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The Lord shall bring \"But Jehovah will bring\"\u2014<\/em>Houbigant reads <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d5\u05d1\u05d9\u05d0 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">vaiyabi<\/span>, from the Septuagint, <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03b1 \u03b5\u03c0\u03b1\u03be\u03b5\u03b9 \u03bf\u0314 \u0398\u03b5\u03bf\u03c2<\/span>, to mark the transition to a new subject.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Even the king of Assyria\u2014<\/em>Houbigant supposes these words to have been a marginal gloss, brought into the text by mistake; and so likewise Archbishop Secker.
