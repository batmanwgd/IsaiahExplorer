    "html": "          <p>Again Isaiah refers to \"the new heavens and the new earth,\" but this time he points to their eternal nature as an illustration. The names of the children of Israel who have gathered and their seed will also be eternal. The scriptures speak of two different creations of a new heaven and a new earth. One is a renewal of the paradisiacal glory of the earth during the Millennium, spoken of in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4OTE1XQ==\">Isaiah 65:17<\/a> (see the note on that verse); the other is the bringing forth of the resurrected, celestialized earth. This verse may refer to either or both of these because of the eternal status mentioned. Scriptures which speak of the resurrected earth are <a class=\"ref\">Rev. 21:1<\/a> and <a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 29:23<\/a>.<\/p>     <p>Worship among the children of Israel during the Millennium will be as constant as the eternal nature of the earth, their seed, and their names.<\/p>     ",
