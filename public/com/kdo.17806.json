    "html": "<p> The Oracle Concerning Damascus and Israel - <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzk4NSI6MTR9\">Isaiah 17:1-14<\/a><\/p><p> From the Philistines on the west, and the Moabites on the east, the prophecy relating to the neighbouring nations now turns, without any chronological order, to the people of Damascene Syria on the north. The curse pronounced on them, however, falls upon the kingdom of Israel also, because it has allied itself with heathen Damascus, in opposition to its own brother tribe to the south, as well as to the Davidic government; and by this unnatural alliance with a <em> za\u0302r <\/em> , or stranger, had become a <em> za\u0302r <\/em> itself. From the period of Hezekiah's reign, to which the <em> massa <\/em> <em> Moab<\/em> belongs, at least so far as its epilogue is concerned, we are here carried back to the reign of Ahaz, and indeed far beyond \u201cthe year that Ahaz died\u201d (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3OTU3XQ==\">Isaiah 14:28<\/a>), to the very border of the reigns of Jotham and Ahaz - namely, to the time when the league for the destruction of Judah had only just been concluded. At the time when Isaiah incorporated this oracle in his collection, the threats against the kingdoms of Damascus and Israel had long been fulfilled. Assyria had punished both of them. And Assyria itself had also been punished, as the fourth turn in the oracle indicates. Consequently the oracle stands here as a memorial of the truthfulness of the prophecy; and it answers a further purpose still, viz., to furnish a rich prophetic consolation for the church of all times, when persecuted by the world, and sighing under the oppression of the kingdom of the world.<\/p>",
