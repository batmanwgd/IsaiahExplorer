Jehovah pronounces a &ldquo;woe&rdquo; or covenant curse on those who trust in an arm of flesh&mdash;that is, in man instead of in him. The terms &ldquo;rebellious sons&rdquo; designate those who renege on their covenant relationship with Jehovah (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxNzY1N10seyIxODg3NSI6M31d\">v 9; Isaiah 1:2; 63:8-10<\/a>) by making human contingency &ldquo;plans&rdquo; or &ldquo;schemes&rdquo; (<em>&lsquo;esa<\/em>) and &ldquo;alliances&rdquo; or &ldquo;agreements&rdquo; (<em>masseka<\/em>), only adding sin to sin (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODE4MF0seyIxODIwOSI6Mn1d\">Isaiah 28:15; 29:15-16<\/a>). Their first sin is to backslide from Jehovah; their second is to supplant him with themselves.<\/p>",
