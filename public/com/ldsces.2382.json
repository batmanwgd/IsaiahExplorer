    "html": " <p>Isaiah was caught up in the majesty of his latter-day prophecy; however, at this point he digressed to expound upon the status of Israel between the day of his prophecy and the day of its fulfillment. He gave a clear reminder that all those, including wayward Israel, who pay homage at the feet of idols are deaf and blind to the message and light of the gospel (see <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODQ5OCI6Mn0=\">vv. 17&ndash;18<\/a>). The Prophet Joseph Smith clarified verses 19&ndash;22 as follows: <\/p> <p>&ldquo;For I will send my servant unto you who are blind; yea, a messenger to open the eyes of the blind, and unstop the ears of the deaf; <\/p> <p>&ldquo;And they shall be made perfect notwithstanding their blindness, if they will hearken unto the messenger, the Lord&rsquo;s servant. <\/p> <p>&ldquo;Thou art a people, seeing many things, but thou observest not; opening the ears to hear, but thou hearest not. <\/p> <p>&ldquo;The Lord is not well pleased with such a people, but for his righteousness&rsquo; sake he will magnify the law and make it honorable. <\/p> <p>&ldquo;Thou art a people robbed and spoiled; thine enemies, all of them, have snared thee in holes, and they have hid thee in prison houses; they have taken thee for a prey, and none delivereth; for a spoil, and none saith, Restore.&rdquo; (<a class=\"ref\">JST, Isaiah 42:19&ndash;23<\/a>.) <\/p> <p>Clearly, it is not the servant who is blind, but scattered Israel, who have adopted the idols of their neighbors. <\/p> <p class=\"cite\"> LDS Church Educational System Old Testament Student Manual, 1 Kings&ndash;Malachi, Religion 302, Chapter 16, Item 21 <\/p> ",
