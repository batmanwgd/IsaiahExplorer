    "html": " <i>Ye are my witnesses. <\/i>This phrase is repeated in 43:12. The children of Israel were chosen to be witnesses of Jehovah and bear testimony of him to the world. Sometimes Israel has failed to do so, because her people were spiritually blind. In our own day we, the house of Israel (especially Ephraim and Manasseh), are instructed to bear witness of our God, as modern-day prophets have explained. <\/p> <p><i>know and believe me\/understand. <\/i>We are told to seek knowledge of the Lord's nature and character so we are able to understand who he is and can bear a stronger witness of him (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 19:23<\/a>). <\/p> <p><i>I am he. <\/i>This clear statement answers the question asked in 43:9: \"Who among them can declare this?\" The expression also recalls Jehovah's title\u2014<i>I Am <\/i>(Ex. 3:14).<\/p> <p><i>before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me. <\/i>In Isaiah's great discussion of false gods and idols (chapters 40-46), he assures both ancient and modern Israel that Jehovah is God.<\/p> ",
