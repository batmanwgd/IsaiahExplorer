Similar to Syria in its destruction (\"in that day it shall come to pass\"), Israel, in all its glory and prosperity, will become as a shadow\u2014thin and afflicted. Unlike Syria, however, which would be afflicted both body and soul (annihilated from the earth), Israel's spirit would be left intact, eventually enabling a remnant to return to God with full strength.<\/p> ",
