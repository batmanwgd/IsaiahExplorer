    "html": "<p><em>And, behold... a chariot of men<\/em>&mdash;This place shows that the word &lsquo;chariot&rsquo; (\u05e8\u05db\u05d1 rekeb) may denote something else than a wagon or carriage, as a chariot drawn by men cannot be intended. The sense can be expressed, perhaps, by the word &ldquo;riding,&rdquo; &lsquo;I see a riding of men approach;&rsquo; that is, I see &ldquo;cavalry&rdquo; drawing near, or men riding and hastening to the battle.<\/p><p><em>With a couple of horsemen<\/em>&mdash;The word &lsquo;with&rsquo; is not in the Hebrew. The meaning is, &lsquo;I see a riding of men, or cavalry; and they come in pairs, or two abreast.&rsquo; A part of the sentence is to be supplied from <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 21:7<\/a>. He saw not only horsemen, but riders on donkeys and camels.<\/p><p><em>And he answered<\/em>&mdash;That is, the watchman answered. The word &lsquo;answer,&rsquo; in the Scriptures, means often merely to commence a discourse after an interval; to begin to speak <a class=\"ref\">Job 3:2; Daniel 2:26; Acts 5:8<\/a>.<\/p><p><em>Babylon is fallen<\/em>&mdash;That is, her ruin is certain. Such a mighty army is drawing near, and they approach so well prepared for battle, that the ruin of Babylon is inevitable. The &ldquo;repetition&rdquo; of this declaration that &lsquo;Babylon is fallen,&rsquo; denotes emphasis and certainty. Compare <a class=\"ref\">Psalm 92:9<\/a>:<\/p><p>For lo, thine enemies, O Lord,<\/p><p>For lo, thine enemies shall perish.<\/p>",
