The same practice existed in the Greek and Roman cultures. The drunken partygoers in Samaria wear these wreaths on their heads as they try to forget the terror facing them. At the same time the battlements of the city sitting on its hilltop at the \u201chead\u201d of the \u201cvalley\u201d (28:1, 4) give it the appearance of one of these wreaths. But Isaiah sees a day when all these wreaths, both the real and the symbolic, will be thrown to the ground and trampled. The \u201cpride\u201d of the northern kingdom is going to be snatched up like a ripe \u201cfig\u201d (28:4).<\/p>     <p>\u2003In contrast, there is another \u201cwreath,\u201d the Lord himself (28:5). He will be the source of beauty and glory for those who have abandoned their own pride in glad submission to him. He will give \u201cjustice\u201d to the judges and \u201cstrength\u201d to the soldiers (28:6). The mention of \u201ccrown\u201d in verse 5 puts the issue in a clear light: Who is the King, the drunken political leaders or \u201cthe LORD Almighty?\u201d<\/p>     ",
