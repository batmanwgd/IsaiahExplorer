The only touch of definite localisation is found in the mention of Kedar. (See Note on <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MDUyXQ==\">Isaiah 21:16<\/a>.) Starting from this, the other terms gain a more defined significance. The proclamation seems to be addressed to the nations of the Eastern, not the Western world, as if to the ships that sailed from Elath or Ezion-geber down the Elanitic Gulf. The rock, or Sela (see <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3OTcxXQ==\">Isaiah 16:1<\/a>), is the Petra of Roman Idum\u00e6a; the ships are those that trade to Ophir or the land of Sinim. The cities and the nomad tribes are all invited to join in the hymn of praise, and it is to be echoed in the far-off \u201cislands,\u201d or coasts, of the Indian Ocean.<\/p>",
