    "html": " <p>, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODg2NSI6M30=\">Isaiah 62:10&ndash;12 <\/a>,rounds off <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODg1NiI6MTJ9\">ch. 62 <\/a>,by providing the answer to the prayer with which the chapter begins (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODU2XQ==\">v 1 <\/a>) and by bringing the naming theme to completion (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODY3XQ==\">v 12 <\/a>,cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODU3LDE4ODU5XQ==\">vv 2, 4 <\/a>). Steck (1989a, 374; 1991a, 143&ndash;66) accumulated arguments designed to prove that these three verses were added by a redactor to serve as the finale for his <em>Grossjesajabuch <\/em>: that is, a compilation consisting in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">40&ndash;55 + 60&ndash;62 <\/a>,+ the core of <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODg1NiI6MTJ9\">1&ndash;39 <\/a>. It was therefore necessary for him to demonstrate a lack of connection between <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODg2NSI6M30=\">vv 10&ndash;12 <\/a>,and <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODg2MyI6Mn0=\">vv 8&ndash;9 <\/a>,or <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODg1NiI6OX0=\">vv 1&ndash;9 <\/a>. But abrupt transitions are common throughout <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">40&ndash;66 <\/a>,and cannot be taken without further ado to indicate difference of authorship. While impressed by this same abrupt transition, Lau (1994, 108) chose the less radical option of designating <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODg2MyI6Mn0=\">vv 8&ndash;9 <\/a>,as an <em>Einschub <\/em>,(&ldquo;insertion&rdquo;), which at least had the advantage of bringing <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODY1XQ==\">v 10 <\/a>,into immediate connection with <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODYyXQ==\">v 7 <\/a>,, thereby making it abundantly clear to which gates the writer is referring. This may be a correct if unnecessary hypothesis, but there is no way of knowing for sure. <\/p> <p>Since we have seen that there is no good reason to suppose that <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODgyMyI6NDV9\">chs. 60&ndash;62 <\/a>,were originally in a different sequence, we can say that <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODg2NSI6M30=\">62:10&ndash;12 <\/a>,also concludes the Trito-Isaianic core (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">60&ndash;62 <\/a>), again by giving a more specific content to the opening phrase &ldquo;your light has come&rdquo; (<em>b\u0101\u02be \u02bf&ocirc;r\u0113k <\/em>,, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODIzXQ==\">60:1 <\/a>) by means of &ldquo;your salvation comes&rdquo; (<em>yi&scaron;\u02bf\u0113k b\u0101\u02be <\/em>,, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODY2XQ==\">62:11 <\/a>). The recapitulatory intent can be observed in other ways: the naming theme (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODM2XQ==\">60:14 <\/a>); redemption (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODM4XQ==\">60:16 <\/a>); salvation (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODU0LDE4ODU2XQ==\">61:10; 62:1 <\/a>); and the negating of negatives&mdash;&ldquo;there is no one passing by&rdquo; (<em>\u02be&ecirc;n \u02be\u014db\u0113r <\/em>,, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODM3XQ==\">60:15 <\/a>); &ldquo;pass through, pass through&rdquo; (<em>\u02bfibr&ucirc;, \u02bfibr&ucirc; <\/em>,, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODU2XQ==\">62:1 <\/a>). <\/p> <p>For the author of <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODgyMyI6NDV9\">chs. 60&ndash;62 <\/a>,, prophecy is the outcome of reflection on earlier prophecies, principally those contained in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">40&ndash;55 <\/a>,, and their adaptation to an evolving situation within the Judean community and in its relation to external forces. It is therefore not surprising that dependence on <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODQyMiI6MzMzfQ==\">chs. 40&ndash;55 <\/a>,is abundantly in evidence in this final recapitulation. Clearing the way and building up the highway take us back to the opening injunction: <\/p> <p>Clear in the wilderness <\/p> <p>a way for YHVH; <\/p> <p>level in the desert <\/p> <p>a highway for our God! (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDI0XQ==\">40:3 <\/a>) <\/p> <p>It is repeated again in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzgwXQ==\">57:14 <\/a>,, &ldquo;Build up, build up the road and clear the way,&rdquo; using the same language. That <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDI0XQ==\">40:3 <\/a>,has been adapted to a different situation is apparent from the fact that the way must now be prepared for the people. Furthermore, the key concept of &ldquo;the way&rdquo; (<em>derek <\/em>) is no longer limited to the way back from the Babylonian diaspora, or even to the diaspora in general; it has been transformed into an eschatological concept. The way that must be built up in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzgwXQ==\">57:14 <\/a>,represents a yet later stage, with strong ethnical implications, as is apparent from the pronouncement of the &ldquo;High and Holy One&rdquo; that follows (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODc4MCI6OH0=\">57:14&ndash;21 <\/a>). <\/p> <p>The signal (<em>n\u0113s <\/em>) raised over the nations of the world recalls <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NjU5XQ==\">49:22 <\/a>,, possibly also <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzg5NiI6Mn0=\">11:11&ndash;12 <\/a>,, where it serves to alert Gentiles to begin repatriating the Jewish diaspora. Neither the change from <em>\u02beel <\/em>,to <em>\u02beal <\/em>,nor the context justifies translating <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODY1XQ==\">v 10c <\/a>,&ldquo;Raise a signal <em>against <\/em>,the peoples&rdquo; (against Steck 1991a, 150&ndash;51). While the idea that the repatriation of Jews is a task assigned to Gentiles may not have been left behind, the signal now indicates the beginning of the great eschatological procession to the city and the temple. The proclamation of YHVH (with the verb <em>hi&scaron;m&icirc;a\u02bf <\/em>,, literally, &ldquo;cause to be heard&rdquo;) brings to a point of definition and closure many proclamations&mdash;of former things, new things, well-being, saving events&mdash;in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">40&ndash;55 <\/a>,(<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODQ5MCwxODUxOCwxODU0MiwxODU4MywxODYxOF0seyIxODYyMCI6Mn0sWzE4NzA0XV0=\">42:9; 43:12; 44:8; 45:21; 48:3, 5, 6; 52:7 <\/a>). <\/p> <p>The repetition verbatim of <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDMxXQ==\">40:10b <\/a>,in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODY2XQ==\">62:11c <\/a>,is the clearest pointer to the context in which this brief final utterance was meant to be understood: <\/p> <p>Climb to the top of a mountain, <\/p> <p>Zion, herald of good news; <\/p> <p>lift up your voice with power, <\/p> <p>Jerusalem, herald of good news; <\/p> <p>lift it up without fear. <\/p> <p>Say to the cities of Judah: <\/p> <p>&ldquo;See, here is your God!&rdquo; <\/p> <p>See, YHVH is coming with power, <\/p> <p>his strong arm affirms his rule; <\/p> <p>see, his reward is with him, <\/p> <p>his recompense precedes him. (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODQzMCI6Mn0=\">40:9&ndash;10 <\/a>) <\/p> <p>The repeated verse (emphasized) provides a clue to the direction in which the writer&rsquo;s thoughts were moving. There is an assurance that what was then spoken will be fulfilled, all obstacles notwithstanding. <\/p> <p>Taking in the entire corpus of <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODQyMiI6NTI2fQ==\">chs. 40&ndash;66 <\/a>,, this invitation to pass through the gates is the last of three similar passages that impose a certain structure, and therefore a certain overall meaning, on this segment of the book. The first concludes <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODQyMiI6MjE2fQ==\">chs. 40&ndash;48 <\/a>: <\/p> <p>Get out of Babylon, get away from the Chaldeans! <\/p> <p>With a shout of joy declare this out loud, <\/p> <p>send forth the message to the ends of the earth; <\/p> <p>tell them: &ldquo;YHVH has redeemed his servant Jacob!&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NjM1XQ==\">48:20 <\/a>) <\/p> <p>The similarity in form and wording with <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODg2NSI6M30=\">62:10&ndash;12 <\/a>,is apparent, but in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NjM1XQ==\">48:20 <\/a>,the message of good news is the limited salvation of return from the diaspora. The second passage concludes <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODYzOCI6NzJ9\">49:1&ndash;52:12 <\/a>,and immediately precedes the threnody on the suffering and death of the Servant: <\/p> <p>Away! away! Go thence, <\/p> <p>touch nothing unclean; <\/p> <p>purify yourselves as you depart, <\/p> <p>you who bear the vessels of YHVH; <\/p> <p>for you shall not leave in haste, <\/p> <p>nor shall you depart in flight, <\/p> <p>for YHVH goes on before you; <\/p> <p>the God of Israel is your rearguard. (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODcwOCI6Mn0=\">52:11&ndash;12 <\/a>) <\/p> <p>Return from the diaspora is still the theme, but it is overlaid with and transformed by other intimations. The way of return is now a processional way, and its goal is the sanctuary. <\/p> <p>In much the same way, &ldquo;the Song at the Papyrus Sea&rdquo; in <a class=\"ref\">Exod 15 <\/a>,re-presents the trek through the wilderness as a procession to &ldquo;the mountain of your possession,&rdquo; &ldquo;the place you have made your abode,&rdquo; &ldquo;the sanctuary your hands have established,&rdquo; where God&rsquo;s rule in the world will finally be realized: &ldquo;YHVH will reign forever and ever&rdquo; (<a class=\"ref\">Exod 15:17&ndash;18 <\/a>). Without giving up on the specific goals of return from the diaspora, temple worship, and land tenure, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODg2NSI6M30=\">62:10&ndash;12 <\/a>,therefore has broadened the understanding of &ldquo;the way&rdquo; (<em>derek <\/em>) by infusing it with the idea of spiritual and moral transformation, in keeping with the thrust of <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODc1NSI6MTkzfQ==\">chs. 56&ndash;66 <\/a>,as a whole. <\/p> <p>What is described in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODY1XQ==\">62:10 <\/a>,is analogous to a <em>parousia <\/em>,type-scene from the Hellenistic and Roman periods. The term <em>parousia <\/em>,, meaning &ldquo;presence&rdquo; and, by implication, &ldquo;advent&rdquo; leading to presence, was used of the visit of a ruler to a city or of a theophany, for example, of Dionysus, to an individual or group. The visit of the emperor to a provincial city was an extraordinary event, requiring careful preparation on the part of the citizens and calling for a delegation to meet the distinguished visitor, exchange gifts, and escort him back into the city. The gates mentioned here are therefore the city gates, and it may reasonably be surmised that those who are to pass through them in leaving the city are the prophetic acolytes who, earlier (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODYxXQ==\">v 6 <\/a>), had been stationed on the city wall. To this extent there is agreement with the Targumist, who identifies the hearers as prophets, though he sees them as passing in and out of the city gates. <\/p> <p>The task assigned to the prophetic discipleship, which follows a divine proclamation (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODY2XQ==\">11a <\/a>) and prepares for the <em>parousia <\/em>,, is set out in five imperatives. The disciples are to level the processional way (<em>pann&ucirc; <\/em>), build up the highway (<em>soll&ucirc; <\/em>), clear it of boulders (<em>saqq\u0115l&ucirc; <\/em>), raise a signal for proceedings to commence (<em>h\u0101r&icirc;m&ucirc; n\u0113s <\/em>), and explain the significance of the event to people in the city (<em>\u02beimr&ucirc; <\/em>). The parallelism with the prophetic plurality associated with an individual prophetic figure addressed at the beginning of <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODQyMiI6NTI2fQ==\">chs. 40&ndash;66 <\/a>,(<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODQyMiI6MTF9\">40:1&ndash;11 <\/a>) is unmistakable (see Volume 2, pp. 185&ndash;86) and is further reinforced by the verbatim repetition of <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDMxXQ==\">40:10 <\/a>: &ldquo;his reward is with him \/ his recompense precedes him.&rdquo; These terms&mdash; <em>\u015b\u0101kar, p\u0115\u02bfull&acirc; <\/em>&mdash;should not be taken literally, in the sense that Zion and its people had earned this salvation, that they were now being paid their wages. They connote rather the reversal of fortune bestowed as a gift, the gift of divine presence. If we take in the scene as a whole, we could read it as an eschatologized version of the processional hymns in which the gates of righteousness (in this instance, the temple gates) are addressed directly and through which a righteous people enter with thanksgiving (<a class=\"ref\">Pss 24:7&ndash;10; 100:4; 118:19&ndash;20 <\/a>). <\/p> <p>The passage ends with the bestowal of the new names promised in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODU3XQ==\">62:2b <\/a>. The honorific title <em>\u02bfam-haqq\u014dde&scaron; <\/em>,(&ldquo;the Holy People&rdquo;), elsewhere in Isaiah only in the community lament (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODg1XQ==\">63:18 <\/a>) but comparable to &ldquo;the holy seed&rdquo; (<em>zera\u02bf q\u014dde&scaron; <\/em>,, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzgzXQ==\">6:13 <\/a>), corresponds to <em>\u02bf&icirc;r haqq\u014dde&scaron; <\/em>,(&ldquo;the Holy City&rdquo; cf. Arab. <em>al quds <\/em>). The basic meaning is that of dedication to God and the service of God, as is said elsewhere of the Sabbath (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODE0XQ==\">59:13 <\/a>) and of more pedestrian matters (e.g., Tyrian merchandise, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MDk2XQ==\">23:18 <\/a>). The other title, <em>g\u0115\u02beull&icirc;m <\/em>,, &ldquo;the Redeemed,&rdquo; is reminiscent of the &ldquo;Redeemed&rdquo; for whom alone the holy way, the <em>via sacra <\/em>,(<em>derek haqq\u014dde&scaron; <\/em>), was laid down, according to <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODMyOSI6Mn0=\">35:8&ndash;9 <\/a>. The names for the city&mdash; <em>d\u0115r&ucirc;&scaron;&acirc; <\/em>,(&ldquo;Sought Out,&rdquo; &ldquo;Sought After&rdquo;) and <em>\u02bf&icirc;r lo\u02be ne\u02bf\u0115z\u0101b&acirc; <\/em>,(&ldquo;City not Abandoned&rdquo;)&mdash;represent one application of the theme of eschatological reversal to Jerusalem (cf. the name <em>\u02bf\u0103z&ucirc;b&acirc; <\/em>,, &ldquo;Abandoned,&rdquo; <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODU5XQ==\">62:4 <\/a>). <\/p> <p>Blenkinsopp, J.
