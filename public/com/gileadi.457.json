    "html": "<p>A lack of understanding of the nature of God&mdash;which stems from adulation of God substitutes&mdash;has the pernicious effect of separating people from their Maker. Instead of seeing things from his perspective, they grow incapable of spiritual discernment. Even when they worship whom they assume is God, their estrangement from him prevents them from being saved by him. Isaiah&rsquo;s view of the earth from above&mdash;as a &ldquo;sphere,&rdquo; not as flat&mdash;God grants to those who worship him in truth (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4Mjk3LDE4MzAwXQ==\">Isaiah 33:17, 20<\/a>). Created as a &ldquo;tent&rdquo; or habitation for his children, the heavens and the earth are his handiwork.<\/p>",
