He now calls Israel, the literal seed of Abraham, whom he has gathered from the nations of the earth to the islands (America), to be his servant in bringing judgment upon all the nations of the earth. The Doctrine and Covenants identifies the Latter-day Saints who had gathered as the literal seed of Abraham (see <a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 103:17; 132:30<\/a>) and as the Lord's servants (see <a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 93:46; 133:30<\/a>). Thus chapter 41 is a prophecy of latter-day Israel, called initially to gather upon the isles of the sea (America) to be servants in the hand of the Lord to fulfill the covenant he made with Abraham to bear the ministry and the priesthood to the nations of the earth.<\/p>     ",
