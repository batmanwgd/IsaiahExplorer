    "html": " <p>The sacred knowledge of God will prevail on earth (see Smith, <em>Teachings, <\/em> p. 93), truth from which no one can hide. Elder Orson Pratt wrote: &ldquo;The knowledge of God will then cover the earth as the waters cover the mighty deep. There will be no place of ignorance, no place of darkness, no place for those that will not serve God. Why? Because Jesus, the Great Creator, and also the Great Redeemer, will be himself on the earth, and his holy angels will be on the earth, and all the resurrected Saints that have died in former dispensations will all come forth, and they will be on the earth. What a happy earth this creation will be, when this purifying process shall come, and the earth be filled with the knowledge of God as the waters cover the great deep! What a change! Travel, then, from one end of the earth to another, you can find no wicked man, no drunken man, no man to blaspheme the name of the Great Creator, no one to lay hold on his neighbor&rsquo;s goods, and steal them, no one to commit whoredoms&mdash;for all who commit whoredoms will be thrust down to hell, saith the Lord God Almighty, and all persons who commit sin will be speedily visited by the judgments of the Almighty!&rdquo; (In <em>Journal of Discourses, <\/em> 21:325.) <\/p> <p>The promises of revelation for this great era are outlined in the Doctrine and Covenants (see <a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 101:32&ndash;34 <\/a>). <\/p> <p class=\"cite\"> LDS Church Educational System Old Testament Student Manual, 1 Kings&ndash;Malachi, Religion 302, Chapter 13, Item 59 <\/p> ",
