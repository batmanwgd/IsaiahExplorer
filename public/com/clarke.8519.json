    "html": "<p><em>The Lord hath a sacrifice \"For Jehovah celebrateth a sacrifice\" -<\/em>Ezekiel,  <a class=\"ref\">Ezekiel 39:16,  Ezekiel 39:17<\/a>, has manifestly imitated this place of Isaiah. He hath set forth the great leaders and princes of the adverse powers under the same emblems of goats, bulls, rams, fatlings, etc., and has added to the boldness of the imagery, by introducing God as summoning all the fowls of the air, and all the beasts of the field, and bidding them to the feast which he has prepared for them by the slaughter of the enemies of his people: - <\/p>\n\n<p>   \"And thou, son of man,<\/p>\n\n<p>  Thus saith the Lord Jehovah,<\/p>\n\n<p>Say to the bird of every wing,<\/p>\n\n<p>And to every beast of the field:<\/p>\n\n<p>Assemble yourselves, and come;<\/p>\n\n<p>Gather together from every side,<\/p>\n\n<p>To the sacrifice which I make for you,<\/p>\n\n<p>A great slaughter on the mountains of Israel.<\/p>\n\n<p>And ye shall eat flesh and drink blood:<\/p>\n\n<p>The flesh of the mighty shall ye eat,<\/p>\n\n<p>And the blood of the lofty of the earth shall ye drink;<\/p>\n\n<p>Of rams, of lambs, and of goats,<\/p>\n\n<p>Of bullocks, all of them the fat ones of Bashan;<\/p>\n\n<p>And ye shall eat fat, till ye are cloyed,<\/p>\n\n<p>And drink blood, till ye are drunken;<\/p>\n\n<p>   Of my slaughter, which I have slain for you.\"<\/p>\n\n<p>The sublime author of the  <a class=\"ref\">Revelation 19:17,  Revelation 19:18<\/a>, has taken this image from Ezekiel, rather than from Isaiah.<\/p>",
