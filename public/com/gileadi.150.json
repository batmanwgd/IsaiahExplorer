He is aware of their covenant relationship with their Creator, but he assumes that their God is no more a threat to him than the gods of the nations he has already conquered (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 36:18-20; 37:11-13<\/a>). His successes lead him to believe that nothing is impossible that he sets his mind to do. He imagines that his henchmen will rule under him as his empire spreads to the ends of the earth (cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 14:21<\/a>). He fails to perceive, however, that his victories are but momentary (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxNzg2M10seyIxNzg3NSI6NH1d\">vv 12, 24-27<\/a>).<\/p>",
