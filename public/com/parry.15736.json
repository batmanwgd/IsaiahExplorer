And they shall drink, and be moved, and be mad, because of the sword that I will send among them. Then took I the cup at the Lord's hand, and made all the nations to drink, unto whom the Lord had sent me\" (<a class=\"ref\">Jer. 25:15-17<\/a>; see <a class=\"ref\">Ezek. 23:32-34<\/a>). Jeremiah's words mark the beginning of the curse; Isaiah's words mark its removal in the last days.<\/p> ",
