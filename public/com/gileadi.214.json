Although Jehovah sends prophets to warn of his Day of Judgment (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxNzk4NF0seyIxODAzMyI6Mn1d\">Isaiah 16:14; 20:3-4<\/a>), Greater Babylon&rsquo;s inhabitants foolishly assume that Assyria will abide by the peace treaties it makes and not resort to treachery: &ldquo;See, their stalwarts sob in public; the champions of peace weep bitterly. The highways are desolate, travel is at an end. The treaties have been violated, their signatories held in contempt; man is disregarded&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODI4NyI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 33:7-8<\/a>; cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MjgxXQ==\">33:1<\/a>). <\/p> ",
