We ourselves walk down into bondage in Egypt symbolically when we walk the path of sin.<\/p> <p> <i>have not asked at my mouth. <\/i>Judah's wicked leaders were not praying to the Lord or seeking the Lord's counsel through his prophets.<\/p> <p><i>strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh. <\/i>Jerusalem's leaders sought to strengthen themselves by establishing an alliance with Egypt, ruled by Pharaoh Psamtik I, who seemed to offer strength and protection. The consequence of Judah's alliance with Egypt was the eventual enslavement and deportation of the people by the Assyrians, to their shame and confusion. It is always a sin to trust in the arm of flesh rather than the power of God.<\/p> <p><i>trust<\/i> <i>in<\/i> <i>the<\/i> <i>shadow<\/i> <i>of<\/i> <i>Egypt.<\/i> Judah trusted in Egypt's military might and political strength. Isaiah's reference to <i>shadow of Egypt <\/i>indicates that the might and strength of Egypt are as a mere shadow\u2014fleeting, dark, and insubstantial\u2014when compared to the power of God.<\/p> ",
