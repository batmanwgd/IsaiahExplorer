    "html": " <i>In that day.<\/i> This speaks of our day. The same expression links earlier sections of Isaiah (2:12, 17, 20; 3:7, 18; 4:1) and is a continuation of the day-of-the-Lord theme.<\/p> <p> <i>branch.<\/i> This<i> <\/i>word may have a double meaning. First, the Lord is called <i>Branch <\/i>messianically (<a class=\"ref\">Jer. 23;6:12<\/a>). Second, an offshoot of the house of Israel is often called \"a righteous branch\" (<a class=\"ref\">Jacob 2:25<\/a>) or \"a branch of the house of Israel\" (<a class=\"ref\">1 Ne. 15:12; 2 Ne. 3:5<\/a>). The context of this section suggests that the <i>branch<\/i> represents a specific remnant, or <i>branch,<\/i> of Israel that remains in Israel after God's judgments, identified in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzM3XQ==\">Isa. 3<\/a>. <\/p> <p><i>fruit.<\/i> Those who \"are escaped of Israel and Judah\" will be blessed with the bounties and blessings of the earth. The earth will be fruitful once again because of the presence of temples. \"The temple,\" says John Lundquist, \"is associated with abundance and prosperity, indeed is perceived as the giver of these.\" Again, we are reminded by the promise of Book of Mormon prophets that those who are obedient to God's commands will prosper in the land.<\/p> ",
