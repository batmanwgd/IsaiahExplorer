Furthermore, for a woman to be childless was considered a great curse. (See <a class=\"ref\">Genesis 30:22-24; Luke 1:24-25<\/a>.) Thus, Isaiah sees desperate women who want to marry to remove the stigma of being unmarried and childless. As an interesting side note, Victor Ludlow suggested the possibility that many men of this future time period might be incapable of fathering children because of sterility caused by exposure to radiation.
