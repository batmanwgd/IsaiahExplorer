The prophet, as herald, or officer, to proclaim the summons to the court, calls upon all created beings, celestial and terrestrial, to attend and bear witness to the truth of his plea, and the justice of his cause.\u201d \u2014 Bishop Lowth. See the same scene more fully displayed, <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 50:3-4<\/a>. With the like invocation Moses begins his sublime song, <a class=\"ref\">Deuteronomy 32:1<\/a>; see also <a class=\"ref\">Micah 6:1-2<\/a>. <i>For the Lord hath spoken <\/i>\u2014 Or, <i>It is Jehovah that speaketh, <\/i>as Bishop Lowth renders it, there seeming to be an impropriety in demanding attention to a speech already delivered. <i>I have nourished, <\/i>&c. \u2014 I first made them a people, and, until this time, I have sustained and blessed them above all other nations: God\u2019s care over them is compared to that of parents in nursing and training up their children. <i>And they have rebelled against me<\/i> \u2014 Or, as  <span class=\"hebrew_text\">\u05e4\u05e9\u05c1\u05e2\u05d5 \u05d1\u05d9<\/span>may be rendered, <i>have revolted from me <\/i>\u2014 Even they, peculiarly favoured as they have been, have proved deserters, nay, traitors, against my crown and dignity. This is the Lord\u2019s plea against them, of the equity of which he is willing that all the creatures should be judges.<\/p>",
