Kimchi says that Rabbi Joshua ben Levi proposes this objection: \"It is written, 'Behold, he will come in the clouds of heaven as the son of man,' <a class=\"ref\">Daniel 7:13<\/a>; and elsewhere it is written, 'He cometh lowly, and riding upon an ass,' <a class=\"ref\">Zechariah 9:9<\/a>. How can these texts be reconciled? Thus: If the Jews have merit, he will come unto them in the clouds of heaven; but if they be destitute of merit, he will come unto them riding upon an ass.\" Now out of their own mouth they may be condemned. They were truly destitute of all merit when Jesus Christ came into Jerusalem riding upon an ass, according to the letter of the above prophecy; and they neither acknowledged nor received him. And that they were destitute of merit their destruction by the Romans, which shortly followed their rejection of him, sufficiently proves. <\/p> ",
