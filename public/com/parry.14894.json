    "html": " <i>as the hunted deer\/as a sheep that no man taketh up.<\/i> Isaiah compares a wicked person during the judgments of the last days to deer and sheep. A hunted deer is endangered when hunters are present, and sheep are endangered when shepherds are absent. The imagery implies that the wicked will be like a hunted deer; they will flee for their lives during this time (there will be wars\u2014Matt. 24:6), and they will be like unprotected sheep, meaning those who have not accepted Jesus as their shepherd may not receive his protection.<\/p> <p><i>every man turn to his own people\/flee every one into his own land.<\/i> During God's judgments, the wicked will flee (because of fear; <a class=\"ref\">Jer. 50:16<\/a>) to their lands and homes in Babylon (meaning the world), perhaps looking for safety among their own political and economic institutions. The righteous will flee from Babylon and its carnal preoccupations to Zion and its temples (spiritual concerns; <a class=\"ref\">Jer. 50:28; D&amp;C 133:12-<\/a> 13). The Israelite exodus from Egypt under Moses' direction and the Lehite exodus from Jerusalem under Lehi's direction serve as examples of people who flee from the world (<a class=\"ref\">1 Ne. 3:18<\/a>) under direction of living prophets to promised lands and the Lord's temple.<\/p> ",
