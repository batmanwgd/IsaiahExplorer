    "html": "<p>The law of justice requires punishment for every sin. In making an Atonement for the sins of all, Jesus satisfied the full demands of justice and made forgiveness of sins possible. President Joseph Fielding Smith explained:<\/p><p>&ldquo;Then Jesus Christ came upon the scene as the Mediator between man and God, and the Advocate for man with the Father. He pleads our cause. As our Mediator, through his ministry, he labors to reconcile us, to bring us into agreement with God his Father.<\/p><p>&ldquo;An advocate is one who defends or pleads for or in behalf of another. A mediator is one who reconciles or brings about agreement between parties.<\/p><p>&ldquo;That is part of his great mission. He stands between the Father and man. When he was upon earth, he prayed frequently for his disciples, pleading with his Father in their behalf, and he has been pleading ever since, and he stands between us and God our Father.&rdquo; (<em>Doctrines of Salvation,<\/em> 1:26&ndash;27.)<\/p><p class=\"cite\"> LDS Church Educational System Old Testament Student Manual, 1 Kings&ndash;Malachi, Religion 302, Chapter 17, Item 26<\/p> ",
