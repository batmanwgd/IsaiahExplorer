A similar appeal he makes in <a class=\"ref\">Micah 6:3<\/a> : &lsquo;O my people, what have I done unto thee? and wherein have I wearied thee? Testify against me.&rsquo; He intended to &ldquo;punish&rdquo; them <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc3NDUiOjJ9XQ==\">Isaiah 5:5-6<\/a> , and he appeals to them for the justice of it. He would do to them as they would do to a vineyard that had been carefully prepared and guarded, and which yet was valueless. A similar appeal he makes in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc2NzMiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 1:18<\/a> ; and our Saviour made an application remarkably similar in his parable of the vineyard, <a class=\"ref\">Matthew 21:40-43<\/a>. It is not improbable that he had his eye on this very place in Isaiah; and it is, therefore, the more remarkable that the Jews did not understand the bearing of his discourse.<\/p>",
