    "html": " <p> <em>In that day shall Israel be the third <\/em>&mdash;That is, the three shall be united as one people. Instead of being rival, hostile, and contending kingdoms, they shall be united and friendly; and instead of having different and jarring religions, they shall all worship the same God. The prophecy rather refers to the spread of the true religion, and the worship of the true God, than to a political or civil alliance. <\/p> <p> <em>Even a blessing <\/em>&mdash;It shall be a source of blessing, because from Judea the true religion would extend into the other lands. <\/p> <p> <em>In the midst of the land <\/em>&mdash;That is, &ldquo;the united land&rdquo;&mdash;composed of the three nations now joined in alliance. Judea was situated in the &ldquo;midst&rdquo; of this united land, or occupied a central position between the two. It was also true that it occupied a central position in regard to the whole earth, and that from it, as a radiating point, the true religion was disseminated throughout all nations. <\/p> ",
