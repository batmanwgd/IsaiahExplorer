This refers to Jesus Christ, who is \"the fountain of all righteousness\" (<a class=\"ref\">Ether 12:28; 8:26<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\">1 Ne. 2:9<\/a>) and \"the fountain of living waters\" (<a class=\"ref\">Jer. 2:13; 17:13<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\">Ps. 36:8-9<\/a>). The image of waters is symbolic of Jesus because he cleanses the righteous who enter the waters of baptism; he also invites us to drink from the waters of salvation, which forever quench the thirst of those who partake.<\/p> <p>The waters of Shiloah are located in southeast Jerusalem, possibly belonging to the same body of water as the pool of Siloam of the New Testament. In 8:6, when the people reject the soft rolling waters of Shiloah, they reject Jehovah the King. This rejection results in God's sending against them a great destructive river, representative of the king of Assyria.<\/p> <p><i>Rezin and Remaliah's son.<\/i> Rezin was the king of Syria, and Pekah, the son of Remaliah, was the king of Israel (7:1-9).<\/p> ",
