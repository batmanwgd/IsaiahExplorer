    "html": "<p><em>I also will choose their delusions<\/em>&mdash;Margin, &lsquo;Devices.&rsquo; The Hebrew word rendered here &lsquo;delusions&rsquo; and &lsquo;devices&rsquo; (\u05ea\u05e2\u05dc\u05d5\u05bc\u05dc\u05d9\u05dd ta\u201ba\u0306lu\u0302l\u0131\u0302ym) properly denotes petulance, sauciness; and then vexation, adverse destiny, from \u05e2\u05dc\u05dc \u201ba\u0302lal, to do, to accomplish, to do evil, to maltreat. It is not used in the sense of delusions, or devices; and evidently here means the same as calamity or punishment. Compare the Hebrew in <a class=\"ref\">Lamentations 1:22<\/a>. Lowth and Noyes render it, Calamities; though Jerome and the Septuagint understand it in the sense of illusions or delusions; the former rendering it, &lsquo;Illusiones, and the latter &epsilon;\u0313&mu;&pi;&alpha;&iota;\u0301&gamma;&mu;&alpha;&tau;&alpha; empaigmata&mdash;&lsquo;delusions.&rsquo; The parallelism requires us to understand it of calamity, or something answering to &lsquo;fear,&rsquo; or that which was dreaded; and the sense undoubtedly is, that God would choose out for them the kind of punishment which would be expressive of his sense of the evil of their conduct.<\/p><p><em>And will bring their fears upon them<\/em>&mdash;That is, the punishment which they have so much dreaded, or which they had so much reason to apprehend.<\/p><p><em>Because when I called<\/em>&mdash;(See the notes at <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4OTEwXQ==\">Isaiah 65:12<\/a>).<\/p><p><em>But they did evil before mine eyes<\/em>&mdash;(See the notes at <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4OTAxXQ==\">Isaiah 65:3<\/a>).<\/p>",
