His description of this holy city is similar to that given by John the Revelator. (<a class=\"ref\">Revelation 21:18-21<\/a>.) If verses eleven and twelve do not directly relate to that great city, it is possiblethat they provide symbolic descriptions of conditions prevalent in the societies or stakes of Zion established throughout the earth. <\/p>     <table>         <tbody>             <tr>                 <td>11 O thou afflicted, tossed with tempest, and not comforted<u>, b<\/u> ehold, I will lay thy stones with fair <i>colours,<\/i> and lay thy foundations with sapphires.                     <br>                     <br>12 And I will make thy windows of agates, and thy gates of carbuncles, and all thy borders of pleasant stones.                     <br>                     <br>13 And all thy children shall be taught of the Lord; and great shall be the peace of thy children.                     <br>                 <\/td>                 <td>11 O thou afflicted, tossed with tempest, and not comforted<u>!
