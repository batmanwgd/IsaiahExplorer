    "html": "<p><i>Days.<\/i>  The whole time of the new law, from the coming of Christ till the end of the world, is called in the Scripture <i>the last days;<\/i> because no other age, or time shall come after it, but only eternity. (Challoner) --- It is therefore styled the last hour, 1 John ii.  (Worthington) --- <i>Mountains.<\/i>  This shews the perpetual visibility of the Church of Christ: for a mountain upon the top of mountains cannot be hid.  (Challoner) --- This evidently regards the Church, Matthew v.  (Worthington) --- The Jews can never shew the fulfillment of this prophecy in any material temple.  Micheas (iv. 1.) copies this text.<\/p>",
