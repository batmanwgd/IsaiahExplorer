    "html": "<p>The idols of Babylon represented as so far from being able to bear the burden of their votaries, that they themselves are borne by beasts of burden into captivity,  <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 46:1<\/a>,  <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 46:2<\/a>. This beautifully contrasted with the tender care of God, in bearing his people from first to last in his arms, and delivering them from their distress,  <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 46:3<\/a>,  <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 46:4<\/a>. The prophet, then, with his usual force and elegance, goes on to show the folly of idolatry, and the utter inability of idols,  <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 46:5-7<\/a>. From which he passes with great ease to the contemplation of the attributes and perfections of the true God,  <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 46:8-10<\/a>. Particularly that prescience which foretold the deliverance of the Jews from the Babylonish captivity, with all its leading circumstances; and also that very remote event of which it is the type in the days of the Messiah,  <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 46:11-13<\/a>.<\/p>",
