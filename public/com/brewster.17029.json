The plea of the prophet is for those who are presently unanchored in the gospel to cease their pursuit of the ways of the world. \"Brace yourselves against the winds of wickedness! Hold fast to the iron rod whereby you will be strengthened against sin!\" (See <a class=\"ref\">1 Nephi 8:30<\/a>; \"The Iron Rod,\" Hymns, no. 274.)<\/p>",
