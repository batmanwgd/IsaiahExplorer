Its parallel, &ldquo;your Savior,&rdquo; affirms that Israel&rsquo;s God, not some other, is their Savior (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODI5MSwxODU4MywxODY2MywxODgzOF0seyIxODg3NSI6Mn1d\">v 11; Isaiah 45:21; 49:26; 60:16; 63:8-9<\/a>). Although other saviors exist, such as Jehovah&rsquo;s servant and his associates, they only qualify Jehovah&rsquo;s people for salvation; they don&rsquo;t themselves save them (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MDI1LDE4Mzg4LDE4ODc2LDE4ODg0LDE4OTA2XQ==\">Isaiah 19:20; 37:35; 63:9, 17; 65:8<\/a>). Other peoples become a &ldquo;ransom&rdquo; for them when the king of Assyria\/Babylon slays the nations among whom they live, thinking he slays Jehovah&rsquo;s people also.<\/p>",
