Or it may refer to the desert of Sin, which is in the peninsula of Sinai. The point is that the Lord will gather his people from wherever they have been scattered. The same is true spiritually. The Lord will find us wherever we are and bring us back to our inheritance, if we will hearken to him and do our part.<\/p> ",
