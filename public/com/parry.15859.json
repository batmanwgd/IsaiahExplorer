    "html": " <p><i>When we feel lost from God, he has not lost his power to bless and help us, and he continues to hear our prayers. But our iniquities can separate us from him. The Lord here speaks plainly against those who give themselves to sin. Israel apparently is aware of her state, for she laments her darkness and blindness. The state of those who choose sin is truly a miserable one.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>When the Lord comes again, he will come in vengeance, and he will punish the wicked for their sins. But he will also come in mercy and love, bringing blessings to the repentant in Zion. It is a regular duty of the Lord's people to search their hearts, always seeking to know if they are clean and worthy. When the Lord comes again, will we rejoice to see him? Or will we tremble and fear because of our unworthiness?<\/i><\/p> ",
