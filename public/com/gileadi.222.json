    "html": "<p>A reversal of circumstances between Zion and Greater Babylon marks Jehovah&rsquo;s Day of Judgment. Although the &ldquo;summer fruit and harvest&rdquo; denotes the most joyous time of the year, that joy turns to gloom as Moab, which formerly enjoyed prosperity, now lies in ruins. Jehovah&rsquo;s elect, on the other hand&mdash;who suffered gloom prior to Jehovah&rsquo;s Day of Judgment&mdash;now experience joy: &ldquo;Jehovah is comforting Zion, bringing solace to all her ruins; he is making her wilderness like Eden, her desert as the garden of Jehovah. Joyful rejoicing takes place there, thanksgiving with the voice<strong><\/strong> of song&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 51:3<\/a>).<\/p>",
