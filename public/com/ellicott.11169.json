Better, is straight, or is even\u2014i.e., leads on without interruption to its appointed end. So, in the second clause, instead of \u201cthou shalt weigh the path,\u201d which conveys a not very intelligible thought, we render, makest smooth the path. Probably, too, the word translated, \u201cmost upright,\u201d as if it were a vocative, should be taken adverbially. The verse is, as it were, an echo of <a class=\"ref\">Proverbs 4:26; Proverbs 5:6; Proverbs 5:21 <\/a>. <\/p> ",
