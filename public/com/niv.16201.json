He is the gracious promise for which they wait (33:2). This promise was fulfilled in multiple ways throughout Israel\u2019s history. It was immediately fulfilled when Hezekiah, the anointed king, trusted God for deliverance and experienced that deliverance in dramatic ways. It was fulfilled later when God delivered his people from Babylonian captivity and restored them to their own land. It was fulfilled in the more distant future when God revealed his Messiah in Jesus Christ. And it will be finally fulfilled in the last days, when the Messiah rules the earth by the rod of his mouth.<\/p>         <p>\u2003In the context of chapter 33, there can be little question that the \u201cking\u201d referred to here is the Lord. Not only is it clear in verses 1\u201316 that he is the monarch of the earth, but verse 22 specifically identifies \u201cthe LORD\u201d as \u201cour king.\u201d It is hard to imagine that Isaiah might have Hezekiah, the only likely human claimant in the late 700s, in mind in verse 17 when verse 22 is so specific. Moreover, the realm of Hezekiah was anything but stretching \u201cafar.\u201d It was closely constricted.<\/p>         <p>\u2003Instead, the \u201cking\u201d here is the One to whom Hezekiah goes in humble subjection (37:16\u201320) and who thereby removes the Assyrian siege \u201ctowers\u201d and tribute (NIV \u201crevenue\u201d) officials from Jerusalem (33:18). This divine king makes it so that the alien Assyrian speech is not heard in Judah for a long time (33:19; cf. 28:11). Now there is \u201cpeaceful [secure]\u201d \u201cZion,\u201d a place whose \u201cfestivals\u201d will no longer be disgusting to God (cf. 29:1\u20132). The prophet uses a bit of an oxymoron to describe the city as a permanent \u201ctent.\u201d Perhaps the thought is that all our human habitations are as fragile as tents\u2014and always will be. But if those tents are given over to God, he can make them more secure than the mightiest fortress that is only dependent on human power for its survival (see also 54:2).<\/p>         <p>\u2003From the metaphor of the tent, the author moves to water imagery. The city will have peaceful \u201crivers and streams\u201d flowing through it. As in Psalm 46, a river is a symbol of peace and abundance. The waves of the sea crash and roar destructively, but a river flows quietly along, providing water for all sorts of constructive uses. Isaiah underscores the peaceful nature of God\u2019s supply when he says no vessel of war (\u201cgalley\u201d) will sail on the rivers of Zion. Why? Because of the righteous character of the Lord, who is Israel\u2019s \u201cking\u201d (33:22). He will bring in order (\u201cjudge\u201d); he will bring in obedience to the Torah (\u201clawgiver\u201d). He is Moses, Samuel, and David all rolled together. With One like that in charge, peace and prosperity are assured\u2014even better, salvation. Such a One can deliver us from any situation of life, whether it be aggression from enemies, or a broken law, or a world of disorder.<\/p>         <p>\u2003It is not clear who is being addressed in the first half of 33:23. However, in the overall context, it is most likely the destroying, betraying nation with which the chapter began. This warship tried to sail against Zion, but it came up against a greater enemy in the Lord than it had planned for. Like a mighty windstorm he has whirled down on them, leaving the \u201csail\u201d collapsed and the \u201crigging\u201d sagging. Thus, all the \u201cplunder\u201d they had collected will be carried off by their intended victims (cf. 33:4).<\/p>         <p>\u2003The final promise for the \u201cZion\u201d ruled by the Messiah is that it will be a place of health, both physical and spiritual. All the effects of \u201csin\u201d will be done away with, and creation will be seen again in the manner in which it was first intended.<\/p>          <h4>Bridging Contexts<\/h4>     <p>I<small>T IS HARD<\/small> for those of us who live in democratic countries to relate to this emphasis on a king, since we have had a long tradition of government by the people. However, it does not take much disorder in our lives before we begin to clamor for a strong leader. This is what happened in Germany in the 1930s. To be sure, their experience of representative democracy was limited, but they were a strong, capable people. Nevertheless, when the Weimar Republic began to come apart with raging inflation and widespread unemployment, Hitler had no difficulty in convincing the German populace to give him all the powers of a king and then some.<\/p>     <p>\u2003The same thing had happened earlier in Russia. When the inept Czar Nicholas was finally deposed, the situation in Russia was chaotic. In that setting, Lenin was able to impose his will on the nation and become in effect the new czar. Tragically, he proved much more despotic than Nicholas had been. In the United States in the 1930s, many Americans were more than willing to make Franklin Roosevelt president-for-life. To be sure, his powers were sharply circumscribed by the Constitution and by Congress. Nevertheless, the similarity is clear: When society and government begin to break down, we want a strong leader to take charge. That is what Isaiah is promising his people. God will give them a leader who is both strong and righteous, visionary and compassionate.<\/p>     <h4>Contemporary Significance<\/h4>     <p>A<small>S NOTED ABOVE<\/small>, we can apply this message to at least four different historic settings. The first is in Isaiah\u2019s own day, as godly Hezekiah led his people to trust God and in so doing led them into a wonderful experience of God\u2019s power and trustworthiness. The second is the deliverance from Babylon that was completed during the time of Nehemiah, Ezra, and Malachi. The people of Judah once again experienced a secure Zion where God\u2019s bounty was provided. The fourth is in the consummation of all things, when there will be no rival to God\u2019s kingdom. The third is the one in which we live today, the one in which God\u2019s Messiah has been fully revealed and in which we see that God\u2019s promises are spiritual before they are physical.<\/p>     <p>\u2003One of the ways in which the revelation of Christ solves a potential problem in this passage as well as other messianic promises in the Old Testament is in his divinity. On the one hand, we see a king who is human. Isaiah 32:1\u2013 8 depicts a realm in which humans are active. To be sure, they are active in remarkable ways, but it is still a human realm that is being described. On the other hand, the king described here in chapter 33 can be none other than the Lord\u2014but he is the Lord who somehow fulfills the role previously filled by humans: judge, lawgiver, king.<\/p>     <p>\u2003When we think of what is called the first Christian creed (\u201cJesus is Lord,\u201d cf. Rom. 10:9) and recognize Jesus as the God-Man, this apparent contradiction is resolved. God rules both on earth and in heaven. He does not rule from heaven as an absentee ruler, nor does he rule on earth as a limited and finite human. We can imagine the prophet puzzling over what he has said, and wondering like Mary did many centuries later, \u201cHow can these things be?\u201d They can be if the human Messiah is also the divine King.<\/p>     <p>\u2003What does Christ offer us today? Several things emerge from this passage. He offers beauty and wide opportunities (33:17). He offers security (33:18\u2013 20). He offers us deliverance (33:22). He offers us health in its most comprehensive form (33:24). We may think of <em>beauty<\/em> as a nonessential, but that is obviously not how God sees it. When we look at creation, we see an abundance of things beautiful. Why is beauty a characteristic of this heavenly-earthly King? Among the factors that make for beauty are harmony, symmetry, rhythm, and balance. When Christ becomes the King of our lives, these are some of the things he brings to us. He is in perfect harmony with the Father as he lives out a life of rhythmic giving and receiving. He is never off-balance, attempting to secure his own will. In the quiet confidence of the Father\u2019s provision, there is a serenity and a wholeness that shines out of him. He offers this same beauty to us.<\/p>     <p>\u2003In Christ there are <em>endless opportunities<\/em>. He does not press us into a mold in order to produce robots who will serve him. Rather, he calls us friends, allowing each of us to achieve the maximum of what we were designed for. He allows each of us to develop in our own way because he, our King, delights to serve us. In such a relationship and with all the power of heaven at our disposal, even the most restrictive of earth\u2019s situations offers endless openings.<\/p>     <p>\u2003In Christ there is complete <em>security<\/em>. When we know that even in our darkest hour we were loved by him, we know that there is nothing we can do to make him stop loving us. Nothing can wrench us out of his hand. Could a day come when we demand that he let us go? Yes, that possibility exists. But until such a time, we are held in an unfailing grip. Inside that shelter we dare anything, knowing that in even the most tragic failure, we are his and he is ours.<\/p>     <p>\u2003In Christ there is <em>health<\/em>. Like beauty, there is both outer health and inner health, and the two are closely connected. When our sins are forgiven and our future is assured, and when we have the confidence of full provision for our needs, we can rest in him. In a rest like that, there is a soul health that will have an impact on our physical health. And even if the \u201cearthly temple\u201d is falling into that inevitable decay that is the fate of all until Christ returns, our inner life may radiate health and wholeness through Christ.<\/p>     ",
