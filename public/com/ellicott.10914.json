(Comp. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODM2MyI6NH0=\">Isaiah 37:10-13<\/a>.)<\/p> \n<p>I have removed the bounds of the people.\u2014The practice has, of course, more or less characterised the conquerors of all ages in their attempts to merge independent nationalities into one great empire; but it was pursued more systematically by Assyria than by most others. To be \u201ca remover of boundaries and landmarks \u201cwas the title in which an Assyrian king most exulted. (Comp. inscription of Rimmon-nirari, in Smith\u2019s Assyrian Discoveries, pp. 243, 244. Records of the Past, xi. 3).<\/p> \n<p>I have put down the inhabitants like a valiant man.\u2014Better, I have put down those that sat firmly. The Hebrew word for \u201cvaliant man\u201d means primarily a \u201cbull,\u201d and then figuratively, as in Isa xxxiv, 7; <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 22:12<\/a> , a \u201cmighty one.\u201d The fact that the bull appears so frequently in Assyrian monuments as a symbol of sovereignty, mates it probable that the word is used in that symbolic sense here. In <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 78:25<\/a> , the \u201cmighty ones\u201d to whom it is applied are those of the host of heaven, the angels of God.<\/p> ",
