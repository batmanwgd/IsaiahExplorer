It makes a solecism in this place; for according to the constant usage of the Hebrew language, the adjective, in a phrase of this kind, ought to follow the substantive; and <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05e2\u05d1\u05d3\u05d9 \u05e6\u05d3\u05d9\u05e7 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">tsaddik abdi<\/span>, in Hebrew, would be as absurd as \"shall my servant righteous justify,\" in English. Add to this, that it makes the hemistich too long.<\/p>",
