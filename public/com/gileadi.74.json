With the aid of his servants the prophets, he cultivates it and clears it of &ldquo;stones,&rdquo; removing its former wicked occupants and preparing the ground for planting the new. He builds a watchtower so that his prophets&mdash;their watchmen&mdash;may keep vigil. He hews a winepress, an ecclesiastical or communal framework in which his people can bring forth the fruits of their labors. But instead of producing good fruit, they produce &ldquo;wild fruit&rdquo; (<em>be&rsquo;usim<\/em>)&mdash;fruit that rots before it ripens (cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzcyMiI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 3:14-15<\/a>).<\/p>",
