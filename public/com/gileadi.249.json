Jehovah&rsquo;s intent, however, is to cause the wicked to &ldquo;turn back&rdquo; to him&mdash;to &ldquo;repent&rdquo; and &ldquo;return&rdquo;&mdash;so that he may heal them. He heals them when at last they &ldquo;see with their eyes and hear with their ears, understand in their heart, and repent, and are healed&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc3ODAiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 6:10<\/a>; cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg3ODgiOjh9XQ==\">58:1-8<\/a>). Too often, however, only when wickedness results in covenant curses, does such healing occur (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgxNDciOjF9LHsiMTgxNTYiOjJ9LHsiMTg3MzEiOjJ9XQ==\">Isaiah 26:16; 27:4-5; 54:7-8<\/a>).<\/p>",
