    "html": " <p> <i>And with bows they shall dash in pieces the children.<\/i>, Some render it, <i>they shall cut<\/i>,. They think that the language is exaggerated, as if they made use of the children of the Babylonians in place of <i>arrows<\/i>, and afterwards dashed them to the ground, that they might be broken with greater violence. But I choose rather to take a more simple view of the words, that the cruelty of the Medes will be so great, that they will not spare even infant children, on whom men do not commonly lay hands unless where there is the utmost barbarity; and, in short, that no allowance will be made for age, as we have formerly said. <\/p>\n <p>But we do not read that the Medes exercised so great cruelty, and Babylon stood and flourished for a very long period after that calamity; and although the seat of the empire was removed from it, still it retained its name and reputation. Besides, after the dawn of the following day, no cruelty was exercised but against those who bore arms. Though it was the Prophet\u2019s design to include other judgments of God which awaited the Babylonians, and by which the first calamity was followed long afterwards, yet it is not improperly or unseasonably that he describes the barbarous manners of the nation, that the Jews may be more fully aware that a just reward is prepared for the tyranny of Babylon. Nor can it be doubted that it was in reliance on this promise that believers afterwards presented that prayer; <\/p>\n <p> <span> Blessed is he who shall dash thy little ones against the stones.\n(<\/span>, <a class=\"ref\"><\/a>.) <\/p>",
