    "html": "<p><em>That saith of Cyrus<\/em>&mdash;This is the first time in which Cyrus is expressly named by Isaiah, though he is often referred to. He is mentioned by him only in one other place expressly by name <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 45:1<\/a>. He is several times mentioned elsewhere in the Old Testament <a class=\"ref\">2 Chronicles 26:22-23; Ezra 1:1-2, Ezra 1:7; Ezra 3:7; Ezra 4:3; Ezra 5:13, Ezra 5:17; Daniel 1:21; Daniel 6:28; Daniel 10:1<\/a>. He began his reign about 550 b.c., and this prophecy was therefore delivered not far from a hundred and fifty years before he ascended the throne. None but God himself, or he whom God inspired, could have mentioned so long before, the name of him who should deliver the Jewish people from bondage; and if this was delivered, therefore, by Isaiah, it proves that he was under divine inspiration. The name of Cyrus (\u05db\u05d5\u05e8\u05e9\u05c1 ko\u0302resh; Greek &Kappa;&upsilon;\u0342r&omicron;&sigmaf; Kuros) the Greek writers say, means &lsquo;the sun.&rsquo; It is contracted from the Persian word khorschid, which in that language has this signification. Cyrus was the celebrated king of the Medes and Persians, and was the son of Cambyses the Persian, and of Mandane, daughter of Astyages, king of the Medes. For an account of his character and reign, see the notes at <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 41:2<\/a> , where I have anticipated all that is needful to be said here.<\/p><p><em>He is my shepherd<\/em>&mdash;A shepherd is one who leads and guides a flock, and then the word denotes, by a natural and easy metaphor, a ruler, or leader of a people. Thus the name is given to Moses in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 43:2<\/a> ; compare <a class=\"ref\">Psalm 77:20<\/a> , and <a class=\"ref\">Ezekiel 34:23<\/a>. The name here is given to Cyrus because God would employ him to conduct his people again to their own land. The word &lsquo;my&rsquo; implies, that he was under the direction of God, and was employed in his service.<\/p><p><em>And shall perform all my pleasure<\/em>&mdash;In destroying the city and kingdom of Babylon; in delivering the Jewish captives; and in rebuilding Jerusalem, and the temple.<\/p><p><em>Even saying to Jerusalem<\/em>&mdash;That is, I say to Jerusalem. The Vulgate, and the Septuagint renders this as meaning God, and not Cyrus, and doubtless this is the true construction. It was one of the things which God would do, to say to Jerusalem that it should be rebuilt.<\/p><p><em>And to the temple<\/em>&mdash;Though now desolate and in ruins, yet it shall be reconstructed, and its foundation shall be firmly laid. The phrase &lsquo;to Jerusalem,&rsquo; and &lsquo;to the temple,&rsquo; should be rendered &lsquo;of,&rsquo; in accordance with a common signification of the preposition \u05dc (l), and as it is rendered in the former part of the verse when speaking of Cyrus (compare <a class=\"ref\">Genesis 20:13; Judges 9:54<\/a> ). It was indeed under the direction of Cyrus that the city of Jerusalem was rebuilt, and the temple reconstructed <a class=\"ref\">Ezra 1:1<\/a>; but still it was to be traced to God, who raised him up for this purpose. That this passage was seen by Cyrus is the testimony of Josephus, and is morally certain from the nature of the case, since, otherwise, it is incredible that he should have aided the Jews in returning to their own land, and in rebuilding their city and temple (see the Introduction, Section 2). This is one of the numerous instances in the Bible, in which God claims control and jurisdiction even over pagan princes and monarchs, and in which he says that their plans are under his direction, and made subservient to his will. It is one of the proofs that God presides over all, and that he makes the voluntary purposes of people subservient to him, and a part of the means of executing his glorious designs in relation to his people. Indeed, all the proud monarchs and conquerors of the earth have been in some sense instruments in his hand of executing his pleasure.<\/p>",
