Might not the townsmen, listening eagerly on the wall, recognise in Rabshakeh\u2019s words an echo of Isaiah\u2019s, and lose courage, as feeling that they were fighting against the God who was chastising them? The Syrian or Aramaic was a common ground for the ambassadors on both sides, as being the language of commerce and diplomacy. Rabshakeh, it would seem, could speak three languages, Assyrian, Syrian, and Hebrew; Hezekiah\u2019s ministers the two latter; the \u201cpeople on the wall\u201d only the last.<\/p>\n <p>In the Jews\u2019 language.\u2014It is uncertain whether this means simply Hebrew, which Isaiah elsewhere calls the language of Canaan (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 19:18<\/a>), or a special dialect of Judah. The Moabite stone, on the one hand, shows that Hebrew was the common speech of Palestine and the border countries. On the other hand, dialects spring up quickly. <a class=\"ref\">Nehemiah 13:24<\/a> is the only other passage (the parallels of <a class=\"ref\">2 Kings 18:26<\/a> and <a class=\"ref\">2 Chronicles 32:18<\/a> excepted) in which the term meets us in the narrower sense, and that is after the exile.<\/p>",
