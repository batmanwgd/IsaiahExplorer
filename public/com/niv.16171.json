But at the end of these seventy years, it will happen to Tyre as in the song of the prostitute:<\/p>         <blockquote>             <p>\u201cTake up a harp, walk through the city,<\/p>             <p>\u2003O prostitute forgotten;<\/p>             <p>play the harp well, sing many a song,<\/p>             <p>\u2003so that you will be remembered.\u201d<\/p>         <\/blockquote>         <p>At the end of seventy years, the LORD will deal with Tyre. She will return to her hire as a prostitute and will ply her trade with all the kingdoms on the face of the earth. Yet her profit and her earnings will be set apart for the LORD; they will not be stored up or hoarded. Her profits will go to those who live before the LORD, for abundant food and fine clothes.<\/p>     <\/blockquote>     <h4>Original Meaning<\/h4>     <p>W<small>E COME NOW<\/small> to the last of Isaiah\u2019s oracles against the nations (chs. 13\u201323). As we said at the outset, these oracles serve two purposes in the present structure of the book. (1) Isaiah promised in chapter 11 that although Judah\u2019s persistent trust of the nations instead of God will result in destruction of the nation and captivity among the nations, God will one day restore the people from that captivity. The question such a promise raises is whether God is really capable of doing that. The oracles against the nations demonstrate that the God of Israel knows the future of each of the nations and that they are ultimately accountable to him. They are in his hand, not he in theirs, as is true of the idols. Therefore, he can deliver his people whenever he chooses.<\/p>     <p>\u2003(2) These chapters also introduce a subdivision of the book I have labeled \u201cLessons in Trust\u201d (chs. 13\u201335). In these chapters Isaiah is seeking to show Hezekiah and his generation the foolishness of trusting the nations and the great wisdom of trusting the Lord. The first part of that subdivision, the oracles against the nations, raises the question: \u201cWhy would you trust any of the nations instead of the Lord when all the nations are subject to him and some of them will actually turn to him in faith before history closes?\u201d<\/p>     <p>\u2003The last oracle is addressed to Tyre, the great Phoenician (Canaanite) seaport located on the east coast of the Mediterranean Sea, about one hundred miles northwest of Jerusalem. As Babylon, with which the series began, was the great commercial power on the east of the ancient Near Eastern world, Tyre was the commercial power on the west. The Phoenicians, living roughly where the modern nation of Lebanon is located today, were pretty much forced to become a seafaring nation by their geography. The Lebanon mountain range runs parallel to the coast at this point, with fingers of the range extending right to the water\u2019s edge. This means that both east\u2013west and north\u2013south travel by land is difficult.<\/p>     <p>\u2003But this geography also means that in the bays created by the fingers of the mountain range were some excellent ports. When we remember that in ancient times the Lebanon mountains were covered with forests, it becomes easy to see how the Phoenicians got into the business of freighting lumber first to lumber-starved Egypt and then to other parts of the ancient world. From there, Phoenician mastery of the Mediterranean Sea seemed limitless. We remember that Carthage, which battled Rome for supremacy in the third and second centuries <small>B.C.<\/small>, was a Phoenician colony. Sidon, located about twenty-five miles north of Tyre, was another important Phoenician port. These two cities vied with each other for control of the trade. The present oracle seems to include Sidon in the judgment along with Tyre (23:2, 4, 12). Tyre, being closer to Israel, was more important to Israel for trade.<\/p>     ",
