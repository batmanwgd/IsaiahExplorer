    "html": "<p> The people have already indicated by \u05e2\u05dc\u05be\u05db\u05bc\u05df in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODEwXQ==\">Isaiah 59:9<\/a> that this benighted, hopeless state is the consequence of their prevailing sins; they now come back to this, and strike the note of penitence (<em> viddui <\/em> ), which is easily recognised by the recurring rhymes <em> a\u0304nu <\/em> and <em> e\u0302nu <\/em> . The prophet makes the confession (as in <a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 14:19-20<\/a>, cf., <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzI5XQ==\">Isaiah 3:21<\/a>.), standing at the head of the people as the leader of their prayer (<em> ba\u201bal <\/em> <em> t e philla\u0302h <\/em> ): <em> \u201cFor our transgressions are many before Thee, and our sins testify against us; for our transgressions are known to us, and our evil deeds well known: apostasy and denial of Jehovah, and turning back from following our God, oppressive and false speaking, receiving and giving out from the heart words of falsehood.\u201d<\/em> The people acknowledge the multitude and magnitude of their apostate deeds, which are the object of the omniscience of God, and their sins which bear witness against them ( \u05e2\u05e0\u05ea\u05d4 the predicate of a neuter plural; Ges. \u00a7146, 3). The second \u05db\u05bc\u05d9 resumes the first: \u201cour apostate deeds are with us ( \u05d0\u05ea as in <a class=\"ref\">Job 12:3<\/a>; cf., \u05e2\u05dd , <a class=\"ref\">Job 15:9<\/a>), i.e., we are conscious of them; and our misdeeds, we know them\u201d ( \u05d9\u05d3\u05e2\u05e0\u05d5\u05bc\u05dd for \u05d9\u05d3\u05e2\u05e0\u05d5\u05df , as in <a class=\"ref\">Genesis 41:21<\/a>, cf., <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODA5XQ==\">Isaiah 59:8<\/a>, and with \u05e2 , as is always the case with verbs \u05dc \u05e2 before \u05e0 , and with a suffix; Ewald, \u00a7\u00a760). The sins are now enumerated in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODE0XQ==\">Isaiah 59:13<\/a> in abstract infinitive forms. At the head stands apostasy in thought and deed, which is expressed as a threefold sin. \u05d1\u05bc\u05d4 (of Jehovah) belongs to both the \u201capostasy\u201d (treachery; e.g., <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NjU3XQ==\">Isaiah 1:2<\/a>) and the \u201cdenial\u201d (<a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 5:12<\/a>). \u05e0\u05e1\u05d5\u05d2 is an inf. abs. (different from <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 80:19<\/a>). Then follow sins against the neighbour: viz., such speaking as leads to oppression, and consists of <em> sa\u0302ra\u0302h <\/em> , that which deviates from or is opposed to the law and truth (<a class=\"ref\">Deuteronomy 19:16<\/a>); also the conception (<em> concipere <\/em> ) of lying words, and the utterance of them from the heart in which they are conceived (<a class=\"ref\">Matthew 15:18; Matthew 12:35<\/a>). \u05d4\u05e8\u05d5 and \u05d4\u05d2\u05d5 are the only <em> poel<\/em> infinitives which occur in the Old Testament, just as \u05e9\u05c1\u05d5\u05e9\u05c2\u05ea\u05d9 (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODY0XQ==\">Isaiah 10:13<\/a>) is the only example of a <em> poel perfect<\/em> of a verb \u05dc \u05d4 . The <em> po\u00ebl<\/em> is suitable throughout this passage, because the action expressed affects others, and is intended to do them harm. According to Ewald, the <em> poel<\/em> indicates the object or tendency: it is the conjugation employed to denote seeking, attacking, or laying hold of; e.g., \u05dc\u05d5\u05e9\u05c1\u05df , <em> lingua petere <\/em> , i.e., to <em> calumniate <\/em> ; \u05e2\u05d5\u05d9\u05df , <em> oculo petere <\/em> , i.e., to envy.<\/p>",
