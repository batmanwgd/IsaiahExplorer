    "html": "<p><em>The Lord sent<\/em> &mdash;Not Yahweh here, but &ldquo;Adonai.&rdquo; It is apparent that this verse is the commencement of a new prophecy, that is not connected with that which precedes it. The strain of the preceding prophecy had respect to Judah; this is confined solely to Israel, or Ephraim. Here the division of the chapter should have been made, and should not have been again interrupted until<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODU1XQ==\">Isaiah 10:4<\/a> , where the prophecy closes. The prophecy is divided into four parts, and each part is designed to threaten a distinct judgment on some particular, prominent vice.<\/p><p>I. &ldquo;Crime&rdquo;&mdash;their pride and ostentation,<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzgzOCI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 9:8-9<\/a> . &ldquo;Punishment&rdquo;&mdash;the land would be invaded by the Syrians and the Philistines,<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzg0MSI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 9:11-12<\/a> .<\/p><p>II. &ldquo;Crime&rdquo;&mdash;they had apostatized from God, and the leaders had caused them to err,<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODQzXQ==\">Isaiah 9:13<\/a> ,<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODQ2XQ==\">Isaiah 9:16<\/a> . &ldquo;Punishment&rdquo;&mdash;Yahweh would cut off the chief men of the nation,<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzg0NCI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 9:14-15<\/a> ,<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODQ3XQ==\">Isaiah 9:17<\/a> .<\/p><p>III. &ldquo;Crime&rdquo;&mdash;prevalent wickedness in the nation,<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODQ4XQ==\">Isaiah 9:18<\/a> . &ldquo;Punishment&rdquo;&mdash;the anger of Yahweh, consternation, anarchy, discord, and want,<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzg0OSI6M30=\">Isaiah 9:19-21<\/a> .<\/p><p>IV. &ldquo;Crime&rdquo;&mdash;prevalent injustice;<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzg1MiI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 10:1-2<\/a> . &ldquo;Punishment&rdquo;&mdash;foreign invasion, and captivity;<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzg1NCI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 10:3-4<\/a> .<\/p><p>The poem is remarkably regular in its structure (Lowth), and happy in its illustrations. At what time it was composed is not certain, but it has strong internal evidence that it immediately followed the preceding respecting Judah.<\/p><p><em>A word<\/em> &mdash;A message, or prediction; Note,<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3Njg3XQ==\">Isaiah 2:1<\/a> .<\/p><p><em>Into Jacob<\/em> &mdash;Jacob was the ancestor of the nation. But the name came to be appropriated to the ten tribes, as constituting the majority of the people. It was at first used to denote all the Jews<a class=\"ref\">Numbers 23:7, Numbers 23:10, Numbers 23:23; Numbers 24:17, Numbers 24:19; Deuteronomy 32:9; 1 Chronicles 16:13; Psalm 14:7; Psalm 20:1<\/a> ; but it came, after the revolt of the ten tribes under Jeroboam, to be used often to denote them alone;<a class=\"ref\">Amos 6:8; Micah 1:5; Micah 3:1; Micah 5:8<\/a> . The word or message which was sent, refers undoubtedly to that which immediately follows.<\/p><p><em>And it hath lighted upon<\/em> &mdash;Hebrew &lsquo;It fell.&rsquo; This is but a varied expression for, he sent it to Israel.<\/p><p><em>Israel<\/em> &mdash;The same as Jacob the ten tribes&mdash;the kingdom of Ephraim.<\/p> ",
