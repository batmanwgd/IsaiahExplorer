    "html": "<p>When Jehovah removes the veil of mortality in the millennial age ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODEyNiI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 25:7-8<\/a>), people&rsquo;s vision extends to things beyond their current experience. The spirits of persons in the Perdition category will be visible in the Pit of Dissolution: &ldquo;Tophet has been prepared of old, [a hearth] indeed, made ready for rulers; broad and deep is its fire pit and ample its pyre; Jehovah&rsquo;s breath burns within it like a river of lava&rdquo; ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MjUxXQ==\">Isaiah 30:33<\/a>; cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3OTQ0LDE4NDA5XQ==\">14:15; 38:18<\/a>). Their de-creation&mdash;as the &ldquo;worms&rdquo; and &ldquo;fire&rdquo; consume those who die this second death ( <a class=\"ref\">Revelation 21:8<\/a>)&mdash;remains a solemn warning to all humanity.<\/p> ",
