    "html": "<p><a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 42:25<\/a>.<i>Therefore he hath poured upon him the fury, <\/i>&c. \u2014 Most grievous judgments. <i>It hath set him on fire round about <\/i>\u2014 This was literally fulfilled when the Chaldean army took their city, and burned both it and their temple. <i>Yet he knew <\/i>it <i>not <\/i>\u2014 Considered it not: they were secure and stupid under God\u2019s judgments; neither fearing them when threatened, nor truly sensible of God\u2019s hand in them, of the causes of God\u2019s displeasure, or of the means of cure. The reader will easily observe, that \u201cthe force and elegance of the metaphor in this verse are very great. Of all natural evils which affect the human mind, which arouse and awaken it, none do so with greater quickness than fire, than a mighty flame encompassing a man on every side. No sleep, no lethargy is so great, which this will not shake off; and yet the stupor and insensibility of the Jews are here represented to be so great, that in the midst of the fire and flame, which they might and ought to think kindled by God, they inquired not into the causes of this judgment. They knew them not, nor considered them; but, persisting in their impenitence and stupidity, applied not to God in faith and repentance, nor humbled themselves before him.\u201d See Vitringa. <\/p>",
