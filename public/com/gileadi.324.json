Although there are among them those who will not believe it, some do believe. Consequently, Jehovah empowers (1) his servant&mdash;a <em>stone<\/em> or seer who acts as antidote to the erring seers (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzQ4XQ==\">v 7<\/a>); and (2) the archtyrant and his alliance&mdash;the <em>hail<\/em> and &ldquo;waters&rdquo; that flood the hiding place (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzQzLDE3OTk2LDE4Mjc5XQ==\">v 2; Isaiah 17:12; 32:19<\/a>). This results in a reconstruction of Jehovah&rsquo;s people based on justice&mdash;as carried out by Jehovah&rsquo;s exemplar of <em>righteousness<\/em> (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODQ1NF0seyIxODQ4MiI6NH1d\">Isaiah 41:2; 42:1-4<\/a>)&mdash;and in the demise of the mockers.<\/p>",
