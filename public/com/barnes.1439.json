The Jews had now no other refuge but God, and as long as they put their confidence there, even Rabshakeh knew that it was hazardous to attempt to take and destroy their city. It was his policy, therefore, first to endeavor to undermine their reliance on God, before he could have any hope of success. The enemies of God&rsquo;s people cannot succeed in their designs against them until they can unsettle their confidence in Him.<\/p> ",
