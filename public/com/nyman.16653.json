Indeed, this rejoicing will be found in all the cities of peace and righteousness where Israel, the Lord's people, dwell. So the passage has reference to more than the two great capitals, Zion and Jerusalem; this prophecy includes the many holy places of Zion and her stakes, where all the righteous Saints will have gathered in preparation for the Millennium. The joy these righteous people are to experience will come because whatever they ask for will be given them, and Satan will have no more power over them. There will be no weeping or sorrow, because there will be no death. (See <a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 101:27-29<\/a>.)<\/p>     ",
