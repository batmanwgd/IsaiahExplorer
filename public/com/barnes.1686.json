    "html": "<p><em>They lavish gold<\/em>&mdash;The word used here means properly to shake out; and then to pour out abundantly, or in a lavish manner. It is used in connection with the idea of squandering in <a class=\"ref\">Deuteronomy 21:20; Proverbs 23:21; Proverbs 28:7<\/a>. Here the idea is, that they spared no expense; they poured out gold as if it were vile and worthless, in order to make an idol. The design of this verse is, to show the superstition of those who were idolaters; and, particularly, how much they were willing to devote in order to maintain idol-worship.<\/p><p><em>Out of the bag<\/em>&mdash;They pour their gold out of the bag, or purse, where they have kept it; that is, they lavish it freely.<\/p><p><em>And weigh silver in the balance<\/em>&mdash;Perhaps the idea is here, that they used silver so lavishly that they did not wait to count it, but weighed it as they would the grosser metals. The word used here and translated &lsquo;balance&rsquo; (\u05e7\u05e0\u05d4 qa\u0302neh), means properly &ldquo;cane, reed, calamus&rdquo;; then a measuring reed or rod <a class=\"ref\">Ezekiel 40:3, Ezekiel 40:5<\/a>; then a rod, or beam of a balance, or scales (Greek &zeta;&upsilon;&gamma;&omicron;\u0300&sigmaf; zugos).<\/p><p><em>And hire a goldsmith<\/em>&mdash;(See the notes at <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODQ0MCI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 40:19-20<\/a>).<\/p><p><em>And he maketh it a god<\/em>&mdash;The goldsmith manufactures the gold and the silver into an image. The object of the prophet is to deride the custom of offering divine homage to a god formed in this manner (see the notes at <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODU0MyI6MTF9\">Isaiah 44:9-19<\/a>).<\/p> ",
