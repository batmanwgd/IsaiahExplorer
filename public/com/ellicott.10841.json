I cannot speak), and power was given him. Isaiah desired purity, and his prayer also was answered. <\/p> \n <p>Thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged.\u2014The clauses express the two elements of the great change which men, according to their varying systems, have called Conversion, the New Birth, Regeneration; but which is at all times a necessary stage in the perfecting of the saints of God. Pardon and purity are the conditions alike of the prophet\u2019s work and of the completeness of his own spiritual life. <\/p> ",
