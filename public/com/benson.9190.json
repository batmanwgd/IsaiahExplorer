Homer (<i>Odyss., 21:<\/i>,6) describes the key of Ulysses\u2019s storehouse as <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u03b5\u03c5\u03ba\u03b1\u03bc\u03c0\u03b7\u03c2<\/span>, a large curvature, which Eustathius explains by saying it was <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u03b4\u03c1\u03b5\u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03b5\u03b9\u03b4\u03b7\u03c2<\/span>, in shape like a reap-hook. Huetius says, the constellation Cassiopeia answers to this description; the stars to the north making the curve part, that is, the principal part of the key; the southern stars the handle. The curve part was introduced into the key-hole, and, being properly directed by the handle, took hold of the bolts within, and moved them from their places. We may easily collect from this account, that such a key would lie very well upon the shoulder; that it must be of some considerable size and weight, and could hardly be commodiously carried otherwise. In allusion to the key as the ensign of power, the unlimited extent of that power is expressed here with great clearness as well as force by the sole and exclusive authority to <i>open<\/i>, and to <i>shut.<\/i>, Our Saviour, therefore, has, upon a similar occasion, made use of a like manner of expression, <a class=\"ref\">Matthew 16:19<\/a>; and in <a class=\"ref\">Revelation 3:7<\/a>, has applied to himself the very words of the prophet.\u201d <\/p>",
