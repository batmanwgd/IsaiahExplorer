    "html": "<p> When Jehovah has thus acknowledged His people once more, the heathen, to whose <em> giddu\u0304ph\u0131\u0304m <\/em> (blasphemies) Israel has hitherto been given up, will count it the greatest honour to belong to Jehovah and His people. <em> \u201cOne will say, I belong to Jehovah; and a second will solemnly name the name of Jacob; and a third will inscribe himself to Jehovah, and name the name of Israel with honour.\u201d<\/em> The threefold <em> zeh <\/em> refers to the heathen, as in <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 87:4-5<\/a>. One will declare himself to belong to Jehovah; another will call with the name of Jacob, i.e., (according to the analogy of the phrase \u05d4 \u05d1\u05e9\u05c1\u05dd \u05e7\u05e8\u05d0 ) make it the medium and object of solemn exclamation; a third will write with his hand ( \u05d9\u05d3\u05d5 , an acc. of more precise definition, like \u05d7\u05de\u05d4 in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NTA2XQ==\">Isaiah 42:25<\/a>, and \u05d6\u05d1\u05d9\u05d7 \u05da in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NTI5XQ==\">Isaiah 43:23<\/a>), \u201cTo Jehovah,\u201d thereby attesting that he desires to belong to Jehovah, and Jehovah alone. This is the explanation given by Gesenius, Hahn, and others; whereas Hitzig and Knobel follow the lxx in the rendering, \u201che will write upon his hand '<em> \u201b lay e ho\u0304va\u0302h <\/em> ,' i.e., mark the name of Jehovah upon it.\u201d But apart from the fact that <em> ka\u0302thabh <\/em> , with an accusative of the writing materials, would be unprecedented (the construction required would be \u05e2\u05dc\u05be\u05d9\u05d3\u05d5 ), this view is overthrown by the fact that tatooing was prohibited by the Israelitish law (<a class=\"ref\">Leviticus 19:28<\/a>; compare the mark of the beast in <a class=\"ref\">Revelation 13:16<\/a>). \u05d1\u05e9\u05c1\u05dd \u05e7\u05e8\u05d0 is interchanged with \u05d1\u05e1\u05dd \u05db\u05bc\u05e0\u05bc\u05d4 , to surname, or entitle (the Syriac and Arabic are the same; compare the Arabic <em> kunye <\/em> , the name given to a man as the father of such and such a person, e.g., <em> Abu-Muhammed<\/em> , rhetorically called metonymy). The name <em> Israel<\/em> becomes a name or title of honour among the heathen. This concludes the fourth prophecy, which opens out into three distinct fields. With \u05d5\u05e2\u05ea\u05bc\u05d4 in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NTM1XQ==\">Isaiah 44:1<\/a> it began to approach the close, just as the third did in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NTA3XQ==\">Isaiah 43:1<\/a> -a well-rounded whole, which leaves nothing wanting.<\/p>",
