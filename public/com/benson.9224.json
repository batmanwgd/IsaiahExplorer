The Moabites, having been constant and implacable enemies to Israel, are here put for all the enemies of God\u2019s church, as the Edomites upon the same account are, chap. 34:6, and 63:1. <i>Even as straw is trodden down<\/i>\u2014Even as easily and effectually as the straw, left upon the ground, is trampled upon by the feet of men and beasts.<\/p> ",
