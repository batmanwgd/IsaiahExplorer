    "html": "<p>The lesser portion of Jehovah&rsquo;s word proves fatefully insufficient to save &ldquo;these people&rdquo;&mdash;Jehovah&rsquo;s alienated people&mdash;from being slain and taken captive by their enemies (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg3NTYiOjJ9XQ==\">vv 2-3, 13, 22<\/a>). The only way that remains for Jehovah to speak to his people that may induce them to repent is through the &ldquo;incomprehensible speech&rdquo; and &ldquo;strange tongue&rdquo; of the alien Assyrian invaders (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgyOTgiOjJ9LHsiMTg3NDAiOjJ9XQ==\">Isaiah 33:18-19; 54:16-17<\/a>). Assuming that the lesser law they labor under is, in fact, the whole law, Jehovah&rsquo;s people who have grown &ldquo;weary&rdquo; of it now reject Jehovah&rsquo;s &ldquo;rest&rdquo; and &ldquo;respite&rdquo; that characterize his higher law.<\/p>",
