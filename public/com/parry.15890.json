The children are those who gather to the restored gospel.<\/p> <p><i>nursed at thy side.<\/i> Those who gather to Zion will be supported or held firm, as a nurse would assist a patient or even carry someone in the arms or on the hip, as one would do with a child (49:22; 66:12). The implication is that those who gather will be lovingly cared for and strengthened by those in Zion.<\/p> ",
