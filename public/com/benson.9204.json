    "html": "<p><a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MDk3XQ==\">Isaiah 24:1<\/a>.<i>Behold, <\/i>&c. \u2014 According to Vitringa, the third book of Isaiah\u2019s prophecies begins with this chapter, and extends to the thirty-sixth, being divided into three discourses; the first comprehending four chapters, the second six, and the third two. The general subject of the book is the penal judgments denounced by God upon the disobedient Jews, and the enemies of the church, with the most ample promises to the true church. This first discourse, contained in this and the three following chapters, Bishop Lowth thinks, was delivered before the destruction of Moab by Shalmaneser, (see <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTI5XQ==\">Isaiah 25:10<\/a>,) and consequently before the destruction of Samaria, and probably in the beginning of Hezekiah\u2019s reign. <i>The Lord maketh the earth empty <\/i>\u2014 The word  <span class=\"hebrew_text\">\u05d4\u05d0\u05e8\u05e6<\/span>, here translated <i>the earth, <\/i>may, with equal propriety, be rendered <i>the land, <\/i>as indeed it is in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MDk5XQ==\">Isaiah 24:3<\/a>; <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTA5XQ==\">Isaiah 24:13<\/a> of this chapter, and very frequently elsewhere. The land of Canaan seems to be here meant, including both Israel and Judah, which was made empty when the inhabitants of it were carried into captivity, which they were, first by the Assyrians, and then by the Chaldeans. And it was made still more empty and desolate in the last and great destruction of its cities and people, particularly of Jerusalem and its inhabitants by the Romans; of which see on <a class=\"ref\">Deuteronomy 28:62<\/a>. To this destruction especially the prophet is thought to refer in many parts of this chapter.<\/p>",
