(<a class=\"ref\">1 Kings 8:1<\/a>.) (This attack occurred in 701 b.c., under the Assyrian king Sennacherib.) Yet the Lord will punish the king of Assyria for his \"stout heart\" and \"high looks\" (arrogance, pride, and boasting). This prophecy was fulfilled when a desolating sickness was sent into the Assyrian camps, causing many deaths, and the king was later slain by his own sons.
