But by bread and water here are meant all kinds of aliment, whereby the body is supported. This judgment seems to relate especially to the siege of Jerusalem by the Chaldeans, when bread and water were both very scarce: see <a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 14:1-6; Jeremiah 37:21; Jeremiah 38:9<\/a>.<\/p> ",
