    "html": " <p>Those who survive the judgments and the destructions upon the earth, as set forth in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isa. 24<\/a>, will praise the Lord, perhaps in prayer or song. Isaiah preserves the words of a hymn of praise in these verses. The hymn includes words that bring us great comfort: Jehovah is our \"strength\" and our \"refuge from the storm\"; he is our \"shadow from the heat.\" He is always there when we need him, whether for spiritual protection or physical safety.<\/p> <blockquote> O Lord, thou art my God;<i> I will <\/i><u>exalt thee<\/u>,     <br><i>I will <\/i><u>praise thy name<\/u>;     <br><i>for thou hast done<\/i> <u>wonderful things<\/u>;     <br><i>thy counsels of old<\/i> are <u>faithfulness and truth<\/u>. (25:1)     <br>For thou hast made of a <i>city <\/i>an <u>heap<\/u>;     <br>of a defenced <i>city <\/i>a <u>ruin<\/u>:     <br>a <i>palace of strangers <\/i>to <u>be no city<\/u>;     <br>it shall never be built. (25:2)     <br>Therefore shall the <i>strong people<\/i> <u>glorify thee<\/u>,     <br>the <i>city of the terrible<\/i> nations shall <u>fear thee<\/u>. (25:3)     <br>For thou hast been <i>a strength<\/i> to <u>the poor<\/u>,     <br><i>a strength <\/i>to <u>the needy in his distress<\/u>,     <br><i>a refuge<\/i> from <u>the storm<\/u>,     <br><i>a shadow<\/i> from <u>the heat<\/u>,     <br>when the blast of the terrible ones is as a storm against the wall. (25:4)     <br>Thou shalt <i>bring down the noise<\/i> of<u> strangers<\/u>,     <br>as the heat in a dry place; even the heat with the shadow of a cloud:     <br>the [<i>song<\/i>] of <u>the terrible ones<\/u> shall <i>be brought low.<\/i> (25:5)<\/blockquote> ",
