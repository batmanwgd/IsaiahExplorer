The fruit of thy land, and all thy labours, shall a nation which thou knowest not eat up\" (<a class=\"ref\">Deut. 28:30,  33<\/a>). That cursing was renewed by later prophets (<a class=\"ref\">Amos 5:11; Micah 6:15<\/a>), but the Lord promises to bless the righteous. In the day of her salvation, Israel will enjoy the fruits of her labors.<\/p> ",
