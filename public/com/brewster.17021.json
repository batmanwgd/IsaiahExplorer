However, as the Prophet Joseph Smith worked on his inspired translation of the Bible, he made a slight alteration in verse 2, adding the phrase \"for thus hath the Lord said unto me\" after the word \"sorrow,\" and deleting the words \"me as\" between \"unto\" and \"Ariel.\" (JST Isaiah 29:2.) Ariel (the city where David dwelt) was Jerusalem. It meant \"altar of God\" or \"hearth of God.\" The hearth was the highest tier of the altar of Solomon's temple and was the place where sacrifices were consumed by fire. \"Since the term is used to describe Jerusalem in her distressed condition (the word 'Zion' replaces this term in <a class=\"ref\">2 Ne. 27:3<\/a>), it implies that Judah will need to be humbled and that God's fire of judgment will refine her.\" (IPSP, 270-71.)<\/p>     <table>         <tbody>             <tr>                 <td><b><a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 29<\/a><br><br><br>1 Woe to Ariel, to Ariel, the city where David dwelt! add ye year to year; let them kill sacrifices.<br><br>2 Yet I will distress Ariel, and there shall be heaviness and sorrow<u>: and i<\/u> t shall be unto <u>me as<\/u> Ariel<u>.<\/u><br><\/b><\/td>                 <td>JST, Isaiah 29                     <br>                     <br>                     <br>1 Woe to Ariel, to Ariel, the city where David dwelt! add ye year to year; let them kill sacrifices.                     <br>                     <br>2 Yet I will distress Ariel, and there shall be heaviness and sorrow<u>; for thus hath the Lord said unto me, I<\/u> t shall be unto Ariel<u>;<\/u>                     <br>                 <\/td>             <\/tr>         <\/tbody>     <\/table>",
