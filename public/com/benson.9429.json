For the Chaldeans in all ages were famous, or rather infamous, for the study and practice of these arts. <i>Thou art wearied in thy counsels <\/i>\u2014 Thou hast spent thy time and strength in going from one to another, in trying all manner of experiments, and all to no purpose. <i>Let<\/i> <i>now the astrologers, &c., stand up <\/i>\u2014 To succour thee, or to inquire for thee. <i>Behold, they shall be as stubble <\/i>\u2014 They shall have no more power to withstand the calamities coming upon them than stubble has to resist the violence of the fire. <i>They shall not deliver themselves from the flame <\/i>\u2014 And much less thee. <i>There shall not be a coal to warm at, <\/i>&c. \u2014 They shall be totally consumed, and all the comfort which thou didst expect from them shall utterly vanish. <i>Thus shall they be unto thee <\/i>\u2014 Such comfortless and helpless creatures, namely, thy sorcerers, astrologers, &c.; <i>with whom thou hast laboured <\/i>\u2014 Upon whom thou hast spent thy time, pains, and money; <i>even thy merchants <\/i>\u2014 Or <i>negotiators, <\/i>as Bishop Lowth translates  <span class=\"hebrew_text\">\u05e1\u05d7\u05e8\u05d9\u05df<\/span>, with whom thou hast had so much intercourse, and so many dealings. <i>They shall wander every one to his quarter <\/i>\u2014 Or, as some interpret the meaning, \u201cThey shall wander by whatsoever ways they can to the extreme boundaries of thy empire, to save themselves from the general calamity.\u201d <i>None shall save thee <\/i>\u2014 From thy impending ruin, but all shall leave thee to perish without help, and without hope. Observe, reader, they, and only they, are safe and happy, who, by faith and prayer, deal with one that will always be a present help in time of trouble to those that flee to him for refuge, and trust in him. <\/p>",
