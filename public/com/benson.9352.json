Thus the image owes all its excellence to the earth for the matter of it, and to the art of man for the fashion of it.<i> The goldsmith spreadeth it over with gold<\/i> \u2014 Beaten out into leaves or plates;<i> and casteth silver chains<\/i> \u2014 For ornaments; or rather, for use, to fasten it to a wall or pillar, lest it should fall down and be broken in pieces. Which is spoken by way of derision of such ridiculous deities as needed such supports.<i> He that hath no oblation<\/i> \u2014 That can hardly procure money to buy the meanest sacrifice;<i> chooseth a tree,<\/i> &c. \u2014 He is so mad upon his idols, that he will find money to procure the choicest materials, and the best artist to make his idol;<i> to prepare a graven image,<\/i> &c. \u2014 Which, after all this cost, cannot stir one step out of its place to give him any help.<\/p> ",
