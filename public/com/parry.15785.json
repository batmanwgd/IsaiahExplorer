    "html": " <i>taught of the Lord.<\/i> Jesus quoted these words in saying: \"No man can come to me, except he doeth the will of my Father&hellip;. And this is the will of him who hath sent me, that ye receive the Son;&hellip;It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of God. Every man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of the Father, cometh unto me\" (JST <a class=\"ref\">John 6:44-45<\/a>). It is uncertain from the context whether this phrase means that the children will be taught <i>about<\/i> the Lord or that they will be taught <i>by<\/i> the Lord\u2014perhaps both interpretations are correct. Virtually all other major English translations (including GNB, JB, NAB, NEB, NIV, NKJV, and NRSV) provide some variation of the reading, \"All thy children shall be taught <i>by<\/i> the Lord.\"<\/p> ",
