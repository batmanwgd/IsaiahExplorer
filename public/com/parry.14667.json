    "html": " <p> We recall that 1:2-5a and 10-15 feature a courtroom scene, wherein the Lord pronounces a legal decision on the house of Israel. A similar scene, also with Israel as the accused, appears in 3:13-4:1, in which once again the Lord stands as both prosecutor and judge (3:13). <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzcyMSI6NX0=\">Isa. 3:13-17<\/a> describes a heavenly courtroom scene where the Lord stands both to plead and to pronounce a judgment. The reason for the judgment is clear: \"The Lord will enter into judgment\" because the children of Israel mistreated the poor (3:14b), \"beat\" God's people (3:15), and were proud and \"haughty\" (3:16-23). The judgments of God described in 3:17-26 include the following: the Lord will smite the offenders with a scab on the head (3:17); he will take away their finery and showy materialism (3:18-24); and he will make them bald and cause them to burn, stink, wear rent clothes, fall in war, and become desolate (3:24-26). <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzczMiI6M30=\">Isa. 3:24-26<\/a> seems to indicate that the phrase \"daughters of Zion\" (3:16) speaks not just against women but against all Israel, male and female. Another possible interpretation of the object of God's prophecy is that in 3:14-15, 25, he is talking to males and in 3:16-24 he is talking to females.<\/p> <blockquote> The Lord <i>standeth<\/i> up <u>to plead<\/u>,     <br>and <i>standeth<\/i> <u>to judge<\/u> the people. (3:13)     <br>The Lord will enter into judgment with the <i>[elders] of <u>his people<\/u>,<\/i>     <br>and the <i>princes<\/i> <u>thereof<\/u>:     <br>for ye have eaten up the <i>vineyard<\/i>     <br>[and] the <i>spoil of the poor<\/i> in your houses. (3:14)     <br>What mean[ye[?] Ye <i>beat<\/i> <u>my people<\/u> to pieces,     <br>and <i>grind<\/i> the <u>faces of the poor<\/u>? saith the Lord God of hosts. (3:15)     <br>Moreover, the Lord saith, Because the daughters of Zion are haughty,     <br>and <i>walk<\/i> with <u>stretched forth necks and [flirtatious]<\/u> <u> eyes<\/u>,     <br><i>walking<\/i> [along in prancing manner], and [<u>with ornaments jingling on their ankles<\/u>]: (3:16)     <br>Therefore the <i>Lord<\/i> <u>will smite<\/u> with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion,     <br>and the <i>Lord<\/i> <u>will [uncover<\/u> their forehead]. (3:17)     <br>In that day the Lord will take away [their finery:     <br>the bangles and headbands and crescent necklaces, (3:18)     <br>the earrings and bracelets and veils, (3:19)     <br>the headdresses and ankle chains and sashes,     <br>the perfume bottles and charms, (3:20)     <br>the signet rings and nose rings, (3:21)     <br>the fine robes and the capes and cloaks,     <br>the purses (3:22) and mirrors,     <br>and the linen garments and tiaras and shawls.] (3:23)     <br>And it shall come to pass, instead of <i>[fragrance] there shall be <u>stink<\/u>;<\/i>     <br>and instead of a [<i>sash,<\/i> a <u>rope<\/u>];     <br>and instead of <i>well set hair,<\/i> <u>baldness<\/u>;     <br>and instead of a [<i>majestic<\/i> <i>robe<\/i>], a girding of <u>sackcloth<\/u>;     <br>[<u>humiliation<\/u>] instead of <i>beauty. (3:24)<\/i>     <br>Thy <i>men<\/i> shall fall by the <u>sword<\/u>     <br>and thy <i>mighty<\/i> in the <u>war<\/u>. (3:25)     <br>And <i>her [entrances] shall <u>lament and mourn<\/u>;<\/i>     <br>and <i>she<\/i> [shall be] desolate [and] shall <u>sit upon the ground<\/u>. (3:26)     <br>And in that day, seven women shall take hold of one man, saying: We will eat our own bread, and wear our own apparel; only let us be called by thy name to take away our reproach.
