History has shown that the children of God need to be constantly reminded of a seemingly obvious truth\u2014you can't find happiness <i>outside<\/i> the plan of happiness. One cannot have a life of joy while living the plan of misery.  <\/p>  <h4>How Does This Tree Help Me Today?<\/h4>  <p>  While there may appear to be a scolding tone in this chapter (as in many chapters of Isaiah), the message is clearly one of hope. The Lord is powerful, he knows all things, and he is full of love for us. It would be difficult to have faith in a God who was only \"pretty good\" at keeping his promises or who was only semitrustworthy. Instead, we worship a God who is not just fairly competent at saving His children, but is \"mighty to save\" (2 Nephi 31:19). While the most we can do is to be willing, He is able. He has the power to deliver his people from bondage. He has done so, and will do so, if we will leave the false gods of the world behind and hearken to his commandments. Through his power, we can enjoy the promise of peace (like a river) and constant righteousness (like the waves of the sea).  <\/p>  ",
