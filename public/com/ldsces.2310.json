At that day all the world will finally come to understand that wickedness never was happiness.<\/p><p>Although Moab was Israel&rsquo;s bitter enemy, Isaiah still wept over the great tragedy of her sin and resulting destruction.<\/p><p class=\"cite\">LDS Church Educational System Old Testament Student Manual, 1 Kings&ndash;Malachi, Religion 302, Chapter 14, Item 21<\/p>",
