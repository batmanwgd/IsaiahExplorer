    "html": "<p> The tyrants who usurped the rule over Israel have now utterly disappeared. <em> \u201cDead men live not again, shades do not rise again: so hast Thou visited and destroyed them, and caused all their memory to perish.\u201d<\/em> The meaning is not that Jehovah had put them to death because there was no resurrection at all after death; for, as we shall see further on, the prophet was acquainted with such a resurrection. In <em> me\u0304thim <\/em> (dead men) and <em> repha\u0302'im <\/em> (shades) he had directly in mind the oppressors of Israel, who had been thrust down into the region of the shades (like the king of Babylon in chapter 14), so that there was no possibility of their being raised up or setting themselves up again. The \u05dc\u05db\u05df is not argumentative (which would be very freezing in this highly lyrical connection), but introduces what must have occurred <em> eo ipso <\/em> when the other had taken place (it corresponds to the Greek \u03b1\u0313\u0301\u03c1\u03b1 , and is used here in the same way as in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODUxXQ==\">Isaiah 61:7<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 5:2; Jeremiah 2:33; Zechariah 11:7; Job 34:25; Job 42:3<\/a>). They had fallen irrevocably into Sheol (<a class=\"ref\">Psalms 49:15<\/a>), and consequently God had swept them away, so that not even their name was perpetuated.<\/p>",
