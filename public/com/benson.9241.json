The words may be rendered, <i>In times to come he shall cause Jacob to take root. Israel shall blossom and bud <\/i>\u2014Shall revive <i>and flourish.<\/i>, The metaphor of a vine is still pursued, and these expressions signify the increase of the Jewish people, after their return from their captivity in Babylon. <i>And fill the face of the world with fruit <\/i>\u2014Their posterity shall be so numerous that their own land shall not be sufficient for them, but they shall be forced to seek habitations in other countries, and shall replenish them with people. This prediction was indeed fulfilled after the captivity; for the Jews filled all Judea and Syria, and were spread over all the Roman empire, as appears, not only from their own histories, but from the books of the New Testament. See note on <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTQ2XQ==\">Isaiah 26:15<\/a>. But, perhaps, this is chiefly intended to be understood of the spiritual seed of Jacob, or of believers, who are often called God\u2019s Israel, as <a class=\"ref\">Romans 9:6<\/a>, and elsewhere. <\/p>",
