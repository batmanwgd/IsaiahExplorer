    "html": "<p>When the vineyard and the cucumber crops were ready to harvest, small booths, or huts, were built in the fields so the owner or his servants could watch over the harvest and protect it from thieves or animals. These huts were generally crudely made and hastily erected. After the harvest, they were abandoned and quickly became dilapidated and forlorn relics of the harvest. Jerusalem was to be like that&mdash;once proud and useful, but now, through her own spiritual neglect, an empty and forlorn relic. (See Edward J. Young, <em>The Book of Isaiah,<\/em> 1:55&ndash;56.)<\/p><p class=\"cite\"> LDS Church Educational System Old Testament Student Manual, 1 Kings&ndash;Malachi, Religion 302, Chapter 13, Item 5<\/p> ",
