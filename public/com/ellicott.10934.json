The repetition of \u201cgirdle\u201d has needlessly offended some fastidious critics, but the emphasis of iteration is quite after Isaiah\u2019s manner (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3OTY5XQ==\">Isaiah 15:8 <\/a>; <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3OTc3XQ==\">Isaiah 16:7 <\/a>; <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzk5NiI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 17:12-13 <\/a>). It perhaps implies an upper and a lower girdle as the symbol of complete equipment. In the \u201cloins girt about with truth\u201d of <a class=\"ref\">Ephesians 6:14 <\/a>,, we may probably trace an allusive reference.
