The new shoot of the fallen tree of Jesse is to grow up like a stately palm, seen afar off upon the heights of the \u201choly mountain,\u201d a signal round which the distant nations might rally as their centre. So the name of \u201cthe root of David\u201d is applied to the glorified Christ in <a class=\"ref\">Revelation 5:5; Revelation 22:16<\/a>. The word for \u201cseek\u201d implies, as in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODI3LDE4MDA4LDE4NzQ3XQ==\">Isaiah 8:19; Isaiah 19:3; Isaiah 55:6<\/a>, the special seeking for wisdom and illumination. <\/p>\n <p>His rest shall be glorious.\u2014Better, his resting-place shall be glory; i.e., he shall abide evermore in the eternal glory which is the dwelling-place of Jehovah. <\/p>",
