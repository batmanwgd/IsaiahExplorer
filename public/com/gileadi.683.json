    "html": "<p>A millennial ascent phase &ldquo;of generation after generation&rdquo; follows a centuries-long descent phase for many of Jehovah&rsquo;s people. The antithetical themes of Isaiah&rsquo;s Seven-Part Structure now find resolution as ruin gives way to rebirth, punishment to deliverance, humiliation to exaltation, suffering to salvation, and disinheritance to inheritance&mdash;all contingent on rebellion yielding to compliance and disloyalty to loyalty. In the end, those who ascend &ldquo;know&rdquo; their Savior and Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">v 14<\/a>) and Valiant One of Jacob. Having become like him, they live in his glorious presence.<\/p><p>Word links show that the kings who reign with Jehovah in the millennial age of peace are those same spiritual kings and their queens on the seraph level who serve as proxy saviors to Jehovah&rsquo;s people under the terms of the Davidic Covenant (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODg1OF0seyIxODg2NSI6Mn0sWzE4MjYxLDE4NjQ0LDE4NjYwLDE4NzEyXV0=\">vv 3, 10-11, 16-17; Isaiah 32:1; 49:7, 23; 52:15<\/a>). Such come to &ldquo;know&rdquo; Jehovah through their sacrifice of all things in his cause (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODAyNiI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 19:21-22<\/a>). They fulfill Zechariah&rsquo;s prophecy that &ldquo;the house of David will be as God, as the angel of Jehovah before them&rdquo; to defend his people (<a class=\"ref\">Zechariah 12:8<\/a>; cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NjgzLDE4NzQ0LDE4Nzk1XQ==\">Isaiah 51:9; 55:3; 58:8<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\">Matthew 24:31; Revelation 20:6<\/a>).<\/p>",
