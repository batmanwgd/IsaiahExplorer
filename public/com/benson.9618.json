They shall minister in holy things, preside in the religious assemblies, teach the people, and bless in the name of the Lord. They shall <i>be stewards of the mysteries of God,<\/i>, as the priests and Levites were under the law; angels or messengers of the churches, pastors overseeing and feeding their several flocks, elders, presbyters, or bishops, giving themselves to the word of God and prayer, (<a class=\"ref\">Acts 6:2-4<\/a>,) and wholly occupied in these holy duties. The apostles were all Jews, and so were the seventy disciples; the great apostle of the Gentiles was himself a <i>Hebrew of the Hebrews.<\/i>, But when churches were planted among the Gentiles, they had ministers appointed them who were, <i>of themselves, elders in every church,<\/i>, <a class=\"ref\">Acts 14:23; Titus 1:5<\/a>; which made the ministry to spread the more easily, and to be the more familiar, and, if not the more venerable, yet the more acceptable. God saith, <i>I will take,<\/i>, not <i>all them,<\/i>, though they are all, in a spiritual sense, made to our God <i>kings and priests,<\/i>, but <i>of them,<\/i>, that is, some of them. It is God\u2019s work to <i>choose ministers,<\/i>, by qualifying them for, and inclining them to, the service, as well as to <i>make ministers,<\/i>, by giving them their commission. <i>I will take them <\/i>\u2014That is, I will admit them, though Gentiles, and will accept of them and their ministrations. This is a great honour and advantage to the Gentile Church, as it was to the Jewish Church, that God <i>raised up of their sons for prophets,<\/i>, and <i>their young men for Nazarites,<\/i>, <a class=\"ref\">Amos 2:11<\/a>. <\/p>",
