But it is evidently mere conjecture, and is not demanded. The word &lsquo;yea&rsquo; will express the sense, meaning that desolation, indicated by the growth of thorns and briers, would come upon the cities that were then filled with joy. This does not refer to Jerusalem, which was not taken by Sennacherib, but to the other cities that were destroyed by him in his march, and this account accords with the statement in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 7:20-25<\/a>.<\/p>",
