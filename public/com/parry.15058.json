Isaiah selects his terms well; Judah relied on the waters that originated from the ground (Hezekiah's Tunnel) but rejected Jehovah, the \"waters of Shiloah that go softly\" (8:6) and the \"fountain of living waters\" (<a class=\"ref\">Jer. 2:13; 17:13<\/a>; <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MzAxXQ==\">Isa. 33:21<\/a>). <\/p> ",
