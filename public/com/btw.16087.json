We will recognize the joy of having a Savior, and we will want to praise his name and declare it among the people. We can experience this kind of joy not just in the Millennium but whenever we consider what great things the Lord has done for us, what great things he has done for our fathers, and what great things he will do in the millennial day.  <\/p>  ",
