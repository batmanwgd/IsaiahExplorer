Details regarding his reign are recorded in <a class=\"ref\">2 Kgs. 15:1-7<\/a> (in which his name is rendered <i>Azariah<\/i>) and <a class=\"ref\">2 Chr. 26<\/a>. It is evident in this verse that Isaiah wants his readers to note that he received a vision of the heavenly king in the same year the earthly king died.<\/p> <p><i>throne.<\/i> Isaiah saw the throne room (the holy of holies) of the temple in heaven. (For prophetic descriptions of the heavenly throne, see <a class=\"ref\">Ezek. 1:26, Rev. 4:2-5<\/a>, and <a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 137:3<\/a>.) <\/p> <p><i>high and lifted up.<\/i> God is greater and more exalted than all creatures. Elsewhere Isaiah calls God \"the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity\" (57:15).<\/p> <p> <i>hems of his robe.<\/i> This speaks of the Lord's flowing temple robes. God is \"clothed with purity, yea, even with the robe of righteousness\" (<a class=\"ref\">2 Ne. 9:14<\/a>), as are his holy saints. The image of the hems of God's robe filling the temple is used to symbolize the purity, righteousness, and power of the Lord that filled the temple.<\/p> <p><i>temple.<\/i> The temple in heaven was likely accessed through the earthly temple, which in Isaiah's case was located in Jerusalem.<\/p> ",
