The music which is usually associated with the alcoholic beverages is not that which invites the Spirit of the Lord, nor do those who operate drinking establishments regard the Lord's work or even his presence m the universe. Verse 13 notes the universal effect alcohol has in bringing captivity upon a nation. Both the honorable men (the leaders) and the multitude (the constituents) lose the knowledge of God and his work. Famine and thirst for the word of God (also described in <a class=\"ref\">Amos 8:11-12<\/a>) come upon the land, causing those who depart this life for the next to swell the numbers in hell. However, God's judgments will destroy these iniquitous places and leave the isolated cities to become grazing lands for sheep.<\/p>     ",
