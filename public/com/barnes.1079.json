    "html": "<p><em>The cities of Aroer<\/em>&mdash;By &ldquo;Aroer&rdquo; here seems to be meant a tract or region of country pertaining to Damascus, in which were situated several cities. Grotius supposes that it was a tract of country in Syria which is called by Ptolemy &ldquo;Aueira&rdquo;&mdash;&Alpha;&upsilon;\u0313\u0301&epsilon;&iota;&rho;&alpha; Aueira. Vitringa supposes that one part of Damascus is meant by this, as Damascus was divided by the river in the same manner that Babylon was. There were several cities of the name of &ldquo;Aroer.&rdquo; One was on the river Arnon in the land of Moab <a class=\"ref\">Deuteronomy 2:36; Deuteronomy 3:12; Joshua 12:3<\/a>. Burckhardt found this city under the name of Aroer. There was another city of this name further north, over against Rabbath-Ammon <a class=\"ref\">Joshua 13:25<\/a>. There was a third city of this name in the tribe of Judah <a class=\"ref\">1 Samuel 30:28<\/a>. Of the city of Araayr which Burckhardt visited, nothing is now remarkable but its entire desolation. Gesenius supposes (&ldquo;Commentary in loc.&rdquo;) that the phrase &lsquo;the cities of Aroer&rsquo; means the cities round about Aroer, and that were connected with it, similar to the phrase &lsquo;daughters of a city.&rsquo; This city he supposes was near the river Arnon, within the limits of Moab, and that the prediction here was fufilled by Tiglath-pileser, when he carried away the inhabitants of Galilee, Gilead, and other places mentioned in <a class=\"ref\">2 Kings 15:29<\/a>. There can be no doubt that it was under the jurisdiction of Damascus.<\/p><p><em>Are forsaken<\/em>&mdash;Are desolate, and the inhabitants have fled.<\/p><p><em>They shall be for flocks...<\/em>&mdash;(See the note at <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzU3XQ==\">Isaiah 5:17<\/a>.)<\/p>",
