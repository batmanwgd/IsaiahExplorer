    "html": " <p>The Lord challenges the false gods and graven images that the people have created for themselves to prophesy and foretell the future. He asks the false gods to relate a few historical facts, and he invites them to perform any kind of act\u2014a good act or even an evil act. The Lord issues these challenges so that the people who created these graven images may see if their images are indeed gods, possessing powers and life within themselves. The false gods, of course, are unable to respond, because they are nothing more than \"wind and confusion.\" Whoever makes a graven image is an \"abomination\" and \"vanity.\"<\/p> <blockquote> <i>Produce your cause,<\/i> <u>saith the Lord<\/u>;     <br><i>bring forth your strong reasons,<\/i> <u>saith the King of Jacob <\/u><i>.<\/i> (41:21)     <br>Let them bring them forth,     <br>and [<i>show<\/i>] us <u>what shall happen<\/u>:     <br>let them [<i>show<\/i>] <u>the former things<\/u><i>,<\/i> what they be,     <br>that we may <i>consider<\/i> them, and <i>know<\/i> <u>the latter end of them<\/u>;     <br>or <i>declare<\/i> us <u>things for to come<\/u><i>.<\/i> (41:22)     <br>[<i>Show<\/i>] the <u>things that are to come hereafter<\/u><i>,<\/i>     <br>that we may know that ye are gods:     <br>yea, do good, or do evil, that we may be dismayed, and behold it together.
