It probably rests on the thought that the whole land was holy (<a class=\"ref\">Zechariah 2:12<\/a>), and that this attribute extended, therefore, to all its cities, especially to those which were connected with historical memories. Possibly, however, Zion and Jerusalem\u2014the former identified with the Temple, the latter with the people of Jehovah\u2014are thought of as two distinct cities, locally united. The \u201cwilderness\u201d is, as elsewhere, rather open pasture-land than a sandy desert. <\/p> ",
