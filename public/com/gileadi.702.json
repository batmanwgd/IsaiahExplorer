    "html": "<p>As Jehovah&rsquo;s coming to the earth has the dual aspects of redemption for the righteous and vengeance upon the wicked ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODcxXQ==\">v 4<\/a>), the outcome for all peoples depends on how they respond to his atonement for their transgressions. Although Jehovah pays &ldquo;the price of our peace&rdquo; or salvation, his people can&rsquo;t be &ldquo;healed by his wounds&rdquo; until they repent ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzE3XQ==\">Isaiah 53:5<\/a>; cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxNzc4MF0seyIxODU1NSI6Mn0sWzE4ODIxXV0=\">6:10; 44:21-22; 59:20<\/a>). Because mercy can&rsquo;t rob justice, there exist laws or conditions that govern their operation: while Jehovah&rsquo;s people who repent receive his forgiveness, those who remain in their sins must suffer the justice of a just God.<\/p><p>Even so, Jehovah doesn&rsquo;t inflict on them the consequences of their transgressions that he doesn&rsquo;t himself suffer on their behalf when redeeming them: &ldquo;He bore our sufferings, endured our griefs, though we thought him stricken, smitten of God, and humbled. But he was pierced for our transgressions, crushed because of our iniquities; the price of our peace he incurred, and with his wounds we are healed.... By arrest and trial he was taken away. Who can apprise his generation that he was cut off from the land of the living for the crime of my people, to whom the blow was due?&rdquo; ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg3MTYiOjJ9LHsiMTg3MTYiOjJ9LFsxODcyMF1d\">Isaiah 53:4-5, Isaiah 53:4-5, 8<\/a>).<\/p><p>Jehovah&rsquo;s red-stained garments are thus first those stained by his own blood when he atones for his people&rsquo;s transgressions by going like &ldquo;a lamb to the slaughter&rdquo; ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzE5XQ==\">Isaiah 53:7<\/a>). That gives him the twofold prerogative as their God to impose justice on the wicked when he comes to the earth in power ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDMxXQ==\">Isaiah 40:10<\/a>). To that end, he raises up two instruments of his power: (1) the king of Assyria\/Babylon&mdash;his<em>anger<\/em> , <em>wrath<\/em> , <em>vengeance<\/em> , and<em>rage<\/em> ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg4NzAiOjR9LHsiMTc4NTYiOjJ9LFsxNzkxNiwxODMwNl1d\">vv 3-6; Isaiah 10:5-6; 13:9; 34:2<\/a>); and (2) the servant&mdash;his<em>arm<\/em> of<em>righteousness<\/em> ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODQ1NF0seyIxODYyOSI6Mn0sWzE4NjgzXV0=\">Isaiah 41:2; 48:14-15; 51:9<\/a>) whom he &ldquo;announces&rdquo; ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODQ1NiwxODU4MV0seyIxODU5OCI6M31d\">Isaiah 41:4; 45:19; 46:11-13<\/a>).<\/p><p>The names Edom and Bozrah and the idea of &ldquo;a day of vengeance&rdquo; and &ldquo;the year of my redeemed&rdquo; ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODcxXQ==\">v 4<\/a>) establish word links to another passage: &ldquo;When my sword drinks its fill in the heavens, it shall come down on Edom in judgment, on the people I have sentenced to damnation. Jehovah has a sword that shall engorge with blood and glut itself with fat&mdash;the blood of lambs and he-goats, the kidney fat of rams. For Jehovah will hold a slaughter in Bozrah, an immense massacre in the land of Edom.... For it is Jehovah&rsquo;s day of vengeance, the year of retribution on behalf of Zion&rdquo; ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgzMDkiOjJ9LHsiMTgzMDkiOjJ9LFsxODMxMl1d\">Isaiah 34:5-6, Isaiah 34:5-6, 8<\/a>).<\/p><p>Jehovah&rsquo;s judgment on Edom, however, is a judgment on all nations or Gentiles: &ldquo;Let the earth give heed, and all who are upon it, the world, and all who spring from it. Jehovah&rsquo;s rage is upon all nations, his fury upon all their hosts; he has doomed them, consigned them to the slaughter&rdquo; ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODMwNSI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 34:1-2<\/a>). The name Edom, which designates Esau, Jacob&rsquo;s brother ( <a class=\"ref\">Genesis 25:30<\/a>), alludes to those who, like Esau, sell their birthright for a mess of pottage. These go &ldquo;to the slaughter&rdquo; as Jehovah himself goes &ldquo;to the slaughter&rdquo; when he atones for humanity&rsquo;s transgressions and becomes its Savior ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzE5XQ==\">Isaiah 53:7<\/a>).<\/p> ",
