Behold, all ye that kindle a fire <\/i>\u2014 That you may enjoy the light and comfort of it; you that reject the light which God hath set up, and seek for comfort and safety in your own inventions: which was the common error of the Jews in all ages, and especially in the days of the Messiah, when they refused him, and that way of salvation which he appointed, and rested on their own traditions and devices, <i>going about to establish their own righteousness, and not submitting themselves unto the righteousness of God. That compass yourselves with sparks <\/i>\u2014 Of your own kindling. Dr. Waterland and Bishop Lowth translate this latter clause, \u201cwho place, or heap the fuel around.\u201d <i>Walk in the light of your fire, and in the sparks that ye have kindled <\/i>\u2014 Use your utmost endeavours to get comfort from these devices. <i>This shall ye have of my hand, <\/i>&c \u2014 This shall be the fruit of all, through my just judgment, that, instead of that comfort and security which you expect by these means, you shall receive nothing but vexation and misery, which shall pursue you both living and dying; for the word  <span class=\"hebrew_text\">\u05e9\u05c1\u05db\u05d1<\/span>, here rendered <i>lie down, <\/i>is frequently used for <i>dying, <\/i>as <a class=\"ref\">Genesis 47:30; Job 21:26<\/a>, and elsewhere. <\/p>",
