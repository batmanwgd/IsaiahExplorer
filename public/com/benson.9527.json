Or ought not such a fast to be accompanied with such things as these? He now proceeds to show the concomitants of a true fast; namely, to exercise works of justice and charity. <i>To loose the bands of wickedness <\/i>\u2014Namely, the cruel obligations of usury and oppression. <i>To undo the heavy burdens <\/i>\u2014Hebrew, <i>the bundles of the yoke, <\/i> as in the margin; by which may possibly be intended <i>bundles of writings, acknowledgments, bonds, mortgages, <\/i> &c., which the usurers had lying by them. The former are thought to relate to unjust and unlawful obligations, extorted by force or fear, which the prophet would have cancelled: this latter, to just debts contracted through poverty and necessity, the rigour whereof he would have abated. <i>And to let the oppressed go free <\/i>\u2014Those grieved or vexed, whether by the griping of usury or the bonds of slavery, accompanied with cruel usage; or those confined or shut up in prisons; <i>and that ye break every yoke <\/i>\u2014Namely, which is grievous; that you free your dependants and servants, and all that are under your power, from all sorts of vexations and oppressions. <\/p> ",
