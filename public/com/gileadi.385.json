The verb &ldquo;behold&rdquo; (<em>hazeh<\/em>) connotes &ldquo;seeing in vision&rdquo; as did Isaiah (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NjU2LDE3OTA4XQ==\">Isaiah 1:1; 13:1<\/a>). The view&mdash;like that of seraphs&mdash;isn&rsquo;t from below but from above (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzczLDE4NDQzXQ==\">Isaiah 6:3; 40:22<\/a>). Only those who attain Isaiah&rsquo;s seraph category, therefore, are privy to this vision: &ldquo;The moon will blush and the sun be put to shame, when Jehovah of Hosts manifests his reign in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem, and [his] glory in the presence of his elders&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTE5XQ==\">Isaiah 24:23<\/a>; cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODg1NiI6Mn0=\">62:1-2<\/a>). <\/p> ",
