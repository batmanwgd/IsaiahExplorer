The view&mdash;like that of seraphs&mdash;isn&rsquo;t from below but from above (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc3NzMiOjF9LHsiMTg0NDMiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 6:3; 40:22<\/a>). Only those who attain Isaiah&rsquo;s seraph category, therefore, are privy to this vision: &ldquo;The moon will blush and the sun be put to shame, when Jehovah of Hosts manifests his reign in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem, and [his] glory in the presence of his elders&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgxMTkiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 24:23<\/a>; cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg4NTYiOjJ9XQ==\">62:1-2<\/a>).<\/p>",
