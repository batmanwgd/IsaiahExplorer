    "html": "<p>The psalm-like invocation in<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODQ5MSI6M30=\">42:10&ndash;12<\/a> , inviting all and sundry to celebrate Israel&rsquo;s God in song, is followed by discourse by Yahveh (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODQ5NSI6M30=\">vv 14&ndash;16<\/a>), introduced as a warrior god (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDk0XQ==\">v 13<\/a>). After a long period of silence and inactivity, represented vividly in terms of gestation leading to childbirth (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDk1XQ==\">14<\/a>), Yahveh is about to act both in judgment, expressed in the traditional Isaian form of ecological degradation (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDk2XQ==\">15<\/a>), and in salvation, expressed in the equally traditional Isaian motif of &ldquo;blindsight&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDk3XQ==\">v 16<\/a> cf.<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDMwLDE4NTc1XQ==\">40:9; 45:13<\/a>). The final verse deprecating idolatry gives the appearance of having been appended to the saying for the sake of completeness. We may consider the discourse a response to the preceding celebration, while also acknowledging the links of the passage as a whole with the one preceding (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODQ4MiI6OX0=\">42:1&ndash;9<\/a>). The links are abundantly in evidence: the glory and praise of Yahveh (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDg5LDE4NDkxXQ==\">42:8, 10<\/a>), the motif of blindness and darkness (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDg4LDE4NDk3XQ==\">7, 16<\/a>), the islands and coastlands (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDg1LDE4NDkxLDE4NDkzXQ==\">4, 10, 12<\/a>), the abjuration of idols (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDg5LDE4NDk4XQ==\">8, 17<\/a>), and especially the &ldquo;new events&rdquo; (<em>\u1e25\u0103d\u0101&scaron;&ocirc;t<\/em><a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDkwXQ==\">9<\/a>), which call for a new song (<em>&scaron;&icirc;r \u1e25\u0101d\u0101&scaron;<\/em><a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDkxXQ==\">10<\/a>). We are therefore not obliged to choose between linking<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODQ5MSI6M30=\">10&ndash;12<\/a> with<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODQ5NCI6NX0=\">13&ndash;17<\/a> or<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODQ4MiI6OX0=\">1&ndash;9<\/a> (pace Prinsloo 1997; and others).<\/p><p>The invitation to celebrate Yahveh in song is one of several passages in<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODQyMiI6MzMzfQ==\">chs. 40&ndash;55<\/a> (with<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NTU3LDE4NjUwLDE4NzI1XQ==\">44:23; 49:13; 54:1<\/a>) that are modeled on the liturgical hymns of praise. It is addressed to the ocean, coastlands, and islands&mdash;that is, the west&mdash;and the territory of the Kedarite Arabs across the Jordan&mdash;that is, the east&mdash;a perspective that, incidentally, is conformable more to a Judean than a Babylonian location. The song to be sung is qualitatively new, in keeping with the prospect of the new situation held out time and again in<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isa 40&ndash;48<\/a> .<\/p><p>Some of the associations can be garnered from hymns containing the same injunction (<a class=\"ref\">Pss 33; 96; 98; 149<\/a>): the response of the sea and the wilderness, the glory of God, and the proclamation of Yahveh&rsquo;s kingship following victory over chaos and disorder.<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODQ5MSI6M30=\">Isaiah 42:10&ndash;12<\/a> is not an eschatological psalm (pace Westermann 1969, 102), and it is not a psalm composed for a ritual in which Yahveh was ritually enthroned, for which the evidence is lacking (pace Mowinckel 1931, 96). It is a literary composition that uses material from psalms extolling Yahveh as king and creator. We may compare<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODExMCI6M30=\">Isa 24:14&ndash;16a<\/a> :<\/p><blockquote><p>They lift up their voices,<\/p><p>singing joyfully of Yahveh&rsquo;s majesty;<\/p><p>they exult more loudly than the sea!<\/p><p>Therefore give glory to Yahveh in the east,<\/p><p>in the western isles to Yahveh&rsquo;s name,<\/p><p>Yahveh, Israel&rsquo;s God!<\/p><p>From the ends of the earth we hear the refrain,<\/p><p>&ldquo;Glory to the Conquering One!&rdquo;<\/p><\/blockquote><p>The hymnic associations carry over into the following passage, recalling acclamations of Yahveh as warrior god, going forth from Seir-Edom (<a class=\"ref\">Deut 33:2; Judg 5:4<\/a>) or Sinai (<a class=\"ref\">Deut 33:2; Ps 68:9, 18<\/a>) or Paran (<a class=\"ref\">Deut 33:2<\/a>), his appearance surrounded by cosmic reverberations and natural upheavals (<a class=\"ref\">Exod 15:8, 12; Judg 5:4&ndash;5; Ps 18:7&ndash;15; 68:8&ndash;10<\/a>).<\/p><p>The catastrophic effects of this violent intervention in nature&mdash;mountains, hills, rivers, and lakes&mdash;is reminiscent of the anti-Babylonian poem in<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzkwOCI6MjJ9\">ch. 13<\/a> (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODQ5MCI6NX0=\">vv 9&ndash;13<\/a>) and points to the same historical referent. The period of silence and inactivity (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDk1XQ==\">14a<\/a>), of the hiding of God&rsquo;s face, corresponds to the epoch of the Babylonian conquest. The silence of God, of which we hear frequent complaints in the hymns (e.g.<a class=\"ref\">Ps 89:47[46]<\/a>), was the time of Israel&rsquo;s abandonment by God, the end of which is now proclaimed (cf.<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzMxXQ==\">54:7<\/a> , where the duration of the silence and abandonment is estimated more optimistically as &ldquo;a brief moment,&rdquo;<em>rega\u02bf q\u0101\u1e6don<\/em>).<\/p><p>To judgment, expressed in terms of ecological degradation (cf. ecological restoration in<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDcwXQ==\">41:18<\/a>), corresponds salvation, expressed in the familiar Isaian metaphor of restored sight (cf.<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc3NzkiOjJ9LFsxNzgzMSwxODQ4OF0seyIxODQ5OSI6M30sWzE4NTE0LDE4ODExXV0=\">6:9&ndash;10; 9:1; 42:7, 18&ndash;20; 43:8; 59:10<\/a>). The figure of guiding the blind, dispelling the darkness that surrounds them, and removing obstacles from their path, is a return to the theme at the beginning of the section (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODQyNCI6Mn0=\">40:3&ndash;4<\/a>). It would be natural to refer this figurative language to an anticipated return from the diaspora, which according to Ibn Ezra some were suggesting in his day. But the reference may also be taken in a less metaphorical sense and, as such, would later be understood of a literal disability, to be removed in the end time (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MzI2XQ==\">35:5<\/a> cf.<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MjEyXQ==\">29:18<\/a>).<\/p><p>Blenkinsopp, J.
