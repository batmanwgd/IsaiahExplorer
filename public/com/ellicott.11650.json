Of these, some (Cheyne), struck by the apparent abruptness, assume it to be misplaced. There seems no adequate reason for adopting either hypothesis. The words are spoken to Israel, contemplated as in its ideal, as were the others to the actual Israel. It remains true, as ever, that that ideal is fulfilled only in the Servant.<\/p>\n <p>That I may plant.\u2014Noteworthy as the first intimation of the new heaven and the new earth, implying a restitution of all things, of which we find the expression in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4OTE1XQ==\">Isaiah 65:17<\/a>; <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4OTQ1XQ==\">Isaiah 66:22<\/a>.<\/p>",
