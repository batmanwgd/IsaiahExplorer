    "html": " <p>Jehovah offers the covenant blessings of food and drink, physical and spiritual, to both the poor&mdash;&ldquo;you who have no money&rdquo;&mdash;and the rich, who &ldquo;spend money on what is not bread.&rdquo; The words &ldquo;attention,&rdquo; &ldquo;hear well,&rdquo; &ldquo;give ear,&rdquo; and &ldquo;pay heed&rdquo; imply that Jehovah&rsquo;s people need waking up from their covenantal non-compliance to again observing the covenant&rsquo;s terms (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NjY3XQ==\">Isaiah 50:4<\/a>). Except for their keeping Jehovah&rsquo;s law and word, his covenant blessings are free&mdash;&ldquo;at no cost.&rdquo; As now is the &ldquo;favorable time&rdquo; and &ldquo;day of salvation&rdquo; in which Jehovah restores his people (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODY0NSI6Nn0=\">Isaiah 49:8-13<\/a>), they have but two choices. <\/p> <p>Chapter 55 forms an integral part of Part VI of Isaiah&rsquo;s Seven-Part Structure (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODc0MiI6ODF9\">Isaiah 28-31; 55-59<\/a>), which juxtaposes a Covenant of Life&mdash;&ldquo;that your souls may live&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzQ0XQ==\">v 3<\/a>)&mdash;modeled on the Davidic Covenant with a &ldquo;Covenant with Death&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTgwLDE4MTgzXQ==\">Isaiah 28:15, 18<\/a>) that is grounded in human counsels and schemes. Unlike the Sinai Covenant, Jehovah&rsquo;s &ldquo;everlasting covenant&rdquo; is unconditional to individuals who prove loyal to Jehovah under all conditions. His servant&mdash;the &ldquo;David&rdquo; of Hebrew prophecy (<a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 33:15-16; Ezekiel 34:23-25; Hosea 3:5<\/a>)&mdash;personifies and mediates it (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDg3LDE4NjQ1XQ==\">Isaiah 42:6; 49:8<\/a>). <\/p> ",
