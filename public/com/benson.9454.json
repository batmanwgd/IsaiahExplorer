And by the law of nations, being taken in war, they were justly detained in captivity till they should be ransomed or exchanged. So here was a double, or rather, treble impediment to their deliverance; the great power of the enemy, which kept them in bondage, and the justice of God, and the usage of nations, which pleaded against them. And yet their deliverance, however improbable, was effected by the mercy and power of God. But this passage, as appears from the context, has a further reference: it respects the deliverance of God\u2019s church and people from their spiritual as well as temporal enemies. \u201cGod had promised very great and excellent things to his church; but to a person seriously considering the state thereof, and comparing it with the power of his enemies, and particularly its chief enemy, Satan, who held the nations in the darkness of ignorance and superstition, a doubt would naturally arise, whether it could possibly be that this prey, so long possessed by Satan, could be rescued from him, so that he might be driven from his strong fort, and the rulers of the world, held in subjection by him, might be delivered from their servitude. Isaiah resolves this doubt of the church, and teaches that it should certainly come to pass that Satan, this mighty one, should be driven from his fort, his captives delivered, (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NjYyXQ==\">Isaiah 49:25<\/a>,) and the adversaries of the church perish by their mutual slaughter of each other.\u201d Thus Vitringa, who observes that <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NjYzXQ==\">Isaiah 49:26<\/a>, <i>I will feed them that oppress thee with their own flesh, <\/i>&c., is to be \u201cunderstood metaphorically, and refers to the intestine wars, by which princes and people, armed to their mutual destruction, plunge their destroying swords in each other\u2019s bowels, and, as it were, feed upon each other\u2019s flesh and blood.\u201d See <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODUwXQ==\">Isaiah 9:20<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\">Zechariah 11:9; Revelation 16:6<\/a>. <i>They shall be drunken with their own blood as with new wine <\/i>\u2014 I will make thine enemies destroy one another, and that greedily, and with delight. This prophecy was remarkably fulfilled in the time of the Roman emperor, Dioclesian, to which it is thought by some particularly to refer. <\/p>",
