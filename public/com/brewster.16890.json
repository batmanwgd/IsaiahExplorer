This is a powerful image, but there is a mean-ing to this verse that is even more significant. The Book of Mormon prophet-king Benjamin provided the following description: \"Therefore if that man repenteth not, and remaineth and dieth an enemy to God, the demands of divine justice do awaken his immortal soul to a lively sense of his own guilt, which doth cause him to shrink from the presence of the Lord, and doth fill his breast with guilt, and pain, and anguish, <i>which is like an unquenchable fire, whose flame ascendeth up forever and ever.<\/i>\" (<a class=\"ref\">Mosiah 2:38<\/a>; italics added.)<\/p>     <p>There will also be a literal burning of the wicked at the Second Coming: \"For, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble.\" (<a class=\"ref\">Malachi 4:1<\/a>; see also BICQ, 194-96.)<\/p>",
