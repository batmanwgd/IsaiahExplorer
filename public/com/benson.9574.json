Or rather, <i>sought to, <\/i> or <i>sought for, <\/i> that is, one in great esteem and request; one that the Gentiles shall seek to join themselves to, so as to be one church with thee. Or, <i>one cared for, <\/i> namely, by God, whom he hath, out of infinite love, gathered to himself. <i>A city not forsaken <\/i>\u2014The meaning is, that they should thus esteem the gospel church, that she should be accosted with such salutations as these are, <i>the holy people, the redeemed of the Lord, <\/i> &c. Vitringa thinks that the first completion of this prophecy is to be sought for in the times of the Emperor Constantine; but it is probable that it has a further reference to some great and future reformation and restoration of the church. <\/p> ",
