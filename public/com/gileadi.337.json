    "html": "<p>Jehovah pronounces a curse on those who live a double standard. His people&rsquo;s &ldquo;schemes&rdquo; or &ldquo;plans&rdquo; (<em>&lsquo;esa<\/em>), concocted in private, put them at odds with Jehovah and cause spiritual blindness. Instead of aligning their actions with his desire for his people (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDM0LDE4NTk4XQ==\">Isaiah 40:13; 46:11<\/a>), they attempt to make Jehovah follow theirs: &ldquo;Woe to those in conflict with their Maker, mere shards of earthenware pottery! As though the clay were to say to him who molds it, &lsquo;What are you doing? Your hands have no skill for the work!&rsquo;&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTg1NzE=\">Isaiah 45:9<\/a>). By pursuing their own agenda, they are their own gods (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODQ3MyI6NH0=\">Isaiah 41:21-24<\/a>).<\/p>",
