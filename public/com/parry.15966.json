    "html": " <i>unclean thing\/righteousnesses are as filthy rags.<\/i> Under the Mosaic law the term <i>unclean<\/i> often applied to those with a bodily discharge (whether male or female) or with leprosy. Commanded to live outside the bounds of normal society, such people symbolized those whose sins made them spiritually unclean and unfit to live with God and his holy ones. Filthy rags were those stained with menstrual blood, a reminder of our mortal, fallen state. The implication here is that even though we perform righteous acts, we are still fallen, imperfect, and unclean before the Lord. Because of our fallen nature, our righteousness is insufficient to save us. Only when our righteousness is combined with the righteousness of Christ can we receive exaltation (<a class=\"ref\">2 Ne. 15:23<\/a>). <\/p> <p> <i>fade as a leaf, iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.<\/i> Sin saps our moral strength and leads us to spiritual death (see <a class=\"ref\">Ezek. 18:24; 33:12<\/a>). Our desire for righteousness fades, and we are swept away as the wind blows the dried autumn leaves (17:13; 29:5; <a class=\"ref\">Ps. 1:4<\/a>). <\/p> ",
