<p>\u2003on a fertile hillside.<\/p>         <p> He dug it up and cleared it of stones<\/p>         <p>\u2003and planted it with the choicest vines.<\/p>         <p>He built a watchtower in it<\/p>         <p>\u2003and cut out a winepress as well.<\/p>         <p>Then he looked for a crop of good grapes,<\/p>         <p>\u2003but it yielded only bad fruit.<\/p>         <p> \u201cNow you dwellers in Jerusalem and men of Judah,<\/p>         <p>\u2003judge between me and my vineyard.<\/p>         <p> What more could have been done for my vineyard<\/p>         <p>\u2003than I have done for it?<\/p>         <p>When I looked for good grapes,<\/p>         <p>\u2003why did it yield only bad?<\/p>         <p> Now I will tell you<\/p>         <p>\u2003what I am going to do to my vineyard:<\/p>         <p>I will take away its hedge,<\/p>         <p>\u2003and it will be destroyed;<\/p>         <p>I will break down its wall,<\/p>         <p>\u2003and it will be trampled.<\/p>         <p>I will make it a wasteland,<\/p>         <p>\u2003neither pruned nor cultivated,<\/p>         <p>\u2003and briers and thorns will grow there.<\/p>         <p>I will command the clouds<\/p>         <p>\u2003not to rain on it.\u201d<\/p>         <p>The vineyard of the L<small>ORD<\/small> Almighty<\/p>         <p>\u2003is the house of Israel,<\/p>         <p>and the men of Judah<\/p>         <p>\u2003are the garden of his delight.<\/p>         <p>And he looked for justice, but saw bloodshed;<\/p>         <p>\u2003for righteousness, but heard cries of distress.<\/p>         <p> Woe to you who add house to house<\/p>         <p>\u2003and join field to field<\/p>         <p>\u2003till no space is left<\/p>         <p>\u2003and you live alone in the land.<\/p>         <p>The L<small>ORD<\/small> Almighty has declared in my hearing:<\/p>         <p>\u201cSurely the great houses will become desolate,<\/p>         <p>\u2003the fine mansions left without occupants.<\/p>         <p> A ten-acre vineyard will produce only a bath of wine,<\/p>         <p>\u2003a homer of seed only an ephah of grain.\u201d<\/p>         <p> Woe to those who rise early in the morning<\/p>         <p>\u2003to run after their drinks,<\/p>         <p>who stay up late at night<\/p>         <p>\u2003till they are inflamed with wine.<\/p>         <p> They have harps and lyres at their banquets,<\/p>         <p>\u2003tambourines and flutes and wine,<\/p>         <p>but they have no regard for the deeds of the L<small>ORD<\/small>,<\/p>         <p>\u2003no respect for the work of his hands.<\/p>         <p> Therefore my people will go into exile<\/p>         <p>\u2003for lack of understanding;<\/p>         <p>their men of rank will die of hunger<\/p>         <p>\u2003and their masses will be parched with thirst.<\/p>         <p> Therefore the grave enlarges its appetite<\/p>         <p>\u2003and opens its mouth without limit;<\/p>         <p>into it will descend their nobles and masses<\/p>         <p>\u2003with all their brawlers and revelers.<\/p>         <p> So man will be brought low<\/p>         <p>\u2003and mankind humbled,<\/p>         <p>\u2003the eyes of the arrogant humbled.<\/p>         <p> But the L<small>ORD<\/small> Almighty will be exalted by his justice,<\/p>         <p>\u2003and the holy God will show himself holy by his<\/p>         <p>\u2003righteousness.<\/p>         <p> Then sheep will graze as in their own pasture;<\/p>         <p>\u2003lambs will feed among the ruins of the rich.<\/p>         <p> Woe to those who draw sin along with cords of deceit,<\/p>         <p>\u2003and wickedness as with cart ropes,<\/p>         <p> to those who say, \u201cLet God hurry,<\/p>         <p>\u2003let him hasten his work<\/p>         <p>\u2003so we may see it.<\/p>         <p>Let it approach,<\/p>         <p>\u2003let the plan of the Holy One of Israel come,<\/p>         <p>\u2003so we may know it.\u201d<\/p>         <p> Woe to those who call evil good<\/p>         <p>\u2003and good evil,<\/p>         <p>who put darkness for light<\/p>         <p>\u2003and light for darkness,<\/p>         <p>who put bitter for sweet<\/p>         <p>\u2003and sweet for bitter.<\/p>         <p> Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes<\/p>         <p>\u2003and clever in their own sight.<\/p>         <p> Woe to those who are heroes at drinking wine<\/p>         <p>\u2003and champions at mixing drinks,<\/p>         <p> who acquit the guilty for a bribe,<\/p>         <p>\u2003but deny justice to the innocent.<\/p>         <p> Therefore, as tongues of fire lick up straw<\/p>         <p>\u2003and as dry grass sinks down in the flames,<\/p>         <p>so their roots will decay<\/p>         <p>\u2003and their flowers blow away like dust;<\/p>         <p>for they have rejected the law of the L<small>ORD<\/small> Almighty<\/p>         <p>\u2003and spurned the word of the Holy One of Israel.<\/p>         <p> Therefore the L<small>ORD<\/small>\u2019s anger burns against his people;<\/p>         <p>\u2003his hand is raised and he strikes them down.<\/p>         <p>The mountains shake,<\/p>         <p>\u2003and the dead bodies are like refuse in the streets.<\/p>         <p>Yet for all this, his anger is not turned away,<\/p>         <p>\u2003his hand is still upraised.<\/p>         <p> He lifts up a banner for the distant nations,<\/p>         <p>\u2003he whistles for those at the ends of the earth.<\/p>         <p>Here they come,<\/p>         <p>\u2003swiftly and speedily!<\/p>         <p> Not one of them grows tired or stumbles,<\/p>         <p>\u2003not one slumbers or sleeps;<\/p>         <p>not a belt is loosened at the waist,<\/p>         <p>\u2003not a sandal thong is broken.<\/p>         <p> Their arrows are sharp,<\/p>         <p>\u2003all their bows are strung;<\/p>         <p>their horses\u2019 hoofs seem like flint,<\/p>         <p>\u2003their chariot wheels like a whirlwind.<\/p>         <p> Their roar is like that of the lion,<\/p>         <p>\u2003they roar like young lions;<\/p>         <p>they growl as they seize their prey<\/p>         <p>\u2003and carry it off with no one to rescue.<\/p>         <p> In that day they will roar over it<\/p>         <p>\u2003like the roaring of the sea.<\/p>         <p>And if one looks at the land,<\/p>         <p>\u2003he will see darkness and distress;<\/p>         <p>\u2003even the light will be darkened by the clouds.<\/p>     <\/blockquote>     <h4>Original Meaning<\/h4>     <p>I<small>N CHAPTER<\/small> 5 Isaiah brings his introduction to a close. Once again, without transition, the tone shifts from hope to judgment. Once again, as real as the future hope may be, the prophet wants his readers to know that apart from a radical change of behavior, the only way for that hope to be realized is through the fire. The chapter divides fairly clearly into three sections. (1) The first is another graphic illustration, that of a vineyard that despite the farmer\u2019s careful work produces only bitter grapes (5:1\u20136). (2) Next is the explanation of the illustration, in which the prophet declares that Israel is the vineyard, God the farmer, and the bitter grapes Israel\u2019s sinful behavior (5:7\u201324). (3) The conclusion (5:25\u201330) states that the enemy nations are being called in to destroy Israel, just as the wild animals were called in to destroy the useless vineyard.<\/p>     ",
