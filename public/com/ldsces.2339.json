    "html": "<p>Though he spoke of great destruction and judgments, Isaiah was filled not with despair but with joy. Here he burst into a hymn of exultation because the Lord would finally come and reign in Zion and Jerusalem (see<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTE5XQ==\">Isaiah 24:23<\/a>).<\/p><p>The Second Coming will be a time of great rejoicing that follows &ldquo;much tribulation&rdquo; (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 58:3&ndash;4<\/a>). A great &ldquo;feast of fat things&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTI1XQ==\">Isaiah 25:6<\/a>) will also attend the Lord&rsquo;s return, meaning that men will feast upon the fruits of the gospel until they are full (compare<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 58:8<\/a>). The Lord&rsquo;s coming will help to dispel &ldquo;the vail that is spread over all nations&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTI2XQ==\">Isaiah 25:7<\/a>). This veil may be the &ldquo;dark veil of unbelief&rdquo; (<a class=\"ref\">Alma 19:6<\/a> ; see also<a class=\"ref\">Ether 4:15<\/a>) which characterizes those of the latter days who reject the gospel. Or, it could be a more literal &ldquo;veil of darkness,&rdquo; such as that described in<a class=\"ref\">Moses 7:61<\/a> when the heavens shall be darkened and &ldquo;shall shake, and also the earth.&rdquo; But great joy will also follow, for the time will come when &ldquo;the Lord God will wipe away tears from off all faces&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTI3XQ==\">Isaiah 25:8<\/a>). This figure is used twice in the book of Revelation (<a class=\"ref\">Revelation 7:17; 21:4<\/a>) and obviously represents a millennial condition.<\/p><p class=\"cite\"> LDS Church Educational System Old Testament Student Manual, 1 Kings&ndash;Malachi, Religion 302, Chapter 15, Item 7<\/p> ",
