While man&rsquo;s thoughts and ways are marred by temptations and transgressions, Jehovah&rsquo;s ways are at all times pure and holy. And while man&rsquo;s perspective is limited mostly to his experience with earthly matters, Jehovah&rsquo;s perspective transcends man&rsquo;s by encompassing the heavenly and the earthly. But those differences aren&rsquo;t enough simply to contemplate. The challenge of Jehovah&rsquo;s people is to learn Jehovah&rsquo;s thoughts and ways and make them their own.<\/p><p>Jehovah&rsquo;s servant, who exemplifies <em>righteousness<\/em> (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc4ODkiOjJ9LFsxODQ1NF0seyIxODU5OCI6M31d\">Isaiah 11:4-5; 41:2; 46:11-13<\/a>), succeeds in this.
