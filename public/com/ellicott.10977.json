    "html": "<p>             (8) Yea, the fir trees rejoice at thee.\u2014The tree has been identified (Carruthers, in Bible Educator, 4, 359) with the Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis), which grows abundantly on the Lebanon range above the zone of the evergreen oaks. The LXX. often translates it by \u201ccypress,\u201d the Vulgate and Authorised version commonly by \u201cfir tree.\u201d Its wood was largely used in house and ship-building, but was less precious than the cedar (<a class=\"ref\">1 Kings 5:10; 1 Kings 6:15; 1 Kings 6:34<\/a>; <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzIxMTI3XQ==\">Isaiah 41:19; Ezekiel 27:5<\/a>).<\/p>\n <p>No feller is come up against us\u2014The literal and figurative senses melt into each other, the former perhaps being the more prominent. It was the boast of Assurbanipal and other Assyrian kings that wherever they conquered they cut down forests and left the land bare. (Comp. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 37:24<\/a> : Records of the Past, i. 86.) As the fir tree, the cedar, and the oak were the natural symbols of kingly rule (<a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 22:7; Ezekiel 17:3; Ezekiel 31:3<\/a>), this devastation represented the triumph of the Chald\u00e6an king over other princes. On his downfall, the trees on the mountain, the kings and chieftains in their palaces, would alike rejoice.<\/p>",
