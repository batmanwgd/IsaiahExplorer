Note the active role played by God, who will <i>bring upon [King Ahaz and his kingdom] the king of Assyria.<\/i> In 10:5- 26, God says he will use the Assyrians as his staff to beat the people.<\/p> <p><i>days that have not come, from the day that Ephraim departed from Judah.<\/i> The disaster that came on the kingdom of Judah is compared to the rebellion of the ten tribes under Jeroboam's leadership (<a class=\"ref\">1 Kgs. 12<\/a>). Israel had not had days so severe since that rebellion.<\/p> ",
