As Jehovah&rsquo;s people in the past were ignominiously driven from their lands because of transgression, so their righteous descendants return in a glorious exodus from among the nations (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3OTAxXQ==\">Isaiah 11:16 <\/a>). Those &ldquo;who have been in anguish for her&rdquo;&mdash;for the Woman Zion, Jehovah&rsquo;s elect&mdash;are those who &ldquo;mourn in Zion&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODQ3XQ==\">Isaiah 61:3 <\/a>), who &ldquo;call upon Jehovah&rdquo; day and night for his people&rsquo;s restoration (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODg2MSI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 62:6-7 <\/a>). <\/p> ",
