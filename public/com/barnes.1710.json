    "html": "<p><em>For they call themselves of the holy city<\/em>&mdash;Of Jerusalem (see <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTg2OTg=\">Isaiah 52:1<\/a> ; <a class=\"ref\">Nehemiah 11:1; Matthew 4:5; Matthew 27:53; Revelation 21:2-27<\/a> ). The word rendered &lsquo;for&rsquo; here, (\u05db\u05d9 k\u0131\u0302y) means, as it often does, &ldquo;although&rdquo;; and the sense is, although they call themselves of the holy city, they do not worship God in sincerity and truth. Jerusalem was called &lsquo;the holy city,&rsquo; because the temple, the ark, and the symbol of the divine presence were there, and it was the place where God was worshipped. It was deemed sacred by the Jews, and they regarded it as sufficient proof of goodness, it would seem, that they had dwelt there. Even in Babylon they would pride themselves on this, and suppose, perhaps, that it entitled them to divine protection and favor.<\/p><p><em>And stay themselves upon the God of Israel<\/em>&mdash;In time of danger and trial they profess to seek him, and to commit their cause to him.<\/p><p><em>The Lord of hosts is his name<\/em>&mdash;(See the notes at <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTc2NjQ=\">Isaiah 1:9<\/a>). The object of the prophet in here mentioning his holy name is, probably, to show them the guilt of their conduct. He was Yahweh, the source of all existence. He was the God of all the hosts of heaven, and all the armies on earth. How wicked, therefore, it was to come before him in a false and hypocritical manner, and while they were professedly worshipping him, to be really offering their hearts to idols, and to be characteristically inclined to relapse into idolatry!<\/p>",
