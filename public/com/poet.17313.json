In that day the Lord will conquer Satan (v. 1)<\/p> <p>B. The house of Israel (vineyard) is sung about (2)<\/p> <p>C. The Lord watches over the people (3)<\/p> <p>D. The Lord consumes his enemies with fire (4)<\/p> <p>E. The strength and friendship of the Lord for his followers (5)<\/p> <p>F. Jacob will grow and prosper (6)<\/p> <p>G. Israel has not suffered as much as her oppressor (7-8)<\/p> <p>F'. Jacob will be purged (9)<\/p> <p>E'. The strength and power of the Lord against his enemies (9)<\/p> <p>D'. Animals consume the branches and women make fires with them (10-11)<\/p> <\/blockquote><p>C'. The Lord knows the people lack understanding (or obedience; see <a class=\"ref\">Job 28:28<\/a>) (11)<\/p> <p>B'. The house of Israel gathered one by one (12)<\/p> <p>A'. In that day the righteous will worship the Lord together (13)<\/p>",
