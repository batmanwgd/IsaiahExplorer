    "html": "<p><em>The way of the just is uprightness<\/em>&mdash;The Hebrew is literally, &lsquo;The way to the just is uprightness;&rsquo; the word &lsquo;way&rsquo; probably refers to God&rsquo;s way, or his dealings with the righteous. The sentiment is, that his dealings with them are just; that though they are afflicted and oppressed, yet that his ways are right, and they will yet perceive it. This is language supposed to be used by the captive Jews after they had seen the proud city of Babylon taken, and after God had come forth to restore them to their own land. The word &lsquo;uprightness&rsquo; in the original is in the plural number, but is often used in the sense of straightness <a class=\"ref\">Proverbs 23:31<\/a>; Sol 7:10; of sincerity, or uprightness Sol 1:4; or of righteousness as a judge Psa 9:9; <a class=\"ref\">Psalm 58:2; Psalm 99:4<\/a>.<\/p><p><em>Thou most upright<\/em>&mdash;Evidently an address to God, as being most just, and as having now evinced his uprightness in the deliverance of his people. The same epithet is applied to him in <a class=\"ref\">Deuteronomy 32:4; Psalm 25:8; Psalm 92:16<\/a>.<\/p><p><em>Dost weigh the path of the just<\/em>&mdash;The word used here (\u05e4\u05dc\u05e1 pa\u0302lac) may mean to weigh as in a balance <a class=\"ref\">Psalm 58:3<\/a>; but it may also mean, and does usually, to make straight or smooth; to beat a path; to make level <a class=\"ref\">Psalm 78:50; Proverbs 4:26; Proverbs 5:21<\/a>. Here it probably means, that God had made the way smooth, or exactly level. He had removed all obstacles, and had conducted his people in a plain and leveled way (see the notes at <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODQyNCI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 40:3-4<\/a>).<\/p> ",
