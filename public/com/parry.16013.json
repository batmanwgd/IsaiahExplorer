    "html": " <i>bring to the birth&hellip;shut the womb.<\/i> In the natural world, once a woman comes to the point of travail, where labor has begun and the baby is ready to be born, the baby is indeed brought forth. The Lord does not at that point \"shut the womb.\" In the same way, he will not cause Zion to come to the point of giving birth to her children of righteousness and then shut the womb. The birth of the children of Zion is as certain as the birth of any infant.<\/p> <p>There is also another possible way to understand this phrase. Anciently, the birth of infants was not always certain. A woman could come to the point of delivery and yet because of complications (such as the cord being around the baby's neck or the baby being in an unworkable position), she would find her womb, in effect, to be \"shut,\" and both she and the baby could die without delivery. The Lord says, however, that what he brings to delivery will indeed come forth.<\/p> ",
