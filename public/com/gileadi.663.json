    "html": "<p>Individuals who attain higher spiritual categories spontaneously delight in Jehovah: &ldquo;I rejoice exceedingly in Jehovah; my soul delights in my God. For he clothes me in garments of salvation, he arrays me in a robe of righteousness&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTg4NTQ=\">Isaiah 61:10<\/a>). As they become privileged to receive Jehovah&rsquo;s highest covenant blessings, they attain his view of the world and their place in it: &ldquo;Your eyes shall behold the King in his glory and view the expanse of the earth&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTgyOTc=\">Isaiah 33:17<\/a>). Jehovah&rsquo;s servant&mdash;his <em>mouth<\/em>&mdash;expedites their spiritual ascent that ultimately leads to their physical regeneration (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MjkxLDE4NDUyXQ==\">v 11; Isaiah 40:31<\/a>).<\/p>",
