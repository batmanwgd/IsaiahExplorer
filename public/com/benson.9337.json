Bishop Lowth reads: <i>I roared until the morning like the lion; so did he break to pieces all my bones. Like a crane or a swallow, <\/i>&c. \u2014 \u201cMy pains were sometimes so violent that they forced me to cry aloud; at other times my strength was so exhausted that I could only groan inwardly, and bemoan my unhappy condition in sighs.\u201d <i>I did mourn as a dove <\/i>\u2014 Whose mournful tone is observed <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 59:11<\/a>, and elsewhere; <i>mine eyes fail with looking upward <\/i>\u2014 While I lift up my eyes and heart to God for relief in vain; <i>O Lord, I am oppressed <\/i>\u2014 Namely, by my disease, which, like a sergeant, hath seized upon me, and is haling me to the prison of the grave; <i>undertake for me <\/i>\u2014 Stop the execution, and rescue me out of his hands.<\/p>",
