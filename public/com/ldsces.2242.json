    "html": " <p>The Book of Mormon clarifies the meaning of this significant verse (see <a class=\"ref\">2 Nephi 13:9 <\/a>). Individuals radiate the quality of their spirit and attitude. They manifest the real person&mdash;good or evil. Isaiah warned that the disobedient cannot hide the effects of their transgressions from others. President David O. McKay provided the following insights into this principle: <\/p> <p>&ldquo;Every man and every person who lives in this world wields an influence, whether for good or for evil. It is not what he says alone; it is not alone what he does. It is what he is. Every man, every person radiates what he or she really is. &hellip; It is what we are and what we <em>radiate <\/em> that affects the people around us. <\/p> <p>&ldquo;As individuals, we must think nobler thoughts. We must not encourage vile thoughts or low aspirations. We shall radiate them if we do. If we think noble thoughts; if we encourage and cherish noble aspirations, there will be that radiation when we meet people, especially when we associate with them.&rsquo; (<em>Man May Know for Himself, <\/em> p. 108.) <\/p> <p class=\"cite\"> LDS Church Educational System Old Testament Student Manual, 1 Kings&ndash;Malachi, Religion 302, Chapter 13, Item 18 <\/p> ",
