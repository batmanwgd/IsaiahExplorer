(See IPSP, 358-60.) There are differences of opinion among commentaries regarding the identity of this Servant. While there may be dual meaning to these verses, the author believes the song in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 50<\/a> refers primarily to the Messiah. He will be treated despicably, but the power of God will be manifest in Him. Those who oppose Him will be destroyed.<\/p>     <table>         <tbody>             <tr>                 <td>4 The Lord God hath given me the tongue of the learned, that I should know how to speak a word in season <i>to <\/i><u>him that is<\/u> weary<u>:<\/u> he <i>wakeneth<\/i> morning by morning<u>, h<\/u> e <i>wakeneth<\/i> mine ear to hear as the learned.                     <br>                     <br>5 The Lord God hath opened mine ear, and I was not rebellious, neither turned away back.                     <br>                     <br>6 I gave my back to the smiter<u>s<\/u>, and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair<u>:<\/u> I hid not my face from shame and spitting.                     <br>                     <br>7 For the Lord God will help me<u>;<\/u> therefore shall I not be confounded<u>:<\/u> therefore have I set my face like a flint, and I know that I shall not be ashamed.                     <br>                     <br>8 <u>He<\/u> is near <u>that<\/u> justifieth me<u>; w<\/u> ho will contend with me? <u>l<\/u>et us stand together<u>: w<\/u> ho is mine adversary? <u>l<\/u>et him come near <u>to<\/u> me<u>.<\/u>                     <br>                     <br>9 <u>Behold,<\/u> the Lord God will help me<u>;<\/u> who <u>is he that<\/u> shall condemn me<u>? lo,<\/u><i> they all<\/i> shall wax old as a garment<u>;<\/u> the moth shall eat them up.                     <br>                 <\/td>                 <td>4 The Lord God hath given me the tongue of the learned, that I should know how to speak a word in season <i>unto <\/i><u>thee, O house of Israel.
