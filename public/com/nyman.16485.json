The Anchor Bible translates this line \"that her sentence is served, her penalty is paid.\" Judah was to be sent through the \"furnace of affliction\" (see 48:10), so the message given here is to be fulfilled after she has been through that furnace. A look at history and at present-day circumstances shows her still to be going through that furnace. The rest of the chapter also supports a Second Coming time period.<\/p>     ",
