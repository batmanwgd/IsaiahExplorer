The king boasts of his accomplishments in verses 13\u201314.  <\/p>  <p>  <b>2 Nephi 20:15. The ax gets the ax <\/b>Which is greater, the tool or the carpenter? The Lord illustrates that although the Assyrian king believes he did all these things on his own, he was only a tool in the carpenter's hand.  <\/p>  <p>  <b>2 Nephi 20:16. \"His fat ones\"<\/b> Fat is a symbol of prosperity, and the prosperous king of Assyria will soon experience \"leanness.\"  <\/p>  <p>  <b>2 Nephi 20:17. Round Up the briers and thorns<\/b> These weeds are referred to elsewhere as symbols for the wicked or worldly influences. (See comments on 2 Nephi 15:5\u20136).  <\/p>  <p>  <b>2 Nephi 20:17. \"In one day\"<\/b> This phrase can mean in a short time, or it can also mean, literally, in one day (as we will discover later in this chapter).  <\/p>  <p>  <b>2 Nephi 20:18\u201319. \"His forest\"<\/b> Again, trees often symbolize people in Isaiah, and here the king of Assyria's forests, or armies, will be hewn down, until there are so few left that a child may \"write\" or \"count\" them (notice footnote 19<i>a<\/i>).  <\/p>  ",
