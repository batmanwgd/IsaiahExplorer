    "html": "<p><em>Instead of sweet smell \"perfume\"\u2014<\/em> A principal part of the delicacy of the Asiatic ladies consists in the use of baths, and of the richest oils and perfumes; an attention to which is in some degree necessary in those hot countries. Frequent mention is made of the rich ointments of the spouse in the Song of Solomon,<a class=\"ref\">Song of Solomon 4:10, Song of Solomon 4:11<\/a> ; : -<\/p> \n\n<p>\"How beautiful are thy breasts, my sister, my spouse!<\/p> \n\n<p>How much more excellent than wine;<\/p> \n\n<p>And the odour of thine ointments than all perfumes!<\/p> \n\n<p>Thy lips drop as the honey-comb, my spouse!<\/p> \n\n<p>Honey and milk are under thy tongue:<\/p> \n\n<p>And the odor of thy garments is as the odour of Lebanon.\"<\/p> \n\n<p>The preparation for Esther's being introduced to King Ahasuerus was a course of bathing and perfuming for a whole year; \"six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with sweet odours;\"<a class=\"ref\">Esther 2:12<\/a> ; (note). A diseased and loathsome habit of body, instead of a beautiful skin, softened and made agreeable with all that art could devise, and all that nature, so prodigal in those countries of the richest perfumes, could supply, must have been a punishment the most severe and the most mortifying to the delicacy of these haughty daughters of Sion.<\/p> \n\n<p><em>Burning instead of beauty \"A sunburnt skin\"\u2014<\/em> Gaspar Sanctius thinks the words<span class=\"greek-hebrew\"> \u05ea\u05d7\u05ea \u05db\u05d9<\/span><span class=\"translit\"> ki thachath<\/span> an interpolation, because the Vulgate has omitted them. The clause<span class=\"greek-hebrew\"> \u05d9\u05e4\u05d9 \u05ea\u05d7\u05ea \u05db\u05d9<\/span><span class=\"translit\"> ki thachath yophi<\/span> seems to me rather to be imperfect at the end. Not to mention that<span class=\"greek-hebrew\"> \u05db\u05d9<\/span><span class=\"translit\"> ki<\/span> , taken as a noun for<span class=\"translit\"> adustio<\/span> , burning, is without example, and very improbable. The passage ends abruptly, and seems to want a fuller conclusion.<\/p> \n\n<p>In agreement with which opinion, of the defect of the Hebrew text in this place, the Septuagint, according to MSS. Pachom. and 1 D. ii., and Marchal., which are of the best authority, express it with the same evident marks of imperfection at the end of the sentence; thus:<span class=\"greek-hebrew\"> \u03c4\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03b1 \u03c3\u03bf\u03b9 \u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9 \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03c9\u03c0\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5<\/span> The two latter add<span class=\"greek-hebrew\"> \u03b4\u03bf\u03c5<\/span> .
