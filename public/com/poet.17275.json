From verses 21-24, it is obvious that the people of Jerusalem do not heed Isaiah's admonition to repent. Consequently, they find themselves out of favor with God and subject to his wrath. Their sins include adultery, murder, graft (adulterating the silver with alloys), deception (watering the wine),  rebellion, thievery, corruption (accepting bribes), and injustice (oppressing the needy). Small wonder, then, that they should be counted as the Lord's enemies and worthy of his vengeance (v. 24).<\/p> <p>One immediate fulfillment of this prophecy upon Israel was the invasion by Assyria and the forced resettlement of many Israelites in the far reaches of the Assyrian Empire. Also, according to Oliver Cowdery, the angel Moroni quoted these verses to Joseph Smith and told him that they referred to the Ten Tribes, who were scattered because of their apostasy. Moroni indicated that the next verses predict a future restoration of Israel. (<i>Messenger and Advocate,<\/i> Apr. 1835, p. 110.)<\/p>",
