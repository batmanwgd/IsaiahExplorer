    "html": "<p><em> \u201cFor as the new heaven and the new earth, which I am about to make, continue before me, saith Jehovah, so will your family and your name continue.\u201d<\/em> The great mass of the world of nations and of Israel also perish; but the seed and name of Israel, i.e., Israel as a people with the same ancestors and an independent name, continues for ever, like the new heaven and the new earth; and because the calling of Israel towards the world of nations is now fulfilled and everything has become new, the former fencing off of Israel from other nations comes to an end, and the qualification for priesthood and Levitical office in the temple of God is no longer merely natural descent, but inward nobility. The new heaven and the new earth, God's approaching creation (<em> quae facturus sum <\/em> ), continue eternally before Him (<em> l e pha\u0302nai <\/em> as in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NjUzXQ==\">Isaiah 49:16<\/a>), for the old ones pass away because they do not please God; but these are pleasing to Him, and are eternally like His love, whose work and image they are. The prophet here thinks of the church of the future as being upon a new earth and under a new heaven. But he cannot conceive of the eternal in the form of eternity; all that he can do is to conceive of it as the endless continuance of the history of time.<\/p>",
