That he will have influence there is shown by the Prophet Joseph Smith's statement that \"when we have power to put all enemies under our feet in this world, and a knowledge to <i>triumph over all evil spirits in the world to come,<\/i> then we are saved\" (TPJS, p. 297). <a class=\"ref\">Alma 34:34-35<\/a> also shows that the spirit of the devil will have power to possess the unrepentant in the spirit world. When he is bound in the spirit world, \"the chief ones of the earth\"-those leaders who were influential in the devil's kingdom while they lived upon the earth-will assemble to greet him. When they see him, they will be amazed at his having lost his power.<\/p>     ",
