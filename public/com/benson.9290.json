Bishop Lowth, on the authority of two MSS, (one of them ancient,) reads <span class=\"hebrew_text\">,\u05de\u05e9\u05c2\u05d4 \u05de\u05d5\u05e4\u05e8\u05d4<\/span>, <i>the staff of correction,<\/i>, which Le Clerc also supposes to be the true reading. The bishop, therefore, translates the clause thus: <i>And it shall be, that wherever shall pass the rod of correction, which Jehovah shall lay heavily upon him, it shall be accompanied with tabrets and harps;<\/i>, that is, as the bishop explains it, \u201cwith every demonstration of joy and thanksgiving for the destruction of the enemy in so wonderful a manner: with hymns of praise, accompanied with musical instruments.\u201d <i>And in battles of shaking,<\/i>,&c.\u2014Or, as it may be better rendered, in fierce or tremendous battles <i>shall he,<\/i>, namely, the Lord, <i>fight against them,<\/i>, that is, against the Assyrians. <\/p>",
