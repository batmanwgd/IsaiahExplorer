Although former harvests were plentiful, the earth&rsquo;s &ldquo;harvest&rdquo; of Jehovah&rsquo;s Day of Judgment sees the few elect who remain gathered out like mere &ldquo;gleanings&rdquo; from such an abundance before covenant curses become irrevocable ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODEwOV0seyIxODE2NCI6Mn1d\">Isaiah 24:13; 27:12-13<\/a>). The rest of Jehovah&rsquo;s people&mdash;those of Jacob\/Israel who don&rsquo;t repent and return&mdash;seek to survive in what literally becomes a valley of &ldquo;<em>rephaim<\/em> &rdquo; or &ldquo;ghosts.&rdquo;<\/p> ",
