    "html": " <p> <em>In that day\u2014 <\/em>,Thus far the prophecy relates to the Israelites, and manifestly denounces their approaching destruction by Shalmaneser. Here it turns to the two tribes of Judah and Benjamin, the remnant of God's people who were to continue a kingdom after the final captivity of the Israelites. It begins with a favorable prognostication of their affairs under Hezekiah; but soon changes to reproofs and threatenings for their intemperance, disobedience, and profaneness. <\/p>,\n\n <p>Jonathan's Targum on this verse is worthy of notice: \"In that time Messiah, the Lord of hosts <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05e6\u05d1\u05d0\u05d5\u05ea \u05d3\u05d9\u05d9 \u05de\u05e9\u05d9\u05d7\u05d0 <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">,meshicha dayai tsebaoth <\/span>,, shall be a crown of joy and a diadem of praise to the residue of his people.\" Kimchi says the rabbins in general are of this opinion. Here then the rabbins, and their most celebrated Targum, give the incommunicable name, <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05e6\u05d1\u05d0\u05d5\u05ea \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d4 <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">,Yehovah tsebaoth <\/span>,, the Lord of hosts, to our ever blessed Redeemer, Jesus Christ. <\/p>,",
