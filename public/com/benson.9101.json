By the <i>holy mountain <\/i> he means, the Christian Church, frequently termed <i>Zion, Jerusalem, <\/i> and God\u2019s <i>holy mountain, <\/i> in the writings of the prophets. Wherever the gospel comes and prevails; wherever the true and genuine religion of Christ takes place and is established, these effects are produced. And in due time the gospel shall prevail, and the true religion of Jesus be established everywhere. <i>For the earth <\/i>\u2014The world, with its inhabitants, <i>shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord <\/i>\u2014By this he intimates, that all that savageness and malignity which are in carnal and wicked men toward the people of God, and all those unholy, unkind, and unhappy dispositions which are in any of the human race, proceed from their ignorance of God, or their want of a true and saving acquaintance with him, which, wherever it takes place, produces a marvellous and thorough change in men\u2019s hearts and lives. <i>As the waters cover the sea <\/i>\u2014As the waters spread themselves over the bottom, and entirely fill all the channels of the sea. Although this prophecy begins to be fulfilled wherever the kingdom of grace is set up among men, and is more and more fulfilled in proportion as that kingdom is enlarged; yet the perfect accomplishment of it will not be witnessed till those latter days come, when, according to the Scriptures, the knowledge and practice of Christianity will be universally diffused, and all those divine virtues which it inculcates will be most eminently exerted and displayed. <\/p> ",
