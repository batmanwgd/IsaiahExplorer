So in <a class=\"ref\">2 Chronicles 32:5 <\/a>: \u201cHezekiah built up all the wall that was broken, and raised it up to the towers,\u201d and added an outer line of defence. The \u201ccity of David\u201d is, of course, the fortress of Zion. <\/p> \n <p>The waters of the lower pool.\u2014This was the Lower Gihon, now the Birket-es-Sultan. The operation is described more fully in <a class=\"ref\">2 Chronicles 32:3-4 <\/a>. Its object was to stop the outflow of the streams, and gather them into a reservoir, partly, of course, for the supply of the inhabitants during the siege, but still more that the Assyrian armies might find little or no water in the immediate neighbourhood of the city. Sargon, in his inscriptions, describes like preparations at Ashdod (Smith, Assyr. Discov., p. 291). <\/p> ",
