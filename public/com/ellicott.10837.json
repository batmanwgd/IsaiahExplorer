Viewed from the standpoint of a later revelation, devout thinkers have naturally seen in it an allusive reference to the glory of Jehovah as seen alike in the past, the present, and the future, which seems the leading idea in <a class=\"ref\">Revelation 4:8<\/a>, or even a faint foreshadowing of the Trinity of Persons in the Unity of the Godhead. Historically we cannot separate it from the name of the Holy One of Israel, which with \u201cthe Lord of hosts\u201d was afterwards so prominent in Isaiah\u2019s teaching. <\/p>",
