As multitudes of people are often spoken of in Scripture under the emblem of great waters, so an invading army is very fitly represented by the inundation of a rapid river, which carries all before it, and leaves the ground waste and desolate. <i>And he shall pass through Judah <\/i>\u2014Having overrun the land of Israel he shall invade the land of Judah, as Sennacherib did a few years after the conquest of Samaria by Shalmaneser; see <a class=\"ref\">2 Kings 18:9; 2 Kings 18:13 <\/a>. And <i>he shall reach even to the neck <\/i>\u2014So that they shall be in great danger of being destroyed. He persists in the metaphor of a river swelling so high as to reach to a man\u2019s neck, and be ready to overwhelm him. Such was the danger of Judah\u2019s land <i>when Sennacherib took all the fenced cities of Judah, <\/i>,(<a class=\"ref\">2 Kings 18:13 <\/a>,,) and sent his army against the capital city of Jerusalem. <i>The stretching out of his wings <\/i>\u2014Of his forces, or of the wings of his army, as they anciently were, and still are, called. <i>Shall fill the breadth of thy land <\/i>\u2014Of the land of Judah, so called, because the Messiah, who is called Immanuel, (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3Nzk3XQ==\">Isaiah 7:14 <\/a>,,) should certainly be born, and live, and die there. And this is added emphatically for the consolation of God\u2019s people, to assure them, that notwithstanding this dreadful scourge, yet God would make a difference between Israel and Judah; and whereas Israel should be so broken by the Assyrian, that <i>they should not be a people, <\/i>,Judah should be restored, for the sake of the Messiah, to be the place of his birth and ministry, according to <a class=\"ref\">Genesis 49:10 <\/a>. <\/p>,",
