Although Zenos refers to the whole vineyard, and not just the \"pleasant plant\" of Judah as designated by Isaiah, both conditions show that the Lord gives full opportunity within the framework of man's agency, wherein man must choose and do his part.<\/p>     <p>(Note: The commentary for 5:8-23 is offered in light of Nephi's admonition to liken the scriptures unto ourselves [see <a class=\"ref\">1 Ne. 19:23<\/a>]. These warnings refer to conditions similar to those which caused the destruction of Judah and Israel, and which will likewise bring the destruction of the wicked at the Second Coming.)<\/p>     ",
