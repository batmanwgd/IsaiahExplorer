Yet instead of command he employs the metaphor<i>hiss<\/i> , in allusion to the climate of those kingdoms of which he speaks; for Egypt abounds in flies, because the country is hot and marshy; and when the air is both hot and moist, there must be produced a great abundance of flies. Assyria, on the other hand, abounded in bees; and when he says that he will bring them by a<i>hiss<\/i> , he alludes to the natural habits of bees and flies, but he means that he will find no difficulty in sending them. As if he had said, \u201cThere will be no need of great exertion; for as soon as I shall give the sign, they will instantly run.\u201d In this manner he shows what efficacy belongs to his secret operation or design, that by a<i>hiss<\/i> he compels the most powerful nations to yield obedience.<\/p> ",
