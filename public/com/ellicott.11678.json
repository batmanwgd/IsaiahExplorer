    "html": "<p>             (8) He was taken from prison . . .\u2014The Hebrew preposition admits of this rendering, which is adopted by many commentators, as describing the oppression and iniquitous trial which had preceded the death of the servant. It admits equally of the sense, through oppression and through judgment; and, on the whole, this gives a preferable sense. The whole procedure was tainted with iniquity.<\/p>\n <p>Who shall declare his generation?\u2014The words are, perhaps, the most difficult of the whole section, and have been very differently explained: (1) \u201cWho shall declare his life, the mystery of his birth, his eternal being?\u201d (2) \u201cWho shall count his spiritual offspring?\u201d as in <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 22:30<\/a>. (3) \u201cAs to his generation (i.e., his contemporaries, as in <a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 2:31<\/a>), who will consider rightly?\u201d (4) \u201cWho shall set forth his generation in all the intensity of their guilt?\u201d\u2014to say nothing of other renderings, which render the noun as \u201chis dwelling,\u201d i.e., the grave, or his \u201ccourse of life,\u201d or his \u201cfate.\u201d Of these (3) seems most in harmony with the context, the words that follow pointing to the fact which ought to have been considered, and was not, that though the Servant of Jehovah was smitten, it was not for his own sins, but theirs.<\/p>",
