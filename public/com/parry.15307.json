Thus it would symbolize the complete destruction of the wicked at the Lord's coming.<\/p> <p><i>as<\/i> <i>thorns cut up shall they be burned in the fire. <\/i>Thorns and weeds are burned to prevent them from overcoming useful plants. When they are cut down and placed in a pile, the fire becomes fiercer and hotter, and they burn more easily. Such will be the burning of the wicked at Christ's second coming: Sinners will burn as easily as thorns are consumed in a fire.<\/p> ",
