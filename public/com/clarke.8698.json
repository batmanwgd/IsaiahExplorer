This word is rather of doubtful derivation and signification. It occurs only in this place: and some of the ancient interpreters seem to have had something different in their copies. The Vulgate read <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d4\u05ea\u05d1\u05e9\u05e9\u05d5 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">hithbosheshu<\/span>, take shame to yourselves; the Syriac <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d4\u05ea\u05d1\u05d5\u05e0\u05e0\u05d5 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">hithbonenu<\/span>, consider with yourselves; the Septuagint <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03bd\u03b1\u03be\u03b5\u03c4\u03b5\u0387<\/span>  perhaps <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d4\u05ea\u05d0\u05d1\u05dc\u05d5 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">hithabbelu<\/span>, groan or mourn, within yourselves.
