    "html": " <p>We have here a vindication of God's dealings with the Jews, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODk5LDE4OTAwXQ==\">Isaiah 65:1, Isaiah 65:2<\/a>. To this end the prophet points out their great hypocrisy, and gives a particular enumeration of their dreadful abominations, many of which were committed under the specious guise of sanctity, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODkwMSI6M30=\">Isaiah 65:3-5<\/a>. For their horrid impieties, (recorded in writing before Jehovah), the wrath of God shall certainly come upon them to the uttermost; a prediction which was exactly fulfilled in the first and second centuries in the reigns of the Roman emperors Vespasian, Titus, and Hadrian, when the whole Jewish polity was dissolved, and the people dispersed all over the world, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4OTA0LDE4OTA1XQ==\">Isaiah 65:6, Isaiah 65:7<\/a>. Though God had rejected the Jews, and called the Gentiles, who sought him not, (<a class=\"ref\">Romans 9:24-26<\/a>;), yet a remnant from among the former shall be preserved, to whom he will in due time make good all his promises, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODkwNiI6M30=\">Isaiah 65:8-10<\/a>. Denunciation of Divine vengeance against those idolaters who set in order a table for Gad, and fill out a libation to Meni, ancient idolatries, which, from the context, and from the chronological order of the events predicted, have a plain reference to the idolatries practiced by Antichrist under the guise of Christianity, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4OTA5LDE4OTEwXQ==\">Isaiah 65:11, Isaiah 65:12<\/a>. Dreadful fate which awaits these gross idolaters beautifully contrasted with the great blessedness reserved for the righteous, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODkxMSI6NH0=\">Isaiah 65:13-16<\/a>. Future restoration of the posterity of Jacob, and the happy state of the world in general from that most glorious epoch, represented by the strong figure of the creation of new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness, and into which no distress shall be permitted to enter, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODkxNSI6M30=\">Isaiah 65:17-19<\/a>. In this new state of things the term of human life shall be greatly protracted, and shall possess none of that uncertainty which attaches to it in \"the heavens and the earth which are now.\" This is elegantly illustrated by the longevity of a tree; manifestly alluding to the oak or cedar of Lebanon, some individuals of which are known to have lived from seven to ten centuries, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODkxOCI6NH0=\">Isaiah 65:20-23<\/a>. Beautiful figures shadowing forth the profound peace and harmony of the Church of Jesus Christ, which shall immediately follow the total overthrow of Antichrist; with a most gracious promise that the great chain of Omnipotence shall be put upon every adversary, so that none will be able any longer to hurt and destroy in all God's holy mountain, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4OTIyLDE4OTIzXQ==\">Isaiah 65:24, Isaiah 65:25<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n <p>This chapter contains a defense of God's proceedings in regard to the Jews, with reference to their complaint in the chapter preceding. God is introduced declaring that he had called the Gentiles, though they had not sought him; and had rejected his own people for their refusal to attend to his repeated call; for their obstinate disobedience, their idolatrous practices, and detestable hypocrisy. That nevertheless he would not destroy them all; but would preserve a remnant, to whom he would make good his ancient promises. Severe punishments are threatened to the apostates; and great rewards are promised to the obedient in a future flourishing state of the Church.\u2014L. <\/p>",
