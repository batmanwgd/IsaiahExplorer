    "html": " <i>seraphim.<\/i> The term <i>seraphim<\/i> comes from the Hebrew root <i>sarap,<\/i> which means \"to burn,\" and refers to a class of angels who are located in the celestial kingdom. English translations of its plural form may read \"burning ones,\" or \"bright shiny ones,\" both of which describe their glorious condition and location near God's throne. A modern revelation speaks of the \"bright, shining seraphs around [God's] throne\" who shout \"acclamations of praise, singing Hosanna to God and the Lamb!\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 109:79<\/a>), some of whom are premortal spirits (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 38:1<\/a>). <\/p> <p><i>six<\/i> <i>wings.<\/i> Each living being seen by Ezekiel (Ezek. 1:9-11) and John (Rev. 4:8) in their visions had wings. The seraphim's wings are probably not literal but may be a \"representation of power, to move, to act, etc.\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 77:4<\/a>). <\/p> <p><i>covered his face\/feet.<\/i> Perhaps the seraphim covered their faces to protect themselves from the glory of God, which was present in the throne room of the celestial temple.<\/p> ",
