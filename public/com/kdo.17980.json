    "html": "<p> This intimidating message, which declared the God of Israel to be utterly powerless, was conveyed by the messengers of Sennacherib in the form of a latter. <em> \u201cAnd Hizkiyahu took the letter out of the hand of the messengers, and read it <\/em> (K.<em> read them<\/em> )<em> , and went up to the house of Jehovah; and Hizkiyahu spread it before Jehovah.\u201d<\/em> <em> S e pha\u0302r\u0131\u0304m <\/em> (the sheets) is equivalent to <em> the letter<\/em> (not a letter <em> in duplo<\/em> ), like <em> literae <\/em> (cf., <em> grammata <\/em> ). \u05d5\u05d9\u05bc\u05e7\u05e8\u05d0\u05d4\u05d5\u05bc (changed by K. into m- ' ) is construed according to the singular idea. Thenius regards this spreading out of the letter as a <em> naivet\u00e9<\/em> ; and Gesenius even goes so far as to speak of the praying machines of the Buddhists. But it was simply prayer without words - an act of prayer, which afterwards passed into vocal prayer. <em> \u201cAnd Hizkiyahu prayed to <\/em> (K. <em> before<\/em> )<em> Jehovah, saying <\/em> (K. <em> and said<\/em> ),<em> Jehovah of hosts <\/em> (K. omits <em> ts e bha\u0302'o\u0304th <\/em> ),<em> God of Israel, enthroned upon the cherubim, Thou, yea Thou alone, art God of all the kingdoms of the earth; Thou, Thou hast made the heavens and the earth. Incline Thine ear, Jehovah, and hear <\/em> \u05d5\u05bc\u05e9\u05c1\u05de\u05e2 , various reading in both texts \u05d5\u05bc\u05e9\u05c1\u05de\u05e2 )! <em> Open Thine eyes <\/em> (K. with <em> Yod<\/em> of the plural),<em> Jehovah, and see; and hear the<\/em> (K. <em> all the<\/em> )<em> words of Sennacherib, which he hath sent <\/em> (K. <em> with which he hath sent him,<\/em> i.e., Rabshakeh)<em> to despise the living God! Truly, O Jehovah, the kings of Asshur have laid waste all lands, and their land <\/em> (K. <em> the nations and their land<\/em> ),<em> and have put <\/em> (<em> v e na\u0302tho\u0304n <\/em> , K. <em> v e na\u0302th e nu\u0304 <\/em> )<em> their gods into the fire: for they were not gods, only the work of men's hands, wood and stone; therefore they have destroyed them. And now, Jehovah our God, help us <\/em> (K. adds <em> pray<\/em> )<em> out of his hand, and all the kingdoms of the earth may know that Thou Jehovah <\/em> (K. <em> Jehovah Elohim<\/em> )<em> art it alone. \u201d<\/em> On \u05db\u05bc\u05e8\u05d1\u05d9\u05dd (no doubt the same word as \u03b3\u03c1\u03c5\u03c0\u03b5\u0301\u03c2 , though not fabulous beings like these, but a symbolical representation of heavenly beings), see my <em> Genesis<\/em> , p. 626; and on <em> yo\u0304she\u0304bh hakkerubh\u0131\u0304m <\/em> (enthroned on the cherubim), see at <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 18:11<\/a> and <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 80:2<\/a>. \u05d4\u05d5\u05bc\u05d0 in \u05d0\u05ea\u05bc\u05d4\u05be\u05d4\u05d5\u05bc\u05d0 is an emphatic repetition, that is to say a strengthening, of the subject, like <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODUzMSwxODY4Niw4MjA5LDIwMTQwLDE0NTc3XSx7IjEyNTE4IjoyfSxbMTIxNDZdXQ==\">Isaiah 43:25; Isaiah 51:12; 2 Samuel 7:28; Jeremiah 49:12; Psalms 44:5; Nehemiah 9:6-7; Ezra 5:11<\/a> : <em> tu ille <\/em> (not <em> tu es ille <\/em> , Ges. \u00a7121, 2) = <em> tu <\/em> , <em> nullus alius <\/em> . Such passages as <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDU2XQ==\">Isaiah 41:4<\/a>, where \u05d4\u05d5\u05bc\u05d0 is the predicate, do not belong here. \u05e2\u05d9\u05df is not a singular (like \u05e2\u05d9\u05e0\u05d9 in <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 32:8<\/a>, where the lxx have \u05e2\u05d9\u05e0\u05d9 ), but a defective plural, as we should expect after <em> pa\u0302qach <\/em> . On the other hand, the reading <em> shela\u0302cho\u0304 <\/em> (\u201chath sent him\u201d), which cannot refer to <em> debha\u0302r\u0131\u0304m <\/em> (the words), but only to the person bringing the written message, is to be rejected. Moreover, Knobel cannot help giving up his preference for the reading <em> v e na\u0302tho\u0304n <\/em> (compare <a class=\"ref\">Genesis 41:43<\/a>; Ges. \u00a7131, 4<em> a<\/em> ); just as, on the other hand, we cannot help regarding the reading \u05d5\u05d0\u05ea\u05be\u05d0\u05e8\u05e6\u05dd \u05d0\u05ea\u05be\u05db\u05bc\u05dc\u05be\u05d4\u05d0\u05e8\u05e6\u05d5\u05ea as a mistake, when compared with the reading of the book of Kings. Abravanel explains the passage thus: \u201cThe Assyrians have devastated the lands, and <em> their<\/em> own land\u201d (cf., <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3OTQ5XQ==\">Isaiah 14:20<\/a>), of which we may find examples in the list of victories given above; compare also <em> Beth-arbel<\/em> in <a class=\"ref\">Hosea 10:14<\/a>, if this is <em> Irbil<\/em> on the Tigris, from which Alexander's second battle in Persia, which was really fought at Gaugamela, derived its name. But how does this tally with the fact that they threw the gods of these lands - that is to say, of their own land also (for \u05d0\u05dc\u05d4\u05d9\u05d4\u05dd could not possibly refer to \u05d4\u05d0\u05e8\u05e6\u05d5\u05ea , to the exclusion of \u05d0\u05e8\u05e6\u05dd ) - into the fire? If we read <em> haggo\u0304y\u0131\u0304m <\/em> (the nations), we get rid both of the reference to their own land, which is certainly purposeless here, and also of the otherwise inevitable conclusion that they burned the gods of their own country. The reading \u05d4\u05d0\u05e8\u05e6\u05d5\u05ea appears to have arisen from the fact, that after the verb \u05d4\u05d7\u05e8\u05d9\u05d1 the lands appeared to follow more naturally as the object, than the tribes themselves (compare, however, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODM0XQ==\">Isaiah 60:12<\/a>). The train of thought is the following: The Assyrians have certainly destroyed nations and their gods, because these gods were nothing but the works of men: do Thou then help us, O Jehovah, that the world may see that Thou alone art it, viz., God (<em> 'Elo\u0304h\u0131\u0304m <\/em> , as K. adds, although, according to the accents, Jehovah Elohim are connected together, as in the books of Samuel and Chronicles, and very frequently in the mouth of David: see <em> Symbolae in Psalmos<\/em> , pp. 15, 16).<\/p>",
