In words reminiscent of 40:27, the people declare that the great promises about the Servant\u2019s ministry are in vain because it is plain that \u201cthe Lord has forgotten\u201d them. To this God replies that he can no more forget them than a nursing mother can forget her baby (49:15\u201316). He goes on to declare that the proof of his love for them will be seen in the abundance of \u201cdescendants\u201d that will be born to Zion when she thought herself forever barren (49:17\u201321). God will cause the nations to bring the lost children home (49:22\u201323).<\/p>     <p>\u2003But these promises elicit another pessimistic answer: Who can break the grip of the captors (49:24)? Again God responds that he can do that very thing (49:25\u201326). The third response is only implicit, but on the basis of God\u2019s response in 50:1\u20133, it seems to be something like: \u201cBut you are the one who (arbitrarily) sold us to those captors in the first place.\u201d To that God responds again that he has not cast them off and has the power to restore them at will.<\/p>     <p>\u2003The language of return here is clearly out of proportion to the actual returns that occurred in 538 and 445 <small>B<\/small>.<small>C<\/small>. Those were relatively small affairs. There certainly was not, as Motyer phrases it, \u201ca population explosion\u201d in the Exile so that more returned than those who went into exile in the first place. So if these statements were intended to be a prediction of literal events, the prophet is sadly mistaken.<\/p>     <p>\u2003But there is good reason to understand that these statements were never intended to be taken literally. As <small>I<\/small> said above, the focus is now on the return <em>to God<\/em>, and Isaiah is speaking figuratively about a worldwide response to God\u2019s reconciliation through the work of the Servant. God has not forgotten his ancient promises to Abraham. The patriarch will indeed have more children than the stars of the heavens or the sand of the seashore. Even if Zion\u2019s sin and exile make it appear as if Abraham\u2019s line has come to an end, that is not the case. Another evidence that the physical returns from Babylon are not in view is the appearance of these same figures of speech in chapters 56\u201366, which have their historical setting in the postexilic period. There the return has already occurred, yet the promises of Zion\u2019s abundant motherhood continue to be made (cf. 60:9; 66:7\u201311, 20).<\/p>     <p>\u2003Once again, the issue of possibility and impossibility is at the heart of what is taking place here. From this world\u2019s perspective, it is impossible for Israel to be restored into a relationship with God. She has been divorced by him (50:1), and her children are either dead or sold into captivity (49:21). A barren, bereaved woman without a man in her life cannot have children. This is a fact of nature. But God insists that not only will the exiled children return (49:17\u201318) but that more children will be born to the mother (49:19\u201321). No wonder the incredulous remark, \u201cWhere have they come from\u201d (49:21)?<\/p>     <p>\u2003The transcendent Creator, who could do a new thing in making Babylon give up the captives, can also do a new thing and get the very nations who threatened the life of Israel to be the ones to assist her in fulfilling her calling to be a blessing to the world. As he promised before (11:10, 12), the Servant\/Messiah will be the banner God raises to call the nations to himself (49:22). They will come gladly, owning their debt to Israel as God\u2019s people (49:23). All of this will confirm two things for the Israelites: Yahweh is indeed the Lord, the one who causes all things to be, and those who \u201cwait for\u201d (NIV \u201chope in\u201d; cf. 30:18) him \u201cwill not be disappointed\u201d (49:23). The God who can defeat the power of all the Assyrias and the Babylons of the world can also defeat the power of sin.<\/p>     <p>\u2003But the astonishing thing is that he cannot do these things for his people if they will not give him an opportunity, by putting their trust in him. As we have said earlier, chapters 40\u201355 focus on the motivation to trust God. Chapters 7\u201339 have amply demonstrated that God can and should be trusted. But ultimately it is only the grace of God that can actually motivate persons to believe what he says and to exercise that trust (cf. 12:1\u20132). This passage is an expression of that grace, reaching its climax in the passionate words of 50:1\u20133, where God insists that he has both the will and the power to redeem his people.<\/p>     <p>\u2003To be sure, it is no accident of history that the Judeans experienced the Exile; it was because of their sin (50:1). But just as no nation on earth can stand up to God, neither can sin. Do they think he has divorced them? Where is the certificate? There is none. Do they think he was somehow forced to \u201csell\u201d them against his will? Of course not. But just as he alone could deliver them from the power of the nations, he alone has the power to deliver from sin. His \u201carm\u201d is not \u201cshort\u201d and weak; rather, it is full-sized and powerful. He can \u201cdry up the sea\u201d and turn off the sun; what is so difficult about defeating sin?<\/p>     <h4>Bridging Contexts<\/h4>     <p>W<small>AITING ON THE<\/small> L<small>ORD<\/small>. The recurring theme throughout this passage is God\u2019s attempt to overcome an unwillingness to believe what he says. This is particularly evident in the contrast between 49:13 and 14. God has promised \u201ccomfort\u201d and \u201ccompassion,\u201d but the people say that it is not true because God has forgotten them. This attitude is reminiscent of what Isaiah encountered in his own day. God had promised deliverance to the people of Judah from the Assyrian threat if they would only \u201cwait\u201d for him. But they had refused to do so, preferring to trust an Assyria to deliver them from the threat of Israel and Syria or an Egypt from the threat of Assyria. Evidently the same tendency was to persist into the Exile, where people gave up on God and turned to accommodating themselves to the Babylonian culture.<\/p>     <p>\u2003The book of Daniel shows that not all of the Judeans succumbed to this pressure, but the book also shows how persistent and pervasive the pressure was. Nebuchadnezzar was king of the universe, and he was not about to permit a \u201cfifth column\u201d close to the center of his empire to suggest that there was a king greater than he. So it was no easy thing to \u201cwait\u201d for the Lord to fulfill his promises.<\/p>     <p>\u2003This was especially true in regard to the promises of the Servant\/Messiah, who would defeat the power of sin and bring in the kingdom of right. It only took a little less than seventy years from the time the first captives were taken in 605 <small>B.C.<\/small> until the first return in 538 <small>B.C.<\/small>, but it took hundreds of years for the Servant to take his throne. Why did God make his people wait so long for the fulfillment of the promise?<\/p>     <p>\u2003While we can talk about further revelation that was necessary before the Messiah could come and the unique possibilities for dissemination of the message that the Roman Empire would make possible, the ultimate answer to that question rested in the mind of God. The only point is that those to whom these promises were made never saw their fulfillment. Nevertheless, some of them waited with faith undimmed for God\u2019s time to be fulfilled. Thus, when Christ came, there were people like Anna and Simeon, who were ready to recognize him (Luke 2:25\u201338). They were the end of a long line of people who had waited confidently, and in the end, their faith was not disappointed (49:23).<\/p>     <h4>Contemporary Significance<\/h4>     <p>W<small>AITING<\/small>. We too are called to live with that confident expectation that is the expression of faith and trust. Waiting believingly is our way of relinquishing control of our lives (see comments on ch. 32). When we rush ahead to solve our problems in our own way without waiting on God to show us how he wants to deal with those problems, we have effectively said to him that we know better than he does and we are better able to solve the problem than he is. This is why Jesus required his disciples to wait in Jerusalem for him to fill them with his Holy Spirit. They and their devices were not the way to carry out Jesus\u2019 command to make disciples of all nations. God was going to use them in dramatic ways to fulfill that purpose, but it was going to be in his way and through his power, not theirs.<\/p>     <p>\u2003But not only are we called upon to wait on God in the daily round of our lives. There is another waiting that is incumbent on us, and it is even more in line with what God was asking of the exiles in this passage. We are called upon to wait as they did for the ultimate fulfillment of the promises made here. In many ways we have seen them fulfilled. All the nations have flowed to Jerusalem and have poured out their wealth and devotion on the city of Zion, the church of the living God. The number of Abraham\u2019s descendants has swelled into the billions. Those who have set out to destroy God\u2019s people have ended up by destroying themselves.<\/p>     <p>\u2003But we still wait for the final establishment of God\u2019s kingdom on earth. That is the confident expectation to which Christ calls his followers. The question of Luke 18:8 is still addressed to us today: \u201cWhen the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on the earth?\u201d In other places, he spoke of the need not to lose focus in our waiting for his return. He spoke of the \u201cfoolish virgins,\u201d who were not prepared for the bridegroom\u2019s coming (Matt. 25:1\u201313). He spoke of those who got busy doing other things and were not ready (Matt. 24:36\u201344).<\/p>     <p>\u2003Already in the years immediately after Jesus\u2019 return to heaven, some lost hope and said he was not coming back. The question for us is whether we will remain in that sort of line that culminated in Anna and Simeon, or whether we will lose hope and effectively finish the line for our family and our descendants. God promises not to disappoint those who wait for him. But that means continuing to wait for as long as he decrees and not losing hope in the meantime.<\/p>     <p>\u2003<b>Accepting God\u2019s love.<\/b> Part of the reason that some of the exiles lost hope was that they could not really believe in God\u2019s love for them. Undoubtedly there were a number of different types of thinking in that group. (1) Some frankly thought that God had treated them unfairly. After all, the people of Judah were not that bad, and there were other people around them who were at least as bad, maybe worse (cf. Hab. 1). Moreover, if their parents had been so bad, as bad as the prophets insisted they had been, then God should have punished them and not their \u201cinnocent\u201d children (Ezek. 18). So this group would say, \u201cIf God loves us so much, we shouldn\u2019t be in this mess at all\u201d (cf. Isa. 40:27).<\/p>     <p>\u2003(2) Others admitted that God had treated them fairly. This generation was just as unfaithful as the preceding ones had been, and God had given them exactly what was coming to them. Being as bad as they were and having failed God so miserably, they could not imagine that God could ever love a people such as them.<\/p>     <p>\u2003(3) Finally, there were those who said, in effect, \u201cSo what?\u201d These people looked at their circumstances and concluded that the situation was hopeless. Whether they had gotten into this fairly or unfairly was beside the point. The point was that there was no way out. So God could say he loved them all he wanted, but it simply would do no good.<\/p>     <p>\u2003Those same groups of people exist today. In every way possible God is saying that he loves us and wants us in fellowship with himself. He promises to give us spiritual abundance and fruitfulness. But we cannot truly \u201chear\u201d his words in the sense of receiving them. (1) Some of us say, \u201cIf God really loved me, he would not have allowed me to be born into this abusive family.\u201d Or, \u201cIf God really loved me, he would not have made me poor.\u201d Or, \u201cIf God really loved me, he wouldn\u2019t have let me get pregnant when we were not married.\u201d (2) Others say, \u201cGod can\u2019t love me, not after what I\u2019ve done.\u201d Or, \u201cGod can\u2019t love me when I just keep on sinning after I said I wouldn\u2019t do it again.\u201d Or, \u201cGod can\u2019t love me; I am just so worthless. Nothing I say or do is worth anything.\u201d (3) Finally, others say, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make any difference whether God loves me or not; my situation is hopeless. He can\u2019t do anything about this.\u201d<\/p>     <p>\u2003To all of these God says the same things as he said 2,700 years ago: He can no more forget us than a mother can forget her nursing baby. And we have even more evidence of that truth than Isaiah did, for when he speaks of our names as being \u201cengraved\u2026on the palms of my hands\u201d (49:16), we think of the nail scars in the hands of God\u2019s Son. When he has done that for us, how could he forget us?<\/p>     <p>\u2003(1) To those among us who believe they have been treated unfairly, he calls them to face their own liability in their situation. Undoubtedly there were individual Judeans who truly did not deserve the Exile. They were people of faith who had been living in obedience to God, yet this terrible thing happened to them (e.g., Daniel and his three friends, and Ezekiel). But the question in that circumstance is not \u201cWhy?\u201d and holding God hostage for an answer. Rather, it is, \u201cWhat now?\u201d and looking to God for resources to go on. For such persons, God\u2019s affirmation of love will be their lifeblood as they seek to cope with the \u201cunfairness\u201d of life. The fact is that we are part of a much larger web of cause and effect than simply our own actions, and if circumstances do not turn out as we might wish, that is no indication that God does not love us or care for us.<\/p>     <p>\u2003(2) The second group longs for God\u2019s love and forgiveness but simply cannot believe that God can forgive them for what they have done. This is often a reverse form of pride: \u201cWhat I have done is too much for God.\u201d It is often also the expression of an inability to forgive oneself. If I am this disappointed in myself, think how infinitely more disappointed God is. What is called for is a radical surrender of oneself into God\u2019s hands. Of course he is disappointed, but that does not change the fact of his love. In the humiliation of admitting that ours is not the worst sin in the world and that our disappointment in ourselves is not the issue, there is a possibility of realizing that God <em>wants<\/em> to forgive us if we will only let him. In receiving that forgiveness, there is finally the possibility of forgiving ourselves.<\/p>     <p>\u2003(3) The situation of the third group is much the same as that of the second: If God\u2019s love is to be experienced, it must be surrendered to. The pride that says \u201cMy situation is hopeless\u201d is one that refuses to believe God is greater than anything this world can present to him. What God asks for is the opportunity to try. He asks us to test him in faith, not in doubt, and to allow him to show us the love he has for us and to demonstrate that love can conquer any obstacle it meets. His arm is not too short to ransom us, nor does he lack the strength to rescue us (50:2).<\/p>     ",
