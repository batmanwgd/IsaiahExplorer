They pretend that he will not punish sin; and hence, they plunge deeply into it, and defy him to punish them. <\/p> <p> <em>Let him make speed <\/em>&mdash;Let him come quick to punish. <\/p> <p> <em>And hasten his work <\/em>&mdash;His punishment. <\/p> <p> <em>That we may see it <\/em>&mdash;An expression of defiance. We would like to see him undertake it. <\/p> <p> <em>The counsel of the Holy One... <\/em>&mdash;His threatened purpose to punish. This is the language of all sinners. They plunge deep into sin; they mock at the threatenings of God; they defy him to do his utmost; they do not believe his declarations. It is difficult to conceive more dreadful and high-handed iniquity than this. <\/p> ",
