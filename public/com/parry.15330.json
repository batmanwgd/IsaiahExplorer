    "html": " <p> Isaiah continues his prophecy concerning the destruction of Edom, or the world (34:1-8). Isaiah's portrayal of the \"burning pitch\" that fills the land of Edom and the billowing smoke that arises \"for ever\" is reminiscent of the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah by fire and brimstone. It presents a picture of terror for the wicked, who will be consumed by the great power of Christ's glory at his second coming.<\/p> <blockquote>And the <i>streams<\/i> thereof shall be turned into <u>pitch<\/u><i>,<\/i>     <br>and the <i>dust<\/i> thereof into <u>brimstone<\/u><i>,<\/i>     <br>and the <i>land<\/i> thereof shall become <u>burning pitch<\/u><i>.<\/i> (34:9)     <br>It shall <i>not<\/i> be <i>quenched<\/i> <u>night nor day<\/u>;     <br>the <i>smoke<\/i> thereof shall go up <u>for ever<\/u>:     <br>from <i>generation to generation<\/i> it shall lie <u>waste<\/u>;     <br><u>none<\/u> shall <u>pass through<\/u> it <i>for ever and ever.<\/i> (34:10)     <br>But the <i>cormorant and the bittern<\/i> shall <u>possess<\/u> it;     <br>the <i>owl also and the raven<\/i> shall <u>dwell in<\/u> it:     <br>and he shall stretch out upon it the <i>line<\/i> of [<u>desolation<\/u>],     <br>and the [<i>plummet<\/i>] of <u>emptiness<\/u><i>.<\/i> (34:11)     <br>They shall call the <i>nobles<\/i> thereof to the kingdom, but <u>none shall be there<\/u><i>,<\/i>     <br>and all her <i>princes<\/i> shall be <u>nothing<\/u><i>.<\/i> (34:12)     <br>And <i>thorns<\/i> shall come up in her <u>palaces<\/u><i>,<\/i>     <br><i>nettles and brambles<\/i> in the <u>fortresses<\/u> thereof:     <br>and it shall be an <i>habitation<\/i> of [<u>jackals<\/u>],     <br>and an [<i>enclosure<\/i>] for <u>owls<\/u><i>.<\/i> (34:13)     <br>The <i>wild beasts<\/i> of the desert shall also <u>meet with the wild beasts<\/u> of the island,     <br>and the <i>satyr<\/i> shall <u>cry to his fellow<\/u>;     <br>the <i>screech owl<\/i> also shall <u>rest<\/u> there,     <br>and find for <i>herself<\/i> a place of <u>rest<\/u><i>.<\/i> (34:14)     <br>There shall the great <i>owl<\/i> make her nest, and lay, and hatch, and <u>gather<\/u> under her shadow:     <br>there shall the <i>vultures<\/i> also be <u>gathered, every one with her mate<\/u><i>.<\/i> (34:15)<\/blockquote> ",
