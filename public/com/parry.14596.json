His vision was not a simple, ordinary dream. Joseph Smith, when he spoke of Isaiah and other persons from the Bible, taught that the great visions received by the ancients came after they had received the Second Comforter. <\/p> <p><i>son of Amoz.<\/i> According to the Jewish authority Kimchi, Amoz, not to be confused with the prophet Amos, was \"the brother of Amaziah, the father of Uzziah,&hellip;[which] would make Isaiah of royal lineage and a cousin of Uzziah,\" king of Judah. <\/p> <p><i>Judah and Jerusalem.<\/i> The vision of Isaiah deals with Judah and Jerusalem, but Isaiah's prophecies also deal with the entire house of Israel, including the lost ten tribes, as the Book of Mormon abundantly testifies. Nephi commands, \"Hear ye the words of the prophet [Isaiah],&hellip;which were written unto all the house of Israel\" (<a class=\"ref\">1 Ne. 19:24; 2 Ne. 6:5<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\">3 Ne. 23:2<\/a>). <\/p> <p><i> kings of Judah.<\/i> These were Uzziah (784-740 b.c.), Jotham (740-735 b.c.), Ahaz (735-715 b.c.), and Hezekiah (715-687 b.c.). Many scholars believe that Isaiah ministered between the years 740 and 700 b.c.<\/p> ",
