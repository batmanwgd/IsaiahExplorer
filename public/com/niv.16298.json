If the people tended to blame God for their hard-heartedness, at least they did not minimize the reality of their condition. They could not have a relationship with God and fulfill their mandate of being a light to the nations as long as they continued to live lives that were a reproach to his holy character. They are \u201cunclean\u201d; even the \u201crighteous\u201d things they do are defiled and contaminated (64:6). This underlines the Old Testament understanding that sin is not first of all behavioral dysfunction but rather an offense against the very nature of life, which finally must end in death and decay.<\/p>     <p>\u2003This thought is continued with the image of a dead leaf swept away on a wind of sin. Further reflection occurs in 64:7. What is it to be among the people of God? How is one\u2019s life to be lived out in a believer? Is it a matter of discipline and commitment? No, first of all it is a matter of laying \u201chold\u201d of God, of calling on his \u201cname.\u201d It is to be in a vital relationship of dependence and self-renunciation. When that is so, right behavior will follow. But if right behavior becomes the focus, that behavior quickly becomes self-serving and is reduced to nothing more than \u201cfilthy rags.\u201d God\u2019s \u201cface\u201d cannot help but be \u201chidden\u201d from such people, and they are left to \u201cwaste away\u201d in their \u201csins\u201d (64:7). Here we are at the conundrum again: We are wasting away in our sins because we won\u2019t turn to you, and we won\u2019t turn to you because you have hidden your face from us. What is to be done?<\/p>     ",
