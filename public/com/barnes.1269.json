    "html": " <p> <em>For <\/em>&mdash;This verse is to be understood as a response to what the complaining and dissatisfied people had said, as expressed in the previous verse. God says that he will teach them, but it should be by another tongue&mdash;a foreign language in a distant land. Since they refused to hearken to the messages which he sent to them, and which they regarded as adapted only to children, he would teach them in a manner that should be &ldquo;much more&rdquo; humiliating; he would make use of the barbarous language of foreigners to bring them to the true knowledge of God. <\/p> <p> <em>With stammering lips <\/em>&mdash;The word which is used here is derived from a verb (\u05dc\u05e2\u05d2 la\u0302\u201ba\u0302g), which means to speak unintelligibly: especially to speak in a foreign language, or to stammer; and then to mock, deride, laugh at, scorn (compare <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4Mjk5XQ==\">Isaiah 33:19 <\/a>; <a class=\"ref\">Proverbs 1:26; Proverbs 17:5; Psalm 2:4; Psalm 59:9; Job 22:19 <\/a>). Here it means in a foreign or barbarous tongue; and the sense is, that the lessons which God wished to teach would be conveyed to them through the language of foreigners&mdash;the Chaldeans. They should be removed to a distant land, and there, in hearing a strange speech, in living long among foreigners, they should learn the lesson which they refused to do when addressed by the prophets in their own land. <\/p> ",
