    "html": " <p>Imbued with the knowledge of God, Jehovah&rsquo;s servant seeks to wake up Jehovah&rsquo;s people as he is awake (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NjgzXQ==\">Isaiah 51:9 <\/a>). Those who need waking up include their prophets and seers: &ldquo;Jehovah has poured out on you a spirit of deep sleep: he has shut your eyes, the prophets; he has covered your heads, the seers&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MjA0XQ==\">Isaiah 29:10 <\/a>); &ldquo;Their watchmen are altogether blind and unaware; all of them are but dumb watchdogs unable to bark, lolling seers fond of slumber&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzY0XQ==\">Isaiah 56:10 <\/a>). With the servant&rsquo;s coming, many of Jehovah&rsquo;s people wake up and are reborn on higher spiritual levels (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODY5MV0seyIxODY5OCI6Mn1d\">Isaiah 51:17; 52:1-2 <\/a>). <\/p> <p>The &ldquo;weary&rdquo; to whom Jehovah&rsquo;s servant preaches identifies the Jacob\/Israel category of Jehovah&rsquo;s people (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg0NDgiOjR9LFsxODUyOF1d\">Isaiah 40:27-30; 43:22 <\/a>). A chaos motif, weariness implies failure to keep the law of Jehovah&rsquo;s covenant, with covenant curses following (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgxMDEiOjJ9LHsiMTg1MDIiOjV9XQ==\">Isaiah 24:5-6; 42:21-25 <\/a>). Unlike the servant, who &ldquo;rebels not&rdquo; nor &ldquo;backs away&rdquo; from Jehovah, many do so: &ldquo;They are a rebellious people, sons who break faith, children unwilling to obey the law of Jehovah&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MjI3XQ==\">Isaiah 30:9 <\/a>; cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODc3XQ==\">63:10 <\/a>); &ldquo;We perceive our iniquities: willfully denying Jehovah, backing away from following our God&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODgxMyI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 59:12-13 <\/a>; cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NjU5XQ==\">1:4 <\/a>). <\/p> ",
