    "html": " <i>desert shall&hellip;blossom as the rose.<\/i> Isaiah equates the desert to Israel, an important point to understanding this chapter; here he prophesies that the desert shall blossom, just as earlier he had prophesied that Israel shall blossom (see commentary on 27:6, 10). For Isaiah's prophetic world, the words <i>desert<\/i> and <i>wilderness<\/i> relate not only to a barren and desolate land but to a people or nation (1:30) who lack the living waters of Jesus Christ. When Isaiah prophesies that the desert shall blossom as the rose, he refers to the restoration of the gospel: \"Israel shall blossom and bud, and fill the face of the world with fruit\" (27:6), \"Jacob shall flourish in the wilderness\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 49:24<\/a>), and the full blessings of the temple shall again be made available.<\/p> <p>After the death of Jesus and his apostles, the Church was driven \"into the wilderness\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 86:3<\/a>), but with the restoration of the gospel we have witnessed \"the coming forth of [the Lord's] church out of the wilderness\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 5:14<\/a>). We, the house of Israel, are no longer a desert but are flourishing and filling \"the face of the world with fruit\" (27:6). We drink deeply of the waters of Christ (58:11).<\/p> ",
