Soldiers and warriors are merciless; they slay young men during the war. The Revised Standard Version translates the phrase: \"their bows will slaughter the young men.\"<\/p> <p><i>no pity on the fruit of the womb.<\/i> The cruel and unfeeling soldiers will also slay <i>the fruit of the womb,<\/i> a common biblical idiom for children (<a class=\"ref\">Gen. 30:2; Deut. 7:13<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\">Ps. 127:3<\/a>). The phrase also suggests the slaying of pregnant women and their unborn children.<\/p> <p><i>eyes shall not spare children.<\/i> No one will be spared during the wars. Invading armies will look for even small children to murder so that future generations will not arise in rebellion to avenge their parents' deaths.<\/p> ",
