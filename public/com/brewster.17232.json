This was the home of a wealthy counselor and disciple of Jesus, named Joseph. Following the death of Christ, Joseph received permission from Pilate to take the body of Jesus for burial. Joseph wrapped it in clean linen cloth and then \"laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock\" in a hillside just outside Jerusalem.
