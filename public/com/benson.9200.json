Afterward it is called by Joshua, <i>great Zidon, <\/i><a class=\"ref\">Joshua 11:8<\/a> : Homer likewise takes notice of Zidon, but not of Tyre; and the authority of Strabo is express to the same purpose.\u201d <i>Arise, pass over to Chittim, <\/i>&c. \u2014 See on <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MDc5XQ==\">Isaiah 23:1<\/a>; <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MDg0XQ==\">Isaiah 23:6<\/a>. \u201cOf all the Phenicians,\u201d says Bishop Newton, \u201cthe Tyrians were the most celebrated for their shipping and colonies. Tyre exceeded Zidon in this respect, as Strabo testifies, and sent forth colonies into Africa and Spain, unto and beyond the pillars of Hercules: and Quintus Curtius says that her colonies were diffused almost over the whole world. The Tyrians, therefore, having planted colonies at Tarshish, and upon the coasts of Chittim, it was natural for them, when they were pressed with dangers and difficulties at home, to flee to their friends and countrymen abroad for protection. That they really did so, St. Jerome asserts, upon the authority of Assyrian histories, which are now lost. But,\u201d it is here foretold, that, \u201cthough they should pass over to Chittim, yet even there they should find no quiet settlement; <i>There also shalt thou have no rest <\/i>\u2014 Megasthenes (an historian who lived about 300 years before Christ) is quoted by several ancient authors, for saying that Nebuchadnezzar subdued a great part of Africa and Spain, and proceeded as far as the pillars of Hercules. After he had subdued Tyre and Egypt, we may suppose he carried his arms further westward; and if he proceeded as far as Megasthenes reports, the Tyrians might well be said to <i>have no rest, <\/i>their conqueror pursuing them from one country to another. But besides this, and after this, the Carthaginians, and other colonies of the Tyrians, lived in a very unsettled state. Their history is made up of little but wars and tumults, even before their three fatal wars with the Romans, in every one of which their affairs grew worse and worse. Sicily and Spain, Europe and Africa, the land, and their own element, the sea, were theatres of their calamities and miseries; till, at last, not only the new, but old Carthage too, was utterly destroyed. As the Carthaginians sprung from the Tyrians, and the Tyrians from the Zidonians, and Zidon was the firstborn of Canaan, (<a class=\"ref\">Genesis 10:15<\/a>,) so the curse upon Canaan seems to have pursued them to the most distant parts of the earth.\u201d<\/p>",
