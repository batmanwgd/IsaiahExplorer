In the same way, the restoration of Israel will usher in not only a symbolic but an actual renewal of the <i>earth. <\/i>The context of this chapter tells us that this renewal refers not to the celestialized earth but to the millennial condition referred to in the tenth Article of Faith: \"The earth will be renewed and receive its paradisiacal glory\" (see also <a class=\"ref\">2 Pet. 3:10-13; Rev. 21:1-4<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 101:23-25<\/a>). <\/p> <p><i>former shall not be remembered.<\/i> The changes in the earth will be so significant and remarkable that they will essentially remove all thought of the premillennial world. This statement refers both to the earth itself, which will be transformed into a paradisiacal state, and to mortal conditions on the earth.<\/p> ",
