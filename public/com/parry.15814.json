    "html": " <p><i> <a class=\"ref\">Isa. 57<\/a> contains a description of gross idol worship and temple prostitution. Israel seemed to go out of her way to offend the Lord by participating in religious practices that not only rejected him but also caused them to commit the very sins that were most abhorrent to him.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>One message of Isaiah seems to be a reminder of the first of the Ten Commandments: \"Thou shalt have no other gods before me\" (<a class=\"ref\">Ex. 20:3<\/a>). It is not only the abhorrent that can turn our hearts. Even good things can take us away from God. We let other things become our God when we give them first place in our lives, whether the primary object of our affection is our family, work, money, recreation, sports, or a particular sin.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>The Lord concludes by reminding us of his mercy when we repent. We will be gathered to Zion; he will heal us and comfort us and remove obstacles from our way.<\/i><\/p> ",
