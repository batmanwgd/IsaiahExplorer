By such expressions as these, which represent all the plurality of the divine nature as inherent in the One, the religion of revelation, both Israelitish and Christian, exhibits itself as embodying all that is true in polytheism. He who has entered into the relation of husband to Jerusalem ( \u05d1\u05e2\u05dc\u05d9 \u05da , not \u05d1\u05e2\u05dc\u05d9\u05da , <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NjU4XQ==\">Isaiah 1:3<\/a>) is the very same through whom she first came into existence, the God whose bidding the heavenly hosts obey; and the Redeemer of Jerusalem, the Holy One of Israel, is called the God of the whole earth, and therefore has both the power and the means to help her, as prompted by the relation of love which exists between them.<\/p>",
