It has to be remembered, however, that the prophet spoke to those who were unjust and selfish, and who were as yet far from the broken and contrite heart of the true penitent. He was content to wake up in them the dormant sense of righteousness, and to lead them to recognise the moral government of God. In the long run they would not be losers by a change of conduct. The choice of eating or \u201cbeing eaten\u201d (the \u201cdevoured\u201d of <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3Njc1XQ==\">Isaiah 1:20 <\/a>), enjoying a blameless prosperity, or falling by the sword, was placed before those to whom the higher aspirations of the soul were little known. Such is, at all times, one at least of the methods of God\u2019s education of mankind. <\/p>,",
