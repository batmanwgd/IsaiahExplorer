The judgment of the world comes again before his mind. - <em> \u201cJehovah has appeared to plead, and stands up to judge the nations.\u201d<\/em> When Jehovah, weary with His long-suffering, rises up from His heavenly throne, this is described as \u201cstanding up\u201d (<em> kum <\/em> , <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzA1LDE3NzA3LDE4MjkwXQ==\">Isaiah 2:19, Isaiah 2:21; Isaiah 33:10<\/a>); and when He assumes the judgment-seat in the sight of all the world, this is called \u201csitting down\u201d (<em> yashab <\/em> , <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 9:5, Joel 3:12<\/a>); when, having come down from heaven (<a class=\"ref\">Micah 1:2<\/a>.), He comes forward as accuser, this is called \u201cstanding\u201d (<em> nizzab <\/em> or <em> amad <\/em> , <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 82:1<\/a> : <em> amad <\/em> is coming forward and standing, as the opposite of sitting; <em> nizzab <\/em> , standing, with the subordinate idea of being firm, resolute, ready). This pleading (<em> ribh <\/em> , <a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 25:31<\/a>) is also judging (<em> din <\/em> ), because His accusation, which is incontrovertible, contains the sentence in itself; and His sentence, which executes itself irresistibly, is of itself the infliction of punishment. Thus does he stand in the midst of the nations at once accuser, judge, and executioner (<a class=\"ref\">Psalms 7:8<\/a>). But among the nations it is more especially against Israel that He contends; and in Israel it is more especially against the leaders of the poor misguided and neglected people that He sets Himself.<\/p>",
