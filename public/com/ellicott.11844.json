Here, however (as in <a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 18:6<\/a>), another aspect is presented to us, and the power of the Great Potter is made the ground of prayer. The \u201cclay\u201d entreats Him to fashion it according to His will, and has faith in His readiness, as well as His power, to comply with that prayer. The thought of the \u201cpotter\u201d becomes, in this aspect of it, one with that of the Fatherhood of God. <\/p>",
