    "html": "<p>The &ldquo;messenger&rdquo; who announces good tidings primarily identifies Jehovah&rsquo;s end-time servant (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 41:27; 44:26<\/a>). It additionally identifies Zion&rsquo;s watchmen (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzA1XQ==\">v 8<\/a>) and Zion\/Jerusalem (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 40:9<\/a>)&mdash;all those to whom the servant ministers (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 61:1, 3<\/a>). Parallelism of the terms &ldquo;peace,&rdquo; &ldquo;good,&rdquo; and &ldquo;salvation&rdquo; reveals them as synonyms. All three comprise covenant blessings that flow from covenant keeping: (1) &ldquo;peace&rdquo; is engendered by Jehovah (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 26:3, 12; 53:5<\/a>); (2) &ldquo;good&rdquo; comes from proving loyal to him (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 38:3; 55:1-7<\/a>); and (3) &ldquo;salvation&rdquo; is wrought by him (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 33:2; 43:12<\/a>).<\/p><p>As the term &ldquo;mountains&rdquo; is a metaphor for nations (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 13:4; 64:1-3<\/a>), the servant&rsquo;s declaring good tidings &ldquo;upon the mountains&rdquo; extends to all nations to whom Jehovah sends him (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 42:1, 4, 6; 49:1, 6<\/a>). His heralding <em>salvation<\/em>&mdash;which Jehovah personifies (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 12:2; 17:10<\/a>)&mdash;means that he declares salvation both as a principle that comes of righteousness (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 26:1-2; 33:14-15<\/a>) and as anticipating Jehovah at his coming (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 25:9; 62:11<\/a>). As King of Zion, Jehovah comes to reign when persons affiliated with Zion become &ldquo;my people&rdquo; and he becomes &ldquo;your God&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg3MDMiOjJ9LFsxODQyMiwxODQyNF1d\">vv 6-7; Isaiah 40:1, 3<\/a>).<\/p>",
