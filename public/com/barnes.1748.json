    "html": "<p><em>Lift up thine eyes round about<\/em>&mdash;That is, see the multitudes that shall be converted to thee; see thy ruined city rise again in its former beauty; see the Gentiles come and yield themselves to the worship of the true God; see kings and princes approach and do thee homage.<\/p><p><em>All these gather themselves<\/em>&mdash;That is, from a far country, from the north, the west, and the south, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 49:12<\/a>.<\/p><p><em>As I live, saith the Lord<\/em>&mdash;The customary form of an oath when Yahweh swears It is a solemn assurance that the event shall as certainly occur as he has an existence (see the note at <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 45:23<\/a> ; compare <a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 22:24; Ezekiel 5:11; Ezekiel 14:16, Ezekiel 14:18, Ezekiel 14:20; Ezekiel 16:48<\/a>).<\/p><p><em>Thou shalt surely clothe thee with them<\/em>&mdash;Zion is here represented, as it is often elsewhere, as a female (see the note at <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 1:8<\/a>); and the accession of converts from abroad is represented under the figure of bridal ornaments. The accession of converts karo the Gentiles should be to her what jewels are to a bride.<\/p><p><em>And bind them on thee as a bride doth<\/em>&mdash;The sentence here is manifestly incomplete. It means, as a bride binds on her ornaments. The Septuagint has supplied this, and renders it, &lsquo;As a bride her ornaments&rsquo; (&omega;\u0314&sigmaf; &kappa;&omicron;\u0301&sigma;&mu;&omicron;&nu; &nu;&upsilon;\u0301&mu;&phi;&eta; ho\u0304s kosmon numphe\u0304). The sentiment is, that the accession of the large humber of converts under the Messiah to the true church of God, would be the real ornament of Zion, and would greatly increase her beauty and loveliness.<\/p>",
