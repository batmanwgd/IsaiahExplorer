The parallel incidence of &ldquo;nations&rdquo; and &ldquo;thorns&rdquo; connotes the wicked state of the nations after the righteous are withdrawn&mdash;as when the angels removed Lot from Sodom and Gomorrah and only their miscreants remained (<a class=\"ref\">Genesis 19:1-28<\/a> ; cf.<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzY3XQ==\">Isaiah 57:1<\/a>). The worldwide destruction of the wicked&mdash;at which the righteous are delivered from their power&mdash;is Jehovah&rsquo;s doing, as his people at home and abroad come to realize (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODE0MyI6M30=\">Isaiah 26:12-14<\/a>).<\/p> ",
