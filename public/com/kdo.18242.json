    "html": "<p> The seer surmises this also, and now inquires still further, whence the strange red colour of his apparel, which does not look like the purple of a king's talar or the scarlet of a chlamys. <em> \u201cWhence the red on thine apparel, and thy clothes like those of a wine-presser?\u201d<\/em> \u05de\u05d3\u05bc\u05d5\u05bc\u05e2 inquires the reason and cause; \u05dc\u05de\u05bc\u05d4 , in its primary sense, the object or purpose. The seer asks, \u201cWhy is there red (<em> ' a\u0302do\u0304m <\/em> , neuter, like <em> rabh <\/em> in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODc0XQ==\">Isaiah 63:7<\/a>) to thine apparel?\u201d The <em> Lamed<\/em> , which might be omitted (wherefore is thy garment red?), implies that the red was not its original colour, but something added (cf., <a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 30:12<\/a>, and <em> la\u0302mo\u0304 <\/em> in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTQ3LDE4NzIwXQ==\">Isaiah 26:16; Isaiah 53:8<\/a>). This comes out still more distinctly in the second half of the question: \u201cand (why are) thy clothes like those of one who treads (wine) in the wine-press\u201d (<em> b e gath <\/em> with a pausal <em> \u00e1<\/em> not lengthened, like <em> baz <\/em> in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODA5XQ==\">Isaiah 8:1<\/a>), i.e., saturated and stained as if with the juice of purple grapes? <\/p>",
