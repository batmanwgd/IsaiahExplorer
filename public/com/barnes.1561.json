    "html": " <p> <em>Thou shalt fan them <\/em>&mdash;Keeping up the figure commenced in the previous verse. To fan here means to winnow, an operation which was performed by throwing the threshed grain up with a shovel into the air, so that the wind drove the chaff away. So all their enemies, and all the obstacles which were in their way should be scattered. <\/p> <p> <em>And the whirlwind shall scatter them <\/em>&mdash;The ancients believed that people might be swept away by a storm or whirlwind. See <a class=\"ref\">Job 27 <\/a>:p&gt;The cast wind carrieth him away and he departeth; <\/p> <p>And as a storm hurleth him out of his place. <\/p> <p>Compare Homer, Odys. xx. 63ff, thus rendered by Pope: <\/p> <p>Snatch me, ye whirlwinds! far from human race, <\/p> <p>Tost through the void illimitable space; <\/p> <p>Or if dismounted from the rapid cloud, <\/p> <p>Me with his whelming wave let ocean shroud! <\/p> <p>See the notes at <a class=\"ref\">Job 30:22 <\/a>. <\/p> <p> <em>And thou shalt rejoice in the Lord <\/em>&mdash;In view of the aid which he has vouchsafed, and the deliverance which he has performed for you. <\/p> <p> <em>Shalt glory <\/em>&mdash;Shalt boast, or shalt exult. You will regard God as the author of your deliverance, and joy in the proofs of his interposition, and of his gracious protection and care. <\/p> ",
