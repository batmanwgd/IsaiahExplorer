It is a metaphor taken from men who, when they would resolutely and effectually help a person in distress, break through every opposition and obstacle. <i>That the mountains might flow down,<\/i> &c.\u2014Or, <i>melt;<\/i> that all impediments might be removed out of the way. There seems to be an allusion to God\u2019s coming down upon mount Sinai in those terrible flames of fire, <a class=\"ref\"><\/a>. <i>As when the melting fire burneth<\/i>\u2014Come with such zeal for thy people that the solid mountains may be no more before thee than metal that runs, or water that boils by the force of a vehement fire;<i>to make thy name<\/i>\u2014That is, thy power;<i>known to thine adversaries<\/i>\u2014That thine enemies, who are also the enemies of thy people, may know thy power, and that thy name may be dreaded among them.<\/p> ",
