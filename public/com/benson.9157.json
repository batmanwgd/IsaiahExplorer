Upon which wonderful event it is said, ( <a class=\"ref\">2 Chronicles 32:23<\/a> ,) that<i>many brought gifts unto Jehovah, to Jerusalem, and presents to Hezekiah; so that he was magnified of all nations from thenceforth. <\/i> And it is not to be doubted, that among these the Egyptians distinguished themselves in their acknowledgments on this occasion.\u201d These offerings, then made from Egypt and other nations, were a prelude of a more perfect conversion of the Gentiles to the God of Israel; and there is nothing more certain than that God, after the remarkable overthrow of Sennacherib, was<i>like the clear heat after rain,<\/i> and<i>like dew in the time of harvest,<\/i> to the people of Israel.
