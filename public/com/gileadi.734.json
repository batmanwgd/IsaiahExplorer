    "html": " <p>Jehovah&rsquo;s servants&mdash;&ldquo;who are of a humble and contrite spirit and who are vigilant for my word&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4OTI1XQ==\">v 2 <\/a>)&mdash;come under censure by ecclesiastical authorities who feel threatened by their zeal for Jehovah. Such self-righteous &ldquo;brethren&rdquo; (<em>&rsquo;ahekem <\/em>) &ldquo;abhor&rdquo; or &ldquo;hate&rdquo; (<em>son&rsquo;ekem <\/em>) their zealous counterparts and &ldquo;exclude&rdquo; or &ldquo;thrust [them] out&rdquo; (<em>menaddekem <\/em>) from among them, humiliating them. In the end, however&mdash;after it has served Jehovah&rsquo;s purpose of refining his servants and testing their loyalties&mdash;their momentary shame (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODUxXQ==\">Isaiah 61:7 <\/a>) turns into their persecutors&rsquo; everlasting shame (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDYzLDE4OTEzXQ==\">Isaiah 41:11; 65:15 <\/a>). <\/p> <p>The descent phase of those who are ostracized by abusive authorities thus resembles that of Jehovah&rsquo;s servant, whom they similarly &ldquo;abhor&rdquo; and accuse (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODY0NF0seyIxODY3MSI6Mn1d\">Isaiah 49:7; 50:8-9 <\/a>). Both, moreover, follow the pattern of Jehovah himself, whose descent phase includes prosecution by unrighteous authorities (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODcxOSI6M30=\">Isaiah 53:7-9 <\/a>). The latter mock Jehovah&rsquo;s servants by asking them to produce some divine &ldquo;manifestation&rdquo; or sign that justifies their joy-filled zeal: &ldquo;Let him quickly speed up his work so we may see it! Let the plan of the Holy One of Israel soon come to pass, and we will know!&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzU5XQ==\">Isaiah 5:19 <\/a>; cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NTczXQ==\">45:11 <\/a>). <\/p> ",
