We either gather light to our countenance through righteousness or we diminish and darken our countenance through sin. Ultimately, our countenance will reflect the degree of eternal glory we will receive.<\/p>     <p>\"To the wicked, who are filled with darkness, one may ask, 'Where is thy glory?' (<a class=\"ref\">Moses 1:12-14<\/a>.) Yet the righteous 'shall shine forth in the kingdom of God' (<a class=\"ref\">Alma 40:25<\/a>), and of them it will be said they are 'glorious beyond description [with a] countenance truly like lightning' (JS H 1:32).\" (BICQ, 232-33.)<\/p>",
