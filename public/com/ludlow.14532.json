    "html": " <p>Many of Isaiah&rsquo;s prophecies recorded in the Book of Mormon deal with the punishments that come upon the unrighteous. Demonstrating mastery of Hebrew language and poetry, Isaiah uses powerful words and symbolic names to promise ultimate judgment to the wicked&mdash;a sure consequence unless they turn from their evil ways. In Isaiah 8, he describes flood waters of destruction awaiting them unless they return to the gentle waters of inspiration that the Lord offers. Nephi later uses Isaiah&rsquo;s message to teach his people what can happen if they turn away from their God. We can apply these teachings to our lives as we learn from God&rsquo;s witnesses about His judgments and the symbolic meaning of key names and signs.<\/p> ",
