    "html": " <p>, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODIyNCI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 30:6-7 <\/a>. <i>The burden of the beasts of the south <\/i>\u2014The burden of riches or treasures, carried upon beasts travelling southward. In these verses the prophet has before his eyes \u201cthe ambassadors of the Jews, or, as some think, also of Hosea, and the Ephraimites, (see <a class=\"ref\">2 Kings 17:4 <\/a>,,) bearing their splendid and sumptuous presents on asses and camels into Egypt; and perceiving that they would reap no advantage from this proud and sumptuous embassy, and that the whole would be fruitless, or rather would raise the indignation of the Assyrians, he cannot refrain, but exhibits, to the life, the whole scheme of this imprudence, folly, and incredulity, as it was immediately presented to his prophetic sight, with its shameful and sorrowful event.\u201d <i>Into the land of trouble and anguish <\/i>\u2014Into Egypt and Ethiopia, for both were joined together in this matter, (see chap. 20.,) whose land seems to be called a <i>land of trouble, <\/i>,&c., prophetically, because they should distress and not help those that applied to and trusted in them, as was said of the Assyrians in the like case, <a class=\"ref\">2 Chronicles 28:20 <\/a>. Bishop Lowth, who supposes that the deserts are here meant, which the Israelites passed through when they came out of Egypt, renders it, <i>by, <\/i>,or <i>through a land of distress, <\/i>,&c. But it seems more likely, as it certainly was more important, that the land <i>to <\/i>,which, than that <i>through <\/i>,which, they went, should be spoken of. Besides, the direct road from Judea to Egypt was not through such a country as is here described. <i>From whence come the young and old lion, <\/i>,&c.\u2014This may be understood literally, for \u201cEgypt, at this time, joined to Ethiopia, was, of all countries, most fertile of every fierce and wild creature, which the nature of man abhors, both terrestrial and aquatic.\u201d See <i>Boch. Hieroz., <\/i>,p. 2:1. 3. c. 13. The words, however, may have a higher and mystical meaning, and by these wild and savage creatures may be designed the craft and cruelty of the Egyptians and Ethiopians, and the danger and injury the Jews, or Israelites, would bring upon themselves by a confederacy with them. <i>Therefore have I cried concerning this <\/i>\u2014This counsel, or practice; <i>their strength is to sit still <\/i>\u2014It is safer and better for them to stay quietly at home, seeking to God for help, than to go or send to Egypt for it. <\/p>,",
