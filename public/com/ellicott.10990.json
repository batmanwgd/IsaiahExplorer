    "html": " <p>,(21) Prepare slaughter for his children.\u2014Literally, as in <a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 51:40<\/a>, a slaughter house. The command may be addressed to the Medes of <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3OTI0XQ==\">Isaiah 13:17<\/a>, or to any minister of the Divine vengeance. In the judgment of God, as seen in history, that judgment falls necessarily on the last members of an evil and cruel dynasty. In this sense the sins of the fathers are visited on the children, while, in the eternal judgment which lies behind the veil, each single soul stands, as in <a class=\"ref\">Ezekiel 18:4<\/a>, on its own personal responsibility, and may win pardon for itself. Penitent or impenitent (and the latter seems here implied), the children of the evil-doers should cease to be conquerors and rulers. <\/p>\n <p>Nor fill the face of the world with cities.\u2014The words describe the boast of the great monarchs, who, like Nimrod, built cities to perpetuate their fame. (Comp. <a class=\"ref\">Genesis 10:10-12; Daniel 4:30<\/a>.) The Babylonian and Assyrian kings record their destructive and constructive work with equal exultation (Records of the Past, v., pp. 80, 119, 123). Various readings have been suggested, giving ruined heaps, or terrible ones, or enemies, or conflicts; but there seems no need for any change. <\/p>",
