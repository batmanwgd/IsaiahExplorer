    "html": "<p>At all times, those whom Jehovah &ldquo;blesses&rdquo; are his covenant people who keep the terms of his covenant. In the time of trouble leading up to millennial age of peace, three groups qualify for that privilege: (1) Jehovah&rsquo;s covenanters who dwell in Egypt, whom he acknowledges by the covenant formula &ldquo;my people&rdquo;; (2) descendants of the Ten Tribes who went captive into Assyria, whom he names &ldquo;the work of my hands&rdquo;; and (3) the Jews, who were known as Judah from the time Jehovah&rsquo;s people divided into two nations, but whom Jehovah recognizes as &ldquo;Israel my inheritance&rdquo; when his people reunite.<\/p><p>Jehovah first names the Egyptian covenanters because they minister to all of Israel&rsquo;s tribes in the pattern of Joseph in Egypt. He calls Assyria &ldquo;the work of my <em>hands<\/em>&rdquo; because Israel&rsquo;s Ten Tribes accept his servant&mdash;Jehovah&rsquo;s right <em>hand<\/em>&mdash;and repudiate the archtyrant&mdash;Jehovah&rsquo;s left <em>hand<\/em>&mdash;at the peril of their lives. Each group inherits the earth, including their former lands of exile: &ldquo;Your entire people shall be righteous; they shall inherit the earth forever&mdash;they are the branch I have planted, the work of my hands, in which I am glorified&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg4NDMiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 60:21<\/a>; cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg2NTUiOjV9LHsiMTg3MjYiOjJ9LHsiMTg5MDciOjF9XQ==\">49:18-22; 54:2-3; 65:9<\/a>).<\/p>",
