Why dost thou give way to such jealousies concerning thy God, of whose infinite power, and wisdom, and goodness, there are such evident demonstrations? <i>My way is hid <\/i>\u2014He takes no notice of my prayers, and tears, and sufferings, but suffers mine enemies to abuse me at their pleasure. This complaint is uttered in the name of the people, being prophetically supposed to be in captivity. <i>My judgment is passed over from my God <\/i>\u2014My cause. God has neglected to plead my cause, and to give judgment for me against mine enemies. <i>Hast thou not known? <\/i>\u2014Art thou ignorant, wilt thou not consider; <i>that the everlasting God <\/i>\u2014Who had no beginning of days, and will have no end of life; who was from eternity, and will be to eternity, and with whom therefore there is no deficiency, no decay; <i>the Lord <\/i>\u2014Hebrew, JEHOVAH, the self-existent Being; <i>the Creator of the ends of the earth <\/i>\u2014That is, of the whole earth, to its utmost bounds, and of all that is in it; <i>fainteth not, neither is weary <\/i>\u2014With the care of his church, or of the world? He is not by age or labour become weak and unable to help his people, as men are wont to be; nor is the care of them any burden to him. <i>There is no searching of his understanding <\/i>\u2014His providence comprehends all things, and nothing is exempted from it: and the counsels by which he governs all the world, and, in an especial manner, the affairs of his people, are far above the reach of any human understanding; and therefore we act ignorantly and foolishly if we pass a rash judgment upon the ways of the infinitely wise God. <\/p> ",
