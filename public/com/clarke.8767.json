An example has already been given of it in the note to <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NjYwXQ==\">Isaiah 49:23<\/a>. I will here add one or two more. \"Joshua called for all the men of Israel; and said unto the captains of the men of war that went with him, Come near, put your feet upon the necks of these kings,\" <a class=\"ref\">Joshua 10:24<\/a>. \"Adonibezek said, Threescore and ten kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered their meat under my table: As I have done, so hath God requited me,\" <a class=\"ref\">Judges 1:7<\/a>. The Emperor Valerianus, being through treachery taken prisoner by Sapor king of Persia, was treated by him as the basest and most abject slave: for the Persian monarch commanded the unhappy Roman to bow himself down, and offer him his back, on which he set his foot, in order to mount his chariot or horse whenever he had occasion. - Lactantius, De Mort.
