From the time he institutes his reign of peace on the earth, an endless stream of pilgrimages of the nations flows to Jehovah&rsquo;s temple to honor him: &ldquo;Your gates shall always remain open; they shall not be shut day or night, that a host of nations may be brought to you and their kings escorted in&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODMzXQ==\">Isaiah 60:11<\/a>); &ldquo;These I will bring to my holy mountain and gladden in my house of prayer. Their offerings and sacrifices shall be accepted on my altar, for my house shall be known as a house of prayer for all nations&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzYxXQ==\">Isaiah 56:7<\/a>);<\/p><p>&ldquo;In the latter days the mountain of Jehovah&rsquo;s house shall become established as the head of the mountains; it shall be preeminent among the hills, and all nations will flow to it. Many peoples shall go, saying, &lsquo;Come, let us go up to the mountain of Jehovah, to the house of the God of Jacob, that he may instruct us in his ways, that we may follow in his paths.&rsquo; For out of Zion shall go forth the law, and from Jerusalem the word of Jehovah. He will judge between the nations and arbitrate for many peoples. They will beat their swords into plowshares, their spears into pruning hooks&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzY4OCI6M30=\">Isaiah 2:2-4<\/a>).<\/p> ",
