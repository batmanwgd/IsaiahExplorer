But at the same time he supports himself with the hope, that he should obtain a glorious and abundant fruit of his divine mission in the world; for that <i>his judgment, <\/i> or <i>right, was with God, <\/i> and the reward of his work laid up with him; who would take good care, according to his wisdom and justice, that the proper and full <i>recompense <\/i> of his labour should be paid him.\u201d According to this just exposition of the passage, the latter clause of the verse agrees with the former, and the sense of both is briefly this: Though I see little or no fruit of my labour among the Jews, and meet with nothing but contempt, and reproach, and ill usage from them; yet God sees my fidelity and diligence in my work, and he will give judgment for me, and amply reward me in due time. <\/p> ",
