He alludes to agreements among men, in which it is customary to fix the time agreed on, which the parties are not at liberty to transgress. This is especially the case in the labors of <i>hirelings <\/i>,, from whom Scripture frequently draws a comparison in this respect, that they earnestly long for the appointed day when they shall receive their reward; for they groan, as it were, under the burden, and grievously dislike their daily toils. (<a class=\"ref\">Job 7:1 <\/a>.) In this way the Lord says, that he fixes a day for the Moabites, in which they shall not escape from the entire destruction of their power. <\/p>,\n <p> <i>With all his multitude. <\/i>,He expressly mentions a <i>multitude <\/i>,, because their number was great, and because they boasted of it, and thought that they were invincible. When he adds, that <i>the remnant shall be feeble, <\/i>,he means that there will be so great a change, that they will have no resemblance to their former condition; for nothing will be left but a sad and shocking sight. <\/p>,\n\n <p>End Of Volume First. <\/p>,",
