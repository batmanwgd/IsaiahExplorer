The sum of all these expressions is, to describe both the cause and effect together; the cause was <i>righteousness<\/i>, and <i>zeal<\/i>, in God; the effect, <i>salvation<\/i>, to his people, <i>and vengeance<\/i>, on his enemies. <i>According to their deeds <\/i>\u2014Hebrew, <span class=\"hebrew_text\">,\u05d2\u05de\u05dc\u05d5\u05ea<\/span>, <i>recompenses,<\/i>, or <i>deserts.<\/i>, That is, he will recompense his adversaries with those effects of his fury that they have deserved. <i>To the islands he will repay recompense <\/i>\u2014He will execute judgment on his enemies to the most remote parts of the earth. <\/p>",
