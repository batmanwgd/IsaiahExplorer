Jehovah has done extraordinary things for us, including abolishing death and wickedness and promising eternal life for the faithful. We recall that Jesus is called \"Wonderful Counsellor\" in 9:6. The Psalmist praised the Lord: \"Thou art the God that doest wonders: thou hast declared thy strength among the people. Thou hast with thine arm redeemed thy people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph\" (<a class=\"ref\">Ps. 77:14-15<\/a>). <\/p> <p><i>counsels of old. Counsels<\/i> (Hebrew <i>ya'ats<\/i>) speaks both of the plans that were made and of the determination to follow through with the plans (23:8-9). The words <i>of old<\/i> hark back to the premortal existence, when great ones made plans for the earth and her inhabitants.<\/p> ",
