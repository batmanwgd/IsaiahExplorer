    "html": "<p>After his people have suffered at the hands of tyrants local and foreign&mdash;to try their faith and to expiate their iniquities ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODQyMiI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 40:1-2<\/a>)&mdash;Jehovah takes vengeance on their enemies: &ldquo;Hear this, O wretched one, drunk, though not with wine. Thus says Jehovah, your Lord and God, who defends the cause of his people: &lsquo;I am taking the cup of stupor from your hand; you shall drink no more from the bowl of my wrath. And I give it into the hand of your tormentors&rsquo;&rdquo; ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODY5NiI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 51:22-23<\/a>). The Valiant One of Jacob demonstrates his valor in the eyes of &ldquo;all flesh&rdquo; when he redeems his elect from their oppressors.<\/p> ",
