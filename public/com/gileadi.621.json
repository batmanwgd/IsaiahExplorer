    "html": " <p>In the millennial age of peace, promised lands&mdash;a second chief covenant blessing&mdash;consist not only of the ones Jehovah promised Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob but also others of his people who lived as righteously as they did. As all promised lands are covenant blessings, and as Jehovah gave Abraham the land stretching from the Euphrates to the Nile (<a class=\"ref\">Genesis 15:18 <\/a>), additional promised lands follow the same pattern. When blessing his son Joseph, Jacob could thus declare, &ldquo;The blessings of your father have exceeded the blessings of my progenitors to the utmost bounds of the primeval hills&rdquo; (<a class=\"ref\">Genesis 49:26 <\/a>). <\/p> <p>Although the Zion\/Jerusalem category of Jehovah&rsquo;s people inherits promised lands conditionally, as Israel did anciently&mdash;conditional on keeping the terms of the Sinai covenant&mdash;the son\/servant category and levels higher inherit promised lands unconditionally. The Woman Zion, whom Jehovah marries, inherits the <em>place <\/em> Zion to which she returns (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODMzMSwxODY4NV0seyIxODgzMCI6Mn1d\">Isaiah 35:10; 51:11; 60:8-9 <\/a>), where Jehovah protects her in his Day of Judgment (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc3MzkiOjJ9LFsxNzk2MSwxODYwMF1d\">Isaiah 4:5-6; 14:32; 46:13 <\/a>) and where he comes to reign (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzA1LDE4ODIxLDE4ODY2XQ==\">Isaiah 52:8; 59:20; 62:11 <\/a>). From there, however, she spreads abroad and inherits the lands of her oppressors. <\/p> ",
