    "html": " <i>Cyrus\/shepherd. <\/i>This is the first time Cyrus is mentioned by name in Isaiah's prophecy. He is called <i>my shepherd,<\/i> a common title of kings (Ezek. 34). Shepherd is one of the names of Christ, who is the King of Israel (43:15) and of whom Cyrus was a type.<\/p> <p>Cyrus was the king who freed the people of Israel from political bondage and provided a way for them to return to their homeland. Christ is the King who frees all people from the bondage of death\u2014and the repentant from spiritual death\u2014and provides a way for us to return to our original home in God's presence. This temporal appointment was given to Cyrus, as it was to Peter, \"according to the foreknowledge of God the Father\" (<a class=\"ref\">1 Pet. 1:2<\/a>). This prophecy concerning Cyrus was given by Isaiah approximately two hundred years before Cyrus ruled Babylon.<\/p> <p> <i>shall perform all my pleasure. <\/i>Cyrus will do all the Lord asks of him; specifically, he will allow both Jerusalem and the temple to be rebuilt.<\/p> <p><i>saying to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be built. <\/i>See commentary on 44:26.<\/p> <p><i>saying&hellip;to the temple, Thy foundation shall be laid. <\/i>All that the Lord promised concerning Cyrus was accomplished, including the rebuilding of Jerusalem and the establishment of the temple (46:10; 2 Chr. 36:23; <a class=\"ref\">Ezra 1:1-2<\/a>). The rebuilding of the temple by Jews who returned to their homeland in Cyrus' day anticipates a future time when the temple will again be built in Jerusalem.<\/p> ",
