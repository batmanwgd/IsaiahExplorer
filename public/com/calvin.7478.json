    "html": "<p><i> Then Hezekiah prayed to God, saying, O Jehovah of hosts.<\/i> Because Sennacherib was the agent employed by Satan to shake the faith of Hezekiah, he defends himself by this rampart, that God possesses infinite power; for, by bestowing on God those lofty praises, he undoubtedly encourages himself to confidence in supplication. That out\u2019 prayers may not be unsuccessful, we ought always to hold it as certain that God \u201cis the rewarder of all who seek him.\u201d (<a class=\"ref\">Hebrews 11:6<\/a> .) It was especially necessary for the pious king, that he might boldly and undauntedly remove the obstruction by which Satan had attempted to stop the progress of his confidence, to believe that although wicked men mock and undervalue the power of God, still it remains undiminished. The heroic, courage of the pious king appeared by not only contending with a wicked king in maintaining the power of God, but. by exalting it in his own heart and appealing to God as the witness of his inward feelings. Accordingly, before forming any prayer, he overturns the delusions by which Satan had endeavored to shake his courage.<\/p> ",
