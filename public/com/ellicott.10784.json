    "html": "<p>The captain of fifty, and the honourable man.\u2014The first title implies a division like that of <a class=\"ref\">Exodus 18:21<\/a>, of which \u201cfifty\u201d was all but the minimum unit. So we have the three \u201ccaptains of fifty\u201d in <a class=\"ref\">2 Kings 1:9-15<\/a>. The \u201chonourable man\u201d (literally, eminent in countenance) would seem to occupy a position in the civil service of the State analogous to that of the \u201ccaptain of fifty\u201d in the military. <\/p>\n <p>The counsellor, and the cunning artificer.\u2014From the modern stand-point the two classes seem at opposite extremes of the social order. The latter, however (literally, masters in arts), would seem to have occupied a higher position in the East, like that of military or civil engineers or artists with us. So in <a class=\"ref\">2 Kings 24:14, Jeremiah 24:1<\/a>, the \u201ccraftsmen and the smiths\u201d are grouped with the \u201cmen of might\u201d who were carried to Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar, and contrasted with the poor who were left behind. The military works of Uzziah had doubtless given a prominence to the \u201ccunning men\u201d who were employed on them (<a class=\"ref\">2 Chronicles 26:15<\/a>). By some critics, however, the word is taken as equal to \u201cmagician.\u201d <\/p>\n <p>The eloquent orator.\u2014Literally, skilled in speech. The Authorised Version suggests the idea of the power of such skill in controlling the debates of popular assemblies. Here, however, the thought is rather that of one who says the right words at the right time; or possibly the enchanter who has his formul\u00e6 (the word implies the whisper of incantations, as in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODI3XQ==\">Isaiah 8:19<\/a>) ready at command for all occasions. <\/p>",
