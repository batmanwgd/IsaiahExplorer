And the consequence of it, the trouble and desperation of those that remained from this slaughter, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTc3NzA=\">Isaiah 5:30<\/a>. See Vitringa. <i>Their root shall be as rottenness <\/i>\u2014 They shall be like a tree, which not only withers in its branches, but dies and rots at the roots, and therefore is past all hopes of recovery. That is, they shall be destroyed, both root and branch, and that as certainly and irresistibly as fire devours the stubble on which it kindles, and the flame consumes the chaff which it touches. <i>Their blossom shall go up as dust <\/i>\u2014 Shall vanish as the dust, which is blown away with every wind, or shall be resolved into dust, and yield no fruit; <i>because they have cast away the law of the Lord, <\/i>&c. \u2014 Have cast off all obedience to it, and treated it with contempt.<\/p>",
