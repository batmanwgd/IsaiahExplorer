    "html": " <i>highway. <\/i>This word may also be read \"exalted path\" (or \"way that is high\"\u2014highway). This highway, called \"the way of holiness\" (11:16; 35:8), is our path to God. It brings us out of bondage and into the promised land. It leads us through the gates of baptism and to the temple, or the presence of God (<a class=\"ref\">Jer. 31:21<\/a>; see also <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODY4NCI6Mn0=\">Isa. 51:10-11<\/a>). That the way is a \"way of holiness\" for the \"redeemed\" but not for the \"unclean\" emphasizes the connection with temples and temple ordinances.<\/p> <p><i>unclean shall not pass over. <\/i>Those who have chosen not to avail themselves of the Lord's atonement and enter into covenants with him will not pass over the way of holiness.<\/p> <p><i>wayfaring men. <\/i>The traveler on this particular highway is the searcher for truth. The sincere disciple of truth eventually finds the path of the Lord, and, though many account such to be a fool for his conversion to the gospel of the Lord, he will not err by walking this highway. <\/p> ",
