    "html": " <p> Isaiah illustrates the foolishness of those who worship false gods. Such are extremely vain, and one day they will be ashamed for their abominations. Those who cut down a tree and use one piece of the wood for cooking and another piece to fashion a god \"have not known nor understood:&hellip;they cannot see&hellip;they cannot understand\" (44:18). They will not find salvation (44:20).<\/p> <p>Although Isaiah speaks specifically of idols made from wood, he refers to false gods of any type, including money, worldly possessions, and power.<\/p> <blockquote> They that make a <i>graven image<\/i> are all of them <u>vanity<\/u>;     <br>and [<i>the things in which they delight<\/i>] <u>shall not profit<\/u>;     <br>and they are their own witnesses;     <br>they see not, nor know; that they may be ashamed. (44:9)     <br>Who hath <i>formed<\/i> a <u>god<\/u>,     <br>or <i>molten<\/i> a <u>graven image<\/u>     <br>that is profitable for nothing? (44:10)     <br>Behold, all his fellows shall be ashamed:     <br>and the workmen, they are of men:     <br><i>let them<\/i> all <u>be gathered<\/u> together,     <br><i>let them<\/i> <u>stand up<\/u>;     <br>yet <i>they<\/i> <u>shall fear<\/u>,     <br>and <i>they<\/i> <u>shall be ashamed<\/u> together. (44:11)     <br>The smith with the tongs both <i>worketh<\/i> in <u>the coals<\/u>,     <br>and <i>fashioneth<\/i> it with <u>hammers<\/u>,     <br>and <i>worketh<\/i> it with the <u>strength of his arms<\/u>:     <br>yea, he is <i>hungry,<\/i> and his <u>strength faileth<\/u>:     <br>he <i>drinketh no water,<\/i> and is <u>faint<\/u>. (44:12)     <br>The <i>carpenter<\/i> <u>stretcheth<\/u> out his rule;     <br><i>he<\/i> <u>marketh<\/u> it out with a line;     <br><i>he<\/i> <u>fitteth<\/u> it with planes,     <br>and <i>he<\/i> <u>marketh<\/u> it out with the compass,     <br>and <u>maketh<\/u> it after the figure of a man,     <br>according to the beauty of a man;     <br>that it may remain in the house. (44:13)     <br>He <i>heweth him<\/i> down <u>cedars<\/u>,     <br>and <i>taketh<\/i> the <u>cypress and the oak<\/u>,     <br>which he <i>strengtheneth<\/i> for himself among the <u>trees of the forest<\/u>:     <br>he <i>planteth<\/i> an <u>ash<\/u>,     <br>and the rain doth nourish it. (44:14)     <br>Then shall it be for a man to <i>burn:<\/i> for he will take thereof, and <u>warm himself<\/u>;     <br>yea, he <i>kindleth it,<\/i> and <u>baketh bread<\/u>;     <br>yea, he maketh a <i>god,<\/i> and <u>worshippeth<\/u> it;     <br>he maketh it a <i>graven image,<\/i> and <u>falleth down thereto<\/u>. (44:15)     <br>He burneth part thereof in the fire; with part thereof he eateth flesh;     <br>he <i>roasteth roast,<\/i> and is <u>satisfied<\/u>:     <br>yea, he <i>warmeth himself,<\/i> and saith, <u>Aha, I am warm<\/u>, I have seen the fire: (44:16)     <br>And the residue thereof he <i>maketh<\/i> <u>a god<\/u>, even his graven image:     <br>he <i>falleth down<\/i> unto <u>it<\/u>,     <br>and <i>worshippeth<\/i> <u>it<\/u>,     <br>and <i>prayeth<\/i> unto <u>it<\/u>,     <br>and saith, <i>Deliver me;<\/i> for <u>thou art my god<\/u>. (44:17)     <br>They have not known nor understood: for [they have] shut<i> their eyes,<\/i> that they <u>cannot see<\/u>;     <br>and <i>their hearts,<\/i> that they <u>cannot understand<\/u>. (44:18)     <br>And none considereth in his heart,     <br>neither is there knowledge nor understanding to say,     <br>I have <i>burned<\/i> <u>part<\/u> of it in the fire;     <br>yea, also I have <i>baked<\/i> <u>bread<\/u> upon the coals thereof;     <br>I have <i>roasted<\/i> <u>flesh<\/u>, and eaten it:     <br>and shall I <i>make<\/i> the residue thereof an <u>abomination<\/u>?     <br>shall I <i>fall down<\/i> to the <u>stock of a tree<\/u>? (44:19)     <br>He feedeth on ashes:     <br>a deceived heart hath turned him aside, that he cannot deliver his soul,     <br>nor say, Is there not a lie in my right hand? (44:20)<\/blockquote> ",
