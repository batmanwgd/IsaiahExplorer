His reference to their eating their own dung and drinking their own urine alludes to Assyria&rsquo;s plan to lay siege to the city if its occupants don&rsquo;t surrender. Starving them out would present an easy victory. King Hezekiah, however, has his own plan of dealing with the alien threat. He knows that&mdash;according to the terms of the Davidic Covenant&mdash;so long as he keeps Jehovah&rsquo;s law and the people keep Hezekiah&rsquo;s law, Jehovah is bound by the terms of his covenant to protect them. <\/p> ",
