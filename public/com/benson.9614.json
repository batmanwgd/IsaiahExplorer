In other words, you Jews shall recover your ancient strength and glory, and be renewed in as wonderful a manner as if dry, withered bones should recover their youth and moisture: or, as if the dead bones in a charnel-house should be united with sinews, clothed again with flesh and skin, and should have life and vigour infused into them. Then shall be effected that resurrection of the dry bones spoken of by <a class=\"ref\">Ezekiel 37:1<\/a>, &c., for that vision relates to the restoration of the Jewish nation, after it had lain for many ages in a dead, hopeless condition. In like manner St. Paul calls the receiving of the Jews into the church, <i>life from the dead, <\/i><a class=\"ref\">Romans 11:15<\/a>. <i>And the hand of the Lord shall be known toward his servants <\/i>\u2014 The power, protection, and influence of God shall be made manifest for, and upon, all such as truly serve and obey him. <i>And his indignation toward his enemies <\/i>\u2014 But the wicked shall experience a quite contrary dispensation, <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 1:4<\/a>. As God\u2019s hand shall be upon and toward such as fear him, to cover, bless, and influence them, so his indignation shall in that day be showed toward those of your nation who have manifested themselves to be his enemies.<\/p>",
