In the same way that these existed in ancient times and led to God&rsquo;s intervening to destroy the wicked from the earth (<a class=\"ref\">Genesis 6:5-7; 18:20; 19:24-25<\/a>), so they lead to his end-time destruction of the wicked (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxNzg3NF0seyIxNzkxMSI6MTZ9LFsxODAzOCwxODA0NSwxODE4N10seyIxODczMyI6Mn1d\">Isaiah 10:23; 13:4-19; 21:2, 9; 28:22; 54:9-10<\/a>). Because what goes around comes around, when Jehovah reverses his people&rsquo;s circumstances &ldquo;they with their practices and ideas shall be made an end of&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4OTQwXQ==\">Isaiah 66:17<\/a>). <\/p> ",
