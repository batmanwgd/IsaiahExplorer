They were carried away on the backs of beasts and could not prevent it; they were equally powerless to help the people who worshiped them. So also are our material accumulations and our temporal pursuits unable to help us in times of need.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>In contrast, the Lord not only has power to help but he carries us through our times of trial. He will support us from beginning to end. Even time and space are no obstacles to him. Whatever he decides to do, he will accomplish.<\/i><\/p> ",
