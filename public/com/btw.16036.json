But the Lord has a purpose in turning up the heat. When I read about the refiner's fire, I'm always reminded of the words of the hymn \"How Firm a Foundation\": \"The flame shall not hurt thee; I only design, thy dross to consume and thy gold to refine\" (<i>Hymns,<\/i> no. 85). Note how Isaiah's metaphor introduced back in verse 4 still applies\u2014those whose necks are <i>iron<\/i> and whose brows are <i>brass<\/i> need to be melted down and made pliable in the furnace of affliction. Ouch!  <\/p>  <p>  <b>1 Nephi 20:11. \"I will not suffer my name to be polluted\"<\/b> How could we pollute the Lord's name? Perhaps by using it in vain, or by calling ourselves by His name without really relying on Him (as in verses 1\u20132). Also, note that the Lord told Abraham, \"I will take thee, to put upon thee my name, <i>even the Priesthood of thy father,<\/i> and my power shall be over thee\"(Abraham 1:18; <i>emphasis<\/i> added), which indicates that the Lord's \"name\" could refer to the Lord's power or to the priesthood.  <\/p>  ",
