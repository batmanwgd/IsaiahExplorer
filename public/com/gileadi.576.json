    "html": "<p>Jehovah&rsquo;s raising his <em>hand<\/em> and <em>ensign<\/em>&mdash;his end-time servant&mdash;brings about his people&rsquo;s return from exile: &ldquo;In that day the sprig of Jesse, who stands for an <em>ensign<\/em> to the peoples, shall be sought by the nations, and his rest shall be glorious. In that day my Lord will again raise his <em>hand<\/em> to reclaim the remnant of his people&mdash;those who shall be left out of Assyria, Egypt, Pathros, Cush, Elam, Shinar, Hamath, and the islands of the sea. He will raise the <em>ensign<\/em> to the nations and assemble the exiled of Israel; he will gather the scattered of Judah from the four directions of the earth&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzg5NSI6M30=\">Isaiah 11:10-12<\/a>; emphasis added).<\/p><p>The kings and queens of the &ldquo;nations&rdquo; or &ldquo;Gentiles&rdquo; (<em>goyim<\/em>) escort Jehovah&rsquo;s &ldquo;sons&rdquo; and &ldquo;daughters&rdquo;&mdash;his elect who ascend to the son\/servant category&mdash;in a new exodus out of all nations when Jehovah empowers his servant (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc5MDAiOjJ9LHsiMTg2MzUiOjJ9LHsiMTg2ODMiOjN9LHsiMTg3MDgiOjV9LHsiMTg3NDQiOjN9LFsxODc1M11d\">Isaiah 11:15-16; 48:20-21; 51:9-11; 52:11-15; 55:3-5, 12<\/a>). Having attained the seraph category, these spiritual kings and queens exercise power over enemies and obstacles in the pattern of Moses and Elijah, enabling Jehovah&rsquo;s people to walk through deserts, mountains, seas, rivers, and fire in the new exodus to Zion (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODY0OCwxNzkwMF0seyIxODMyNyI6NX0seyIxODQ2MiI6NH0seyIxODQ2OSI6Mn0sWzE4NTA4LDE4Njg0XV0=\">v 11; Isaiah 11:15; 35:6-10; 41:10-13, 17-18; 43:2; 51:10<\/a>).<\/p><p>A disparity exists between these same spiritual kings and queens of the Gentiles and other Gentiles who, instead of repenting, oppose Jehovah&rsquo;s people (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgyMDEiOjJ9LHsiMTg3MzkiOjN9LFsxODkyOF1d\">Isaiah 29:7-8; 54:15-17; 66:5<\/a>). While the Gentiles&rsquo; kings and queens fulfill their roles of proxy saviors under the terms of the Davidic Covenant on the seraph level, those Gentiles who turn into Jehovah&rsquo;s enemies end up bowing down before his people and licking the dust of their feet (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NTc2LDE4ODM2LDE4OTI4XQ==\">Isaiah 45:14; 60:14; 66:5<\/a>). Those who &ldquo;know&rdquo; Jehovah in the end are those who &ldquo;hope in&rdquo; or &ldquo;wait for&rdquo; (<em>qiwweh<\/em>) him through a time of adversity (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MDI2LDE4MTI4LDE4NzAzXQ==\">Isaiah 19:21; 25:9; 52:6<\/a>).<\/p>",
