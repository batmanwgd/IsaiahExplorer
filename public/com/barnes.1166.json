Of Eliakim we know nothing more than what is stated here, and in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 36 <\/a>. From that account it appears that he was prefect of the palace; that he was employed in a negotiation with the leader of the army of the Assyrians; and that he was in all things faithful to the trust reposed in him. <\/p> <p> <em>The son of Hilkiah <\/em>&mdash;Kimchi supposes that this was the same as Azariah the son of Hilkiah, who might have had two names, and who was a ruler over the house of God in the time of Hezekiah <a class=\"ref\">1 Chronicles 6:13 <\/a>. <\/p> ",
