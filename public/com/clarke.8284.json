    "html": " <p>Judgments of God upon Damascus, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzk4NSI6M30=\">Isaiah 17:1-3<\/a>; and upon Israel, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzk4OCI6M30=\">Isaiah 17:4-6<\/a>. Good effects of these judgments on the small remnant or gleaning that should escape them, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3OTkxXQ==\">Isaiah 17:7<\/a>, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3OTkyXQ==\">Isaiah 17:8<\/a>. The same judgments represented in other but stronger terms, and imputed to irreligion and neglect of God, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzk5MyI6M30=\">Isaiah 17:9-11<\/a>. The remaining verses are a distinct prophecy, a beautiful detached piece, worked up with the greatest elegance, sublimity, and propriety; and forming a noble description of the formidable invasion and sudden overthrow of Sennacherib, exactly suitable to the event, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzk5NiI6M30=\">Isaiah 17:12-14<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n <p>This prophecy by its title should relate only to Damascus; but it full as much concerns, and more largely treats of, the kingdom of Samaria and the Israelites, confederated with Damascus and the Syrians against the kingdom of Judah. It was delivered probably soon after the prophecies of the seventh and eighth chapters, in the beginning of the reign of Ahaz; and was fulfilled by Tiglath-pileser's taking Damascus, and carrying the people captives to Kir, (<a class=\"ref\">2 Kings 16:9<\/a>;), and overrunning great part of the kingdom of Israel, and carrying a great number of the Israelites also captives to Assyria; and still more fully in regard to Israel, by the conquest of the kingdom, and the captivity of the people, effected a few years after by Shalmaneser. - L. <\/p>",
