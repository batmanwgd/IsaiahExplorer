    "html": "<p> The reason why the tent is to be so large and strong is given in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzI3XQ==\">Isaiah 54:3<\/a> : <em> \u201cFor thou wilt break forth on the right and on the left; and thy seed will take possession of nations, and they will people desolate cities.\u201d<\/em> \u201cOn the right and on the left\u201d is equivalent to \u201con the south and north\u201d (<a class=\"ref\">Psalms 89:13<\/a>, the speaker being supposed to have his face turned towards the east: compare the Sanscrit <em> apa\u0302n <\/em> , situated at the back, i.e., towards the west). We must supply both west and east, since the promises contained in such passages as <a class=\"ref\">Genesis 15:18-21<\/a> remained unfulfilled even in the age of David and Solomon. Jerusalem will now spread out, and break through all her former bounds (<em> pa\u0302rats <\/em> is used in the same sense in <a class=\"ref\">Genesis 28:14<\/a>); and her seed (i.e., the seed acquired by the Servant of Jehovah, the dead yet eternally living One, the \u03c3\u03c0\u03b5\u0301\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1 , whose \u03c3\u03c0\u03b5\u0301\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1 He Himself is) will take possession of nations (<em> ya\u0302rash <\/em> , <em> ya\u0302re\u0304sh <\/em> , <em> capessere <\/em> , <em> occupare <\/em> ; more especially \u03ba\u03bb\u03b7\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03b5\u03b9\u0342\u03bd , syn. <em> na\u0302chal <\/em> ); and they (i.e., the children born to her) will people desolate cities (<em> ho\u0304sh\u0131\u0304bh <\/em> , the causative of <em> ya\u0302shabh <\/em> , to be inhabited, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3OTQ5XQ==\">Isaiah 14:20<\/a>). Thus will the promise be fulfilled, that \u201cthe meek shall inherit the earth,\u201d - a promise not confined to the Preacher on the mount, but found also in <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 37:9-11<\/a>, and uttered by our own prophet in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODQzLDE4OTA3XQ==\">Isaiah 60:21; Isaiah 65:9<\/a>.<\/p>",
