He appoints his servant&mdash;his <em>arm <\/em> of <em>righteousness <\/em>&mdash;to restore justice in the earth (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODQ4MiI6NH0=\">Isaiah 42:1-4<\/a>), to deliver the righteous (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODY4MyI6M30=\">Isaiah 51:9-11<\/a>), to put down the wicked (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDU0XQ==\">Isaiah 41:2<\/a>), and to prepare the way for <em>salvation <\/em>&mdash;their Savior (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODY2XQ==\">Isaiah 62:11<\/a>).
