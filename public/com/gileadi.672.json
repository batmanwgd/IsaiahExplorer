    "html": "<p>Jehovah&rsquo;s righteous warrior aspect grows prominent in his Day of Judgment: &ldquo;Jehovah will come forth like a warrior, his passions aroused like a fighter; he will give the war cry, raise the shout of victory over his enemies&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDk0XQ==\">Isaiah 42:13<\/a>); &ldquo;When my sword drinks its fill in the heavens, it shall come down on Edom in judgment, on the people I have sentenced to damnation.... It is Jehovah&rsquo;s day of vengeance, the year of retribution on behalf of Zion&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MzA5LDE4MzEyXQ==\">Isaiah 34:5, 8<\/a>); &ldquo;For with fire and with his sword shall Jehovah execute judgment on all flesh, and those slain by Jehovah shall be many&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4OTM5XQ==\">Isaiah 66:16<\/a>).<\/p><p>Executing Jehovah&rsquo;s judgment upon a wicked world are (1) the king of Assyria\/Babylon, who personifies Jehovah&rsquo;s<em>vengeance<\/em> ,<em>fury<\/em> ,<em>wrath<\/em> , and<em>reprisals<\/em> or retribution (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc4NTYiOjJ9LFsxODMwNl1d\">Isaiah 10:5-6; 34:2<\/a>); (2) Jehovah&rsquo;s servant, who personifies his<em>arm<\/em> of<em>righteousness<\/em> (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg4MTciOjJ9LFsxODQ1NCwxODY4M11d\">vv 16-17; Isaiah 41:2; 51:9<\/a>); and (3) Jehovah himself, who personifies his people&rsquo;s<em>salvation<\/em> (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg4MTciOjJ9LFsxNzkwMywxODg2Nl1d\">vv 16-17; Isaiah 12:2; 62:11<\/a>). Jehovah&rsquo;s Day of Judgment thus portends his coming in person when the earth has been cleansed of wickedness: &ldquo;See, your God is coming to avenge and to reward; God himself will come and deliver you&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MzI1XQ==\">Isaiah 35:4<\/a> ; cf.<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODIxXQ==\">v 20<\/a>).<\/p> ",
