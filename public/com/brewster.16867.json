The Light of Christ will shine in the earth and in the world of departed spirits. He shall take His rightful place upon David's throne.<\/p>     <p>In verses 8 through 21, the prophet speaks of the past and future judgments that are to come upon Israel and Judah. \"In all fairness it should be pointed out that it is difficult to tell whether these verses are completely a prediction of future events or a review of past events,\" wrote Sidney B. Sperry. \"Some authorities think they refer only to Israel (the Northern Kingdom). Personally,\" continued Dr. Sperry, \"I shall take a middle course among the various views that have been presented over the years. The main thing for us to remember is that the prophet is giving a warning of disaster to all Israel whether it be illustrated by past events or whether by the prediction of future events.\" (BMC, 208.)<\/p>",
