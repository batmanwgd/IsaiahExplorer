    "html": " <p>In these verses, as Isaiah promised the eventual restoration and regathering of Israel, he compared it to a person&rsquo;s walking on a perilous journey where fire and flood threaten. The metaphor is as valid for an individual as it is for the house of Israel. The Lord called her by name, for <em>Israel <\/em> is the name given her by covenant and symbolizes the fact that she would eventually be preserved and belong to Him (see <a class=\"ref\">Genesis 32:28&ndash;30<\/a>). He then promised that as she passed through the perils of her journey back He would be with her. Neither waters nor flood nor the fires of trial and persecution could take away His protection of His chosen people. There may also be a spiritual symbolism in these promises. When Israel escaped from Egypt, she passed through the water (the Red Sea) and was overshadowed with fire, the pillar of fire, and smoke (see <a class=\"ref\">Exodus 13:21&ndash;22; 14:21&ndash;22<\/a>). Paul saw these phenomena as types or symbols of the baptism of water and the Holy Ghost (see <a class=\"ref\">1 Corinthians 10:1&ndash;4<\/a>). Here Isaiah showed Israel being gathered. One is gathered into the fold by becoming baptized; thus, the symbolism is both spiritually and temporally significant. <\/p> <p class=\"cite\"> LDS Church Educational System Old Testament Student Manual, 1 Kings&ndash;Malachi, Religion 302, Chapter 16, Item 23 <\/p> ",
