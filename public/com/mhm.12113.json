Here is,  I. The consternation that Ahaz was in upon an attempt of the  confederate forces of Syria and Israel against Jerusalem,   <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3Nzg0XQ==\">Isaiah 7:1<\/a>.  II. The assurance which God, by the prophet, sent him for his  encouragement, that the attempt should be defeated and Jerusalem should  be preserved,   <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzc4NiI6N30=\">Isaiah 7:3-9<\/a>.  III. The confirmation of this by a sign which God gave to Ahaz, when he  refused to ask one, referring to Christ, and our redemption by him,   <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzc5MyI6N30=\">Isaiah 7:10-16<\/a>.  IV. A threatening of the great desolation that God would bring upon  Ahaz and his kingdom by the Assyrians, notwithstanding their escape  from this present storm, because they went on still in their wickedness,   <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzgwMCI6OX0=\">Isaiah 7:17-25<\/a>.  And this is written both for our comfort and for our admonition.<\/p>",
