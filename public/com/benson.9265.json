The prophet may here refer to different sieges of Jerusalem, that of Sennacherib, that of the Chaldeans, or even to that of the Romans. <i>Thou shalt be brought down \u2014 thy speech shall be low <\/i>\u2014 Thou, who now speakest so loftily, shalt be humbled, and in a submissive manner, and with a low voice, shalt beg the favour of thine enemies. <i>As of one that hath a familiar spirit, out of the ground <\/i>\u2014 \u201cThat the souls of the dead uttered a feeble, stridulous sound, very different from the natural human voice, was a popular notion among the heathen, as well as among the Jews. This appears from several passages of their poets, Homer, Virgil, Horace. The pretenders to the art of necromancy, who were chiefly women, had an art of speaking with a reigned voice, so as to deceive those who applied to them, by making them believe that it was the voice of the ghost.

From these arts of the necromancers, the popular notion seems to have arisen that the ghost\u2019s voice was a weak, stridulous, almost an inarticulate sort of sound, very different from the speech of the living.\u201d \u2014 Bishop Lowth.<\/p>",
