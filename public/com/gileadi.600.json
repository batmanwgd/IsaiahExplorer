    "html": " <p>The awakening and arising from the dust of Jehovah&rsquo;s people who pass his tests of their loyalty on the Zion\/Jerusalem level signifies their rebirth or re-creation on the son\/servant level. Identified as the Daughter of Zion (the Woman Zion), they ascend to this elect level after experiencing a descent phase of personal trials. Comprising a &ldquo;holy city,&rdquo; these holy and valiant ones Jehovah protects by his direct intervention in his Day of Judgment (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc3MzciOjR9LFsxNzc4MywxNzkxMF0seyIxODMyOSI6M31d\">Isaiah 4:3-6; 6:13; 13:3; 35:8-10 <\/a>). They become the &ldquo;holy people&rdquo; to whom Jehovah comes after they have prepared the way before him (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg0MjIiOjV9LHsiMTg4NjUiOjN9XQ==\">Isaiah 40:1-5; 62:10-12 <\/a>). <\/p> <p>Like the term &ldquo;holy,&rdquo; the term &ldquo;power&rdquo; or &ldquo;strength&rdquo; (<em>&lsquo;oz <\/em>) forms a word link: &ldquo;Your faithfulness in time [of trial] shall prove to be a strength&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4Mjg2XQ==\">Isaiah 33:6 <\/a>). After they prove loyal to him by keeping the terms of the Davidic Covenant and become &ldquo;holy&rdquo; or sanctified, Jehovah empowers them when their enemies come against them. That empowerment occurs on the heels of his empowering his <em>arm <\/em>&mdash;his servant&mdash;to restore his people: &ldquo;Awake, arise; clothe yourself with power, O arm of Jehovah!&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NjgzXQ==\">Isaiah 51:9 <\/a>); &ldquo;For I won honor in the eyes of Jehovah when my God became my strength&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NjQyXQ==\">Isaiah 49:5 <\/a>). <\/p> <p>The rebirth and re-creation of Jehovah&rsquo;s people thus means that the servant&rsquo;s mission is succeeding. At the time the Woman Zion rises from the dust to sit on her throne, moreover, the Harlot Babylon descends from her throne into the dust (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NjAxXQ==\">Isaiah 47:1 <\/a>) as an integral part of their reversal of circumstances. Belonging to the Babylon category are the &ldquo;uncircumcised and defiled&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;sinners in Zion&rdquo; and other reprobates (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODI5NF0seyIxODgwMyI6M31d\">Isaiah 33:14; 59:2-4 <\/a>). These suffer the same fate as the Harlot Babylon (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc4NDMiOjd9LHsiMTgxNDEiOjJ9XQ==\">Isaiah 9:13-19; 26:10-11 <\/a>) whom Jehovah destroys as he did Sodom and Gomorrah (<a class=\"ref\">Genesis 19:24 <\/a>; <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3OTI2XQ==\">Isaiah 13:19 <\/a>). <\/p> <p>The Woman Zion&rsquo;s depiction as a &ldquo;holy city&rdquo; thus has a counterpart in an unholy city&mdash;also representing Jehovah&rsquo;s people&mdash;that was once a &ldquo;faithful city&rdquo; but that has turned into a &ldquo;harlot&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxNzY3Nl0seyIxODc3MyI6Nn1d\">Isaiah 1:21; 57:7-12 <\/a>). It is a &ldquo;city of revelry&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MDU1LDE4MjczXQ==\">Isaiah 22:2; 32:13 <\/a>) that Jehovah makes a heap of rubble (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTIxXQ==\">Isaiah 25:2 <\/a>); an elite or &ldquo;exalted city&rdquo; that he casts to the ground, lays even with the dust (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTM2XQ==\">Isaiah 26:5 <\/a>). As the character traits of the wicked city and Jehovah&rsquo;s alienated people typify a Babylon category&mdash;both exalting themselves over Jehovah&rsquo;s holy ones&mdash;both end up in the dust (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3Njk2LDE4MTk4LDE4NjAxXQ==\">Isaiah 2:10; 29:4; 47:1 <\/a>). <\/p> <p>The Woman Zion&rsquo;s awakening and arising from the dust, moreover, signifies resurrection at the time Jehovah abolishes death: &ldquo;Your dead shall live when their bodies arise. [You will say to them,] &lsquo;Awake, and sing for joy, you who abide in the dust: your dew is the dew of sunrise!&rsquo; For the earth shall cast up its dead&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTUwXQ==\">Isaiah 26:19 <\/a>; cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODEyNiI6Mn0=\">25:7-8 <\/a>). Resurrection from the dead thus takes place concurrently with Zion&rsquo;s rebirth. The robes of glory that replace the bands around her neck allude to Zion&rsquo;s release from captivity and her priestly endowment by Jehovah&rsquo;s servant (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg0ODciOjJ9LHsiMTg2NDUiOjJ9LFsxODY2Ml0seyIxODg0NSI6M30sWzE4ODU0XV0=\">Isaiah 42:6-7; 49:8-9, 25; 61:1-3, 10 <\/a>). <\/p> <p>Those who sell Jehovah&rsquo;s elect &ldquo;without price&rdquo; are their political and ecclesiastical leaders: (1) political, because those who govern them emulate their exemplar, the king of Assyria\/Babylon, in taking people captive (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODcwMl0seyIxNzg1NCI6NH0seyIxNzk0NSI6Mn0sWzE4NjYxXV0=\">v 5; Isaiah 10:3-6; 14:16-17; 49:24 <\/a>); and (2) ecclesiastical, because their priests and prophets deprive them of the truths of God that empower them against being led captive and that lead them to know Jehovah personally (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODcwMywxNzc1M10seyIxNzgyMiI6NH0sWzE4MTc4XV0=\">v 6; Isaiah 5:13; 8:14-17; 28:13 <\/a>). Accordingly, Jehovah in the end redeems his elect without price from their captive state (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODcwNl0seyIxODMyOSI6M30seyIxODcyOSI6NH0seyIxODg2NiI6Mn1d\">v 9; Isaiah 35:8-10; 54:5-8; 62:11-12 <\/a>). <\/p> ",
