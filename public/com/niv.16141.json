NOTED IN<\/small> the introduction, Isaiah 7\u201312 and 36\u201339 are \u201cbookends,\u201d dealing with the different ways in which two Judean kings, Ahaz and Hezekiah, approach the problem of trust in God in the face of serious military\/political threats to their kingdom. But what lies between in the intervening chapters? We might call them \u201cLessons in Trust.\u201d<\/p>         <p>\u2003It is as though the student has failed the examination in chapters 7\u201312. So before this student is allowed to take the examination again in chapter 36, some tutoring is necessary. The tutoring falls into three sessions: chapters 13\u2013 23; 24\u201327; and 28\u201333, with a wrap-up in 34\u201335. Here are some of the subjects covered in the tutoring sessions:<\/p>         <ul>             <li>Why trust the nations when they are under judgment from God (chs. 13\u201323)?<\/li>             <li>Why trust the nations when all of history is in our God\u2019s hands (chs. 24\u201327)?<\/li>             <li>Those who counsel you to trust flesh and blood instead of the Spirit of God are fools (chs. 28\u201335).<\/li>         <\/ul>         <p>Once these lessons have been presented, it will be time to take the test again, but this time, as the prophet has foretold, for much higher stakes: not merely for the survival of the Davidic dynasty but for the very survival of the nation.<\/p>         <p>\u2003The material in chapters 13\u201323 fits a category found in several of the prophets: oracles against the nations (see esp. Jer. 46\u201351; Ezek. 25\u201332, but note also Obadiah and Nahum, which are each composed of a single such oracle\u2014Obadiah against Edom and Nahum against Assyria). In general these oracles are God\u2019s way of saying that just because he chooses to use the pagan nations as his tool to judge disobedient Israel and Judah does not mean those nations are going to escape judgment for their sins. Israel will be restored after disciplinary punishment, but some of these nations are going to disappear from the face of the earth.<\/p>         <p>\u2003As I have already said, the oracles against the nations have been placed at this point in the book of Isaiah to emphasize the foolishness of trusting in the nations, something Ahaz has done and Hezekiah will be tempted to do. They may also be at this place to underline the certainty of the promises of restoration made in chapter 11. The nations will not be able to hold their captives because God will certainly judge them. The particular nations marked for judgment are Babylon (13:1\u201314:23; 21:1\u201310 [and Assyria, 14:24\u201327]), Philistia (14:28\u201332), Moab (15:1\u201316:14), Damascus (Syria, 17:1\u201314), Cush (Nubia and Ethiopia, 18:1\u20137), Egypt (19:1\u201320:6), Dumah (Edom? 21:11\u201312), Arabia (21:13\u201317), Jerusalem (Judah, 22:1\u201325), and Tyre (23:1\u201318). There is no obvious reason for this particular selection or this particular arrangement, although scholars have tried valiantly to find one. About the most one can say is that it is an inclusive list, covering the whole ancient Near Eastern world (omitting only Ammon), beginning with the great commercial power in the east, Babylon, and concluding with the great commercial power in the west, Tyre.<\/p>         ",
