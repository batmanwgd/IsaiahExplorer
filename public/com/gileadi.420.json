By so doing, he posits the idea of a black pharaoh functioning as the type of an end-time counterpart. As with other historical names and persons, all prefigure an end-time repetition of history. Tirhakah king of Cush (Pharaoh Taharqa, the third and last ruler of Egypt&rsquo;s 25th dynasty) was of Sudanese birth, not a native-born Egyptian.
