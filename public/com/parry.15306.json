    "html": " <i>Ye shall conceive chaff.<\/i> You (plural, referring to the wicked) will conceive (become pregnant with) chaff, or useless husks of grain. This harsh statement to the wicked tells them that their lives and plans will founder and are in vain.<\/p> <p> <i>ye shall bring forth stubble.<\/i> Your pregnancy has come to completion, and you (plural, referring to the wicked) will now bring forth stubble, rather than useful grains of wheat. In other words, the lives and evil designs of the wicked will be worthy only to be burned, as chaff and stubble are burned. This passage clearly refers to the judgment and great burning of the wicked that will occur at the Second Coming.<\/p> <p><i>your breath, as fire, shall devour you.<\/i> The Jerusalem Bible reads, \"my breath shall devour you like fire.\" This reading accords with Isaiah's earlier images of the Lord burning the wicked (see 30:27-28).<\/p> ",
