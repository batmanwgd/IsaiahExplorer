    "html": "<p>Before Jehovah delivers others of his people besides his elect, Assyria&mdash;a &ldquo;nation of incomprehensible speech and a strange tongue&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTgxNzY=\">Isaiah 28:11<\/a>)&mdash;slays and enslaves them (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 10:3-6<\/a>). The archtyrant resembles a babbling <em>tongue<\/em> that &ldquo;blasphemes&rdquo; against Jehovah (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 37:23-24<\/a>), that &ldquo;rises to accuse you&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTg3NDE=\">Isaiah 54:17<\/a>), that &ldquo;utters duplicity&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTg4MDQ=\">Isaiah 59:3<\/a>), and that demands of them a predatory taxation. Even prior to Assyria&rsquo;s invasion, however, his people&rsquo;s leaders followed the same evil archetype: &ldquo;My people are taken over without price; those who govern them act presumptuously&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTg3MDI=\">Isaiah 52:5<\/a>).<\/p>",
