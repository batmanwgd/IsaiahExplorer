The archtyrant resembles a babbling <em>tongue <\/em> that &ldquo;blasphemes&rdquo; against Jehovah (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODM3NiI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 37:23-24 <\/a>), that &ldquo;rises to accuse you&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzQxXQ==\">Isaiah 54:17 <\/a>), that &ldquo;utters duplicity&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODA0XQ==\">Isaiah 59:3 <\/a>), and that demands of them a predatory taxation. Even prior to Assyria&rsquo;s invasion, however, his people&rsquo;s leaders followed the same evil archetype: &ldquo;My people are taken over without price; those who govern them act presumptuously&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzAyXQ==\">Isaiah 52:5 <\/a>). <\/p> ",
