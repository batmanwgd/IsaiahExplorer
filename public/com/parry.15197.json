Similarly, in the last days, \"vengeance cometh speedily upon the ungodly as the whirlwind; and who shall escape it? The Lord's scourge shall pass over by night and by day, and the report thereof shall vex all people; yea, it shall not be stayed until the Lord come; For the indignation of the Lord is kindled against their abominations and all their wicked works. Nevertheless, Zion shall escape if she observe to do all things whatsoever I have commanded her. But if she observe not to do whatsoever I have commanded her, I will visit her according to all her works, with sore affliction, with pestilence, with plague, with sword, with vengeance, with devouring fire\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 97:22-26<\/a>). <\/p> <p><i>vexation only to understand the report. <\/i>When reports of the overflowing scourge reach the ears of the people, this will cause fear and trembling.
