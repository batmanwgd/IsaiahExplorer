It is first mentioned as in the power of Sihon king of the Amorites (<a class=\"ref\">Numbers 21:26<\/a>). On his overthrow it was assigned to the tribe of Reuben (<a class=\"ref\">Numbers 32:37<\/a>), and became a city of the Levites (<a class=\"ref\">Joshua 21:39<\/a>). It had probably fallen into the hands of the Moabites, to whom it had originally belonged (<a class=\"ref\">Numbers 21:26<\/a>). Its ruins exhibit architecture of various periods, Jewish, Roman, and Saracenic; (2) Elealeh, obviously near Heshbon, had shared its fate (<a class=\"ref\">Numbers 32:3; Numbers 32:37<\/a>). The ancient name still attaches to its ruins in the form El-A\u2019al; (3) Jahaz was the scene of the battle between Sihon and the Israelites (<a class=\"ref\">Numbers 21:23; Deuteronomy 2:32; Judges 11:20<\/a>), and was also within the region assigned to Reuben (<a class=\"ref\">Joshua 13:10<\/a>) north of the Arnon. The language of Isaiah implies that it was at some distance from the other two cities. Their cry was to be heard even there. In the Moabite inscription it appears as annexed to Dibon (Records of the Past, xi. 167). Eusebius (Onomast.) names it as between Medeba and Debus, the latter name being probably identical with Dibon. The panic is intensified by the fact that even the \u201carmed soldiers\u201d of Moab are powerless to help, and can only join in the ineffectual wailing.<\/p>",
