Jehovah&rsquo;s <em>sword<\/em> is two, depending on how one reads it: (1) Jehovah&rsquo;s servant (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 31:8-9; 41:2; 49:2<\/a>); or (2) the king of Assyria\/Babylon (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 34:5-6; 65:12; 66:14-16<\/a>). While the archtyrant destroys the wicked of the world, in the end Jehovah&rsquo;s servant subdues the chaotic power of the <em>Sea<\/em> (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 10:26; 11:15; 51:9-10<\/a>) by vanquishing him (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 9:4; 30:30-32; 41:2<\/a>).<\/p>",
