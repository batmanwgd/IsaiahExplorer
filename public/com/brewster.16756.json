    "html": "<p><b>(<a class=\"ref\">2 Nephi 15:8<\/a>).<\/b>\"<i>Woe unto them that join house to house.<\/i>\" This woe is pronounced on the wealthy landowners who covet and buy up property, thus depriving the poor of their heritage. (See <a class=\"ref\">Micah 2:1-2<\/a>.) The law of ancient Israel prescribed that land could not \"be sold for ever.\" (<a class=\"ref\">Leviticus 25:23<\/a>; see also <a class=\"ref\">1 Kings 21<\/a>.) It was to remain within families as a heritage for posterity. When economical circumstances necessitated the sale of land, it was to be returned to the original owners in the year of jubilee, which occurred every fifty years. (LDSBD, \"Jubilee, Year of,\" p. 718.)<\/p>     <p>Another interpretation of this verse has been posited by Monte Nyman. He believes this expression is an indictment of the socialistic practice of a central government controlling the property. Such a system would prevent Zion from being established because it would eliminate the possibility of practicing the law of stewardship and consecration. (GAWI, 43-44.)<\/p>",
