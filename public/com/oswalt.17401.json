It is Babylon as a whole which stands over against God in pride, and it is Babylon as a whole which will be wiped out and whose works will be scattered across the desert. This is so because God will do it. Never far from Isaiah\u2019s consciousness is the direct involvement of God in history. Intermediate causes may abound, but ultimately, when Babylon comes down, it will be because God did it. This consciousness keeps a person from slipping into a \u201cpractical atheism\u201d of thinking and living as though God did not exist. He is the Lord of Hosts, the Almighty, and to fail to take account of him is to destroy ourselves.<\/p>",
