    "html": "<p> (25) Doth he not cast abroad the fitches. . . .?\u2014Modern English would give vetches. Each verb is carefully chosen to describe the special process that belonged to each kind of seed. We have, as it were, an excerpt from the \u201cGeorgics\u201d of Palestine. Identification in such cases is not always easy; but I follow Mr. Carruthers (Bible Educator, i. 38) in reading \u201cfennel seed\u201d for the \u201cfitches\u201d of the English version. This, proverbially among the smallest of seeds, so as to be a type of the microscopic unseen, was scattered broadcast; \u201ccummin,\u201d also proverbial for its smallness, was sown by a like process, with some technical variation, indicated by the use of the Hebrew words. Wheat and barley were \u201cdropped in\u201d more deliberately by the hand of the sower, and then (instead of \u201cthe rie in their place\u201d), \u201cvetches for the borders thereof,\u201d these being used in the East as a kind of herbaceous hedge round the field of corn. The point of the enumeration is that the wise tiller of the soil is discriminating in his methods, and deals with each seed according to its nature. So is it, the prophet suggests through the parable which he does not interpret, with the great Husbandman, whose field is the world, and for whom the nations are as seed. For \u201ccast in the principal wheat . . .\u201d read set the wheat in lines and the barley in the appointed place.<\/p> ",
