    "html": " <p>God destroyed Babylon for the sake of ancient Israel, and for our sake he will destroy modern Babylon, or the world (43:14). As we travel through this telestial world, the Lord provides for us a \"way,\" which is the gospel with its ordinances; and \"rivers\" and \"waters\" (43:19-20), which refer to spiritual drink. In return, we are required to \"shew forth [the Lord's] praise\" (43:21), or to witness to the world that Jehovah is our God.<\/p> <p> Isaiah uses several titles that describe God's relationship to us: <i>Lord<\/i> (Hebrew <i>Yahweh<\/i>), <i>Redeemer, Holy One of Israel, Holy One,<\/i> and <i>King.<\/i><\/p> <blockquote> Thus saith the <i>Lord,<\/i>     <br>your <i>redeemer,<\/i>     <br>the <i>Holy One of Israel;<\/i>     <br>For your sake I have sent to <i>Babylon,<\/i> and have brought down all their nobles,     <br>and the <i>Chaldeans,<\/i> whose cry is in the ships. (43:14)     <br>I am the <i>Lord,<\/i> <u>your Holy One<\/u>,     <br>the <i>creator of Israel,<\/i> <u>your King<\/u>. (43:15)     <br>Thus saith the Lord, which maketh a <i>way<\/i> in the <u>sea<\/u>,     <br>and a <i>path<\/i> in the <u>mighty waters<\/u>; (43:16)     <br>Which bringeth forth <i>the chariot <\/i>and<i> horse,<\/i>     <br><i>the army <\/i>and<i> the power;<\/i>     <br><i>they<\/i> shall <u>lie down<\/u> together,     <br><i>they<\/i> shall <u>not rise<\/u>:     <br><i>they<\/i> are <u>extinct<\/u>,     <br><i>they<\/i> are <u>quenched<\/u> as tow.

(43:18)     <br>Behold, I will do a new thing;     <br>now it shall spring forth; shall ye not know it?     <br>I will even make a <i>way<\/i> in the <u>wilderness<\/u>,     <br>and <i>rivers<\/i> in the <u>desert<\/u>. (43:19)     <br>The <i>beast<\/i> of the field shall honor me,     <br>the [<i>jackals<\/i>] and the <i>owls:<\/i>     <br>because I give <i>waters<\/i> <u>in the wilderness<\/u>,     <br>and <i>rivers<\/i> <u>in the desert<\/u>,     <br>to give <i>drink<\/i> to <u>my people<\/u>,     <br><u>my chosen<\/u>.
