This is a contrast to <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzQ1XQ==\">Isa. 5:5<\/a>, in which he no longer protects Israel because of her nonproductivity, or wickedness.<\/p> <p><i>I will water it every moment. <\/i>For the meaning of <i>water<\/i> here, see <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODE0XQ==\">Isa. 8:6<\/a>. The expression <i>every moment<\/i> indicates that the Lord will give divine attention to the vineyard.<\/p> <p><i>lest any hurt it. <\/i>The Lord will not permit his enemies to destroy the vineyard.<\/p> <p><i>I will guard it night and day. <\/i>A destroyer continually waits to attack, so Jehovah will watch over his vineyard constantly. Similarly, \"He that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep. The Lord is thy keeper: the Lord is thy shade upon thy right hand. The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night. The Lord shall preserve thee from all evil: he shall preserve thy soul\" (<a class=\"ref\">Ps. 121:4-7<\/a>; <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODEyMyI6Mn0=\">Isa. 25:4-5<\/a>). <\/p> ",
