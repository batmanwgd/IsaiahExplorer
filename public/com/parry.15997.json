This blessing had particular significance for those in ancient Israel, who often believed that long life meant God's approval.<\/p> <p><i>child shall not die.<\/i> In the Millennium there will be no death as we now know it\u2014 no infant or child mortality\u2014but when an individual reaches a hundred years old, he or she will be changed from mortality to immortality \"in the twinkling of an eye\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 101:30-31; 63:50<\/a>). <\/p> <p><i>the sinner.<\/i> The Millennium will be a time of righteousness and peace; however, there will still be agency, and some will choose the terrestrial rather than the celestial way of life. Some also will sin against the greater light and will become sons of perdition. <\/p> <p> <i>the sinner, living to be an hundred years old, shall be accursed.<\/i> The curse may be that the sinner, having lived out his years, will suffer for his lack of repentance in the flesh. Rather than having a period of time in the spirit world to meet the demands of justice for his sins, he will live to be one hundred years old and then will be resurrected. That would be a curse if a person needed more time to prepare himself for the judgment of God.<\/p> ",
