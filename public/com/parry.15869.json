    "html": " <p> Those speaking in this passage are probably those once of the covenant who come to realize their spiritual plight. They walk in darkness (59:9), looking for justice and salvation but finding neither (59:11). They know they are in sin (59:12). They have transgressed against the Lord and lied to him, they oppress others, and their society is so corrupt that justice, truth, and equity are far from them (59:14). In fact, those who seek to live righteously become \"a prey\" to all the others (59:15).<\/p> <p>The repetition of certain words and concepts in this passage clearly shows the emphasis on Israel's sin and its consequences: There is no \"judgment\" (59:9, 11, 12), \"justice\" (59:9, 14), \"salvation\" (59:11), \"truth,\" or \"equity\" (59:14-15). The people suffer \"obscurity,\" \"darkness,\" and \"blindness\" (59:9, 10); they \"grope\" and \"stumble\" (59:10). They \"are in desolate places as dead men\" (59:10), and they \"roar\" and \"mourn sore\" (59:11). They know their \"transgressions\" and \"iniquities\"; they know they have departed from God (59:12-13). They confess to \"lying,\" \"speaking oppression and revolt,\" and \"uttering\" falsehoods (59:13). All in all, it is a dismal picture of a people lost in sin, a people who know their sinfulness but who have not yet come to repentance.<\/p> <blockquote>Therefore is <i>judgment<\/i> far from us,     <br>neither doth <i>justice<\/i> overtake us:     <br>we wait for <i>light,<\/i> but behold <u>obscurity<\/u>;     <br>for <i>brightness,<\/i> but we walk in <u>darkness<\/u>. (59:9)     <br><i>We grope<\/i> for the wall <u>like the blind<\/u>,     <br>and <i>we grope<\/i> <u>as if we had no eyes<\/u>:     <br>we stumble at noonday as in the night;     <br>we are in desolate places as dead men.
