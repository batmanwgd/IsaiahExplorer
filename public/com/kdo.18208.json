    "html": "<p> The sins of Israel are sins in words and deeds. <em> \u201cFor your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with iniquity; your lips speak lies, your tongue murmurs wickedness.\u201d<\/em> The verb \u05d2\u05bc\u05d0\u05dc , to spot (see <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODcwXQ==\">Isaiah 63:3<\/a>), is a later softening down of \u05d2\u05bc\u05e2\u05dc (e.g., <a class=\"ref\">2 Samuel 1:21<\/a>); and in the place of the <em> niphal<\/em> \u05e0\u05d2\u05d0\u05dc (<a class=\"ref\">Zephaniah 3:1<\/a>), we have here, as in <a class=\"ref\">Lamentations 4:14<\/a>, the double passive form \u05e0\u05d2\u05d0\u05dc , compounded of <em> niphal<\/em> and <em> pual<\/em> . The post-biblical <em> nithpa\u00ebl<\/em> , compounded of the <em> niphal<\/em> and the <em> hithpael<\/em> , is a mixed form of the same kind, though we also meet with it in a few biblical passages (<a class=\"ref\">Deuteronomy 21:8; Proverbs 27:15; Ezekiel 23:48<\/a>). The verb <em> ha\u0302ga\u0302h <\/em> (lxx \u03bc\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u0342 ) combines the two meanings of \u201cthought\u201d (meditation or reflection), and of a light low \u201cexpression,\u201d half inward half outward.<\/p>",
