    "html": " <i>sword of the Lord is filled with blood. <\/i>The destruction of the wicked is so great that the sword of the Lord is covered with blood.<\/p> <p> <i>blood\/fatness\/kidneys.<\/i> In the Mosaic law of sacrifice, the blood and fat of a sacrificed animal are reserved for the Lord (<a class=\"ref\">Lev. 3:15-17<\/a>). By using these three words in the context of the slaughter of the wicked, Isaiah emphasizes the Lord's right to exact the penalty for iniquity. It is noteworthy that blood and kidneys, with other internal organs, regulate the life of humans and beasts. The Lord's slaughter will be complete, claiming the very life force of the wicked.<\/p> <p><i>lambs, goats, rams.<\/i> These sacrificial animals were used for sin and trespass offerings to symbolically cleanse the repentant offerer from both willful and inadvertent sins. In this context, it may suggest that the wicked will have to die for their own sins because they would not partake of the blessings of the sacrifice of Christ.<\/p> <p><i>sacrifice\/slaughter.<\/i> These are parallel terms. Those who did not accept Jesus' atoning sacrifice will be slaughtered as are the sacrificial animals in the temple (<a class=\"ref\">Jer. 46:10; Rev. 19:17-18<\/a>). <\/p> <p><i>Bozrah\/Idumea.<\/i> Bozrah (perhaps modern Busra) is the capital of Edom, here called Idumea. Both Bozrah and Idumea represent the world (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 1:36<\/a>) and will be destroyed by the Lord (<a class=\"ref\">Ezek. 25:14<\/a>). <\/p> ",
