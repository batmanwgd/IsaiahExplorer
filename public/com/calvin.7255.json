    "html": " <p> <i>For he will bring down the inhabitants of loftiness. <\/i> He now explains more fully what is that power of God of which he spoke. It is that which we ourselves feel, and which is exerted for our benefit. The two clauses are therefore closely connected, that \u201cthe proud are laid low by the power of God,\u201d and that \u201cthe lowly and despised are placed in their room;\u201d for it would not have yielded full consolation to tell us, in the first place, that \u201cthe proud will be laid low,\u201d if he had not likewise added, that \u201cthe lowly will be exalted,\u201d so as to hold dominion over the proud. We therefore acknowledge, that in our own experience God works powerfully for our salvation, and this yields to us a ground of hope. <\/p> \n <p>Under the word <i>loftiness <\/i> he includes not only bulwarks and fortifications of every kind, (for the ancients were wont to build their cities in lofty places,) but also wealth and magnificence. He therefore means, that no defense can prevent God from casting down the wicked, and laying them low. Towers and bulwarks, indeed, are not displeasing to God; but as it rarely happens that they who are strong and powerful are not proud, so <i>loftiness <\/i> frequently denotes <i>pride<\/i>. Unquestionably he speaks of the wicked, who have abundance of arms, forces, and money, and imagine that they are protected against God himself. He likewise comforts the Jews, as we have formerly said, because the invincible power of Babylon might have terrified them and thrown them into despair, if the Lord had not supported them by this promise: \u201cYou have no reason for being terrified at the greatness or strength of Babylon; for she will quickly fall, and will not stand before the power of the Lord.\u201d <\/p> ",
