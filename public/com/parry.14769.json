The river spoken of here is the great Euphrates that flowed through Assyria, but Isaiah uses the river as a metaphor for the \"king of Assyria\" (8:7) and his armies. Other prophets have similarly likened armies to great rivers and floods that \"cover the earth\" and \"destroy the city and the inhabitants thereof\" (<a class=\"ref\">Jer. 46:8; 47:2<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\">Amos 8:8; Dan. 9:26<\/a>), just as Noah warned his contemporaries of the worldwide flood that would destroy all creatures save those who found salvation on the ark (<a class=\"ref\">Gen. 6:5-17<\/a>). <\/p> <p><i>channels\/banks.<\/i> The waters of the river (the king of Assyria and his armies) will be very destructive when they flood Israel.<\/p> ",
