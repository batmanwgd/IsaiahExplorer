And proceeding in this tone, it pauses here once more to reflect as at the close of a strophe. <em> \u201cIf favour is shown to the wicked man, he does not learn righteousness; in the most upright land he acts wickedly, and has no eye for the majesty of Jehovah.\u201d<\/em> \u05e8\u05e9\u05c1\u05e2 \u05d9\u05d7\u05df is a hypothetical clause, which is left to be indicated by the emphasis, like <a class=\"ref\">Nehemiah 1:8<\/a> (Ewald, \u00a7357,<em> b<\/em> ): granting that favour (<em> che\u0304n <\/em> = \u201cgoodness,\u201d <a class=\"ref\">Romans 2:4<\/a>) is constantly shown to the wicked man. \u201c<em> The most upright land:<\/em> \u201d <em> 'eretz necochoth <\/em> is a land in which everything is right, and all goes honourably. A worthless man, supposing he were in such a land, would still act knavishly; and of the majesty of Jehovah, showing itself in passing punishments of sin, though still sparing him, he would have no perception whatever. The prophet utters this with a painful feeling of indignation; the word <em> bal <\/em> indicating denial with emotion.<\/p>",
