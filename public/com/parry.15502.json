    "html": " <i>Sing unto the Lord a new song. <\/i>Singing a new song unto the Lord is mentioned ten times in the scriptures (see, for example, <a class=\"ref\">Ps. 40:3; 98:1<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\"> 149:1; Rev. 5:9<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\"> 14:3; D&amp;C 84:98<\/a>). Each time the song is one of praise. Such songs appear to be called <i>new<\/i> because they praise the Lord for <i>new<\/i> works of glory and blessing. The Lord commands the entire earth to sing a new song unto him.<\/p> <p><i>end of the earth. <\/i>To this phrase Isaiah adds <i>ye that go down to the sea,<\/i> the isles and their inhabitants, the wilderness and its cities, villages of Kedar, <i>inhabitants of the rock,<\/i> and <i>islands.<\/i> All peoples and creatures on the earth and in the sea are called to sing praises to the Lord, because he comes in power and glory to destroy the wicked and establish his reign.<\/p> ",
