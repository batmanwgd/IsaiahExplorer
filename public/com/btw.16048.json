Grass springs up after the rain, but doesn't last long when the heat is on. Terry B. Ball has written:  <\/p>  <blockquote>  Occasionally an east wind, heated by the desert sands of Arabia, will sweep across the country, withering the vegetation as if in a furnace. In Isaiah this phenomenon is used as a type of the brief existence of mortality (\"Isaiah's Imagery of Plants and Planting,\" 26.)  <\/blockquote>  <p>  <b>2 Nephi 8:14. \"The captive exile hasteneth\"<\/b> Covenant Israel who have been scattered or exiled, \"held captive by oppressors, will soon be set free. They will not 'die in the pit' (go down to the grave) nor be deprived of food\" (Brewster, <i>Isaiah Plain and Simple,<\/i> 224).  <\/p>  <p>  <b>2 Nephi 8:15. \"Whose waves roared\"<\/b> What might this refer to? It's nice to live in the last days (Nephi's fourth key) when we have very helpful footnotes that show us how the scriptures comment on the scriptures. Footnote 15<i>a<\/i> takes us to 1 Nephi 4:2:  <\/p>  <blockquote>  Therefore let us go up; let us be strong like unto Moses; for he truly spake unto the waters of the Red Sea and they divided hither and thither, and our fathers came through, out of captivity, on dry ground, and the armies of Pharaoh did follow and were drowned in the waters of the Red Sea.  <\/blockquote>  ",
