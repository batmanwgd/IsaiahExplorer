A sure sign of covenant keeping is Sabbath observance (<a class=\"ref\">Exodus 20:8-11; 31:13<\/a>), which involves desisting &ldquo;from achieving your own ends on my holy day... considering the Sabbath a delight, the holy [day] of Jehovah venerable... refraining from your everyday pursuits&mdash;from occupying yourselves with your own affairs and speaking of [business] matters&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODAwXQ==\">Isaiah 58:13<\/a>). Still, covenant keeping consists not only of avoiding evil but of actively doing good (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc2NzEiOjJ9LFsxODYzMl1d\">Isaiah 1:16-17; 48:17<\/a>). <\/p> ",
