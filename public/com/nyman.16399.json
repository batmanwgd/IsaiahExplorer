    "html": "          <p>The Prophet Joseph Smith provided this enlightening comment on verse 11:<\/p>     <p>The time has at last arrived when the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, has set his hand again the second time to recover the remnants of his people, which have been left from Assyria, and from Egypt, and from Pathros, and from Cush, and from Elam, and from Shinar, and from Hamath, and from the islands of the sea, and with them to bring in the fulness of the Gentiles, and establish that covenant with <i>them,<\/i> which was promised when their sins should be taken away. See Isaiah xi; Romans xi:25, 26 and 27, and also Jeremiah xxxi:31, 32 and 33. This covenant has never been established with the house of Israel, nor with the house of Judah, for it requires two parties to make a covenant, and those two parties must be agreed, or no covenant can be made.<\/p>     <p>Christ, in days of His flesh, proposed to make a covenant with them, but they rejected Him and His proposals, and in consequence therof, they were broken off, and no covenant was made with them at that time. But their unbelief has not rendered the promise of God of none effect: no, for there was another day limited in David, which was the day of His power; and then His people, Israel, should be a willing people; <b>-<\/b>andHe would write His law in their hearts, and print it in their thoughts; their sins and their iniquities He would remember no more. (TPJS, pp. 14-15.)<\/p>     <p>Elder Orson Pratt identified the outcasts of Israel spoken of in verse 12 as the ten tribes: \"Here is a declaration that the two great kingdoms of Israel-its 'outcasts,' the ten tribes, scattered seven hundred and twenty years before Christ, and the 'dispersed of Judah,' dispersed among all nations, shall be gathered. But before he gathers them he will set up an ensign-an ensign is to be raised in the latter-days especially for the gathering of Israel.\" (JD, 14:66.) Thus there are three separate phases of the gathering spoken of in verse 12. President Joseph Fielding Smith also identified Ephraim as the ten tribes, Judah as the two tribes, and the Philistines (in verse 14) as the Gentiles (see AQ, 2:181).<\/p>     <p>The Lord's setting his hand the second time to recover his people is associated with the \"marvellous work and a wonder\" prophesied in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MjA4XQ==\">Isaiah 29:14<\/a> and in <a class=\"ref\">2 Ne. 25:17<\/a> and 29:1. The standard or \"ensign\" spoken of in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODk3XQ==\">Isaiah 11:12<\/a> is identified in <a class=\"ref\">2 Ne. 29:2<\/a> as the words of Nephi's seed (the Book of Mormon). This has also been more broadly interpreted by the General Authorities as The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Typical of such statements is one by Elder LeGrand Richards which adds the notation that no other church is accomplishing what this Church is doing for its members and that people come to the Church to learn how it accomplishes what it does (see CR, Oct. 1975, p. <i>77).<\/i> This certainly fits the concept of an ensign. Jacob, the Book of Mormon prophet, said that the day the Lord set his hand the second time to recover his people would be the day the Lord would send his servants to prune his vineyard for \"the last time,\" as foretold in the allegory of Zenos (see <a class=\"ref\">Jacob 6:2<\/a>).<\/p>     ",
