The parallel terms &ldquo;salvation&rdquo; and &ldquo;Rock&rdquo; show that Israel&rsquo;s God personifies<em>salvation<\/em> , that he is their<em>rock<\/em> or refuge in the time of trouble (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3OTAzLDE4ODY2XQ==\">Isaiah 12:2; 62:11<\/a>). His people&rsquo;s relationship with him is personal: &ldquo;I myself am Jehovah; apart from me there is no savior&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NTE3XQ==\">Isaiah 43:11<\/a>); &ldquo;Ever trust in Jehovah, for Jehovah, Yah, is an everlasting<em>Rock<\/em> &rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTM1XQ==\">Isaiah 26:4<\/a> ; emphasis added). To be saved, they must come to him.<\/p> ",
