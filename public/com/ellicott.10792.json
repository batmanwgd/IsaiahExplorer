A like denunciation meets us in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 32:9-12<\/a>, but this is without a parallel in the minuteness of its detail. It is as though the prophet had gone into the boudoir of one of the leaders of the fashions of Jerusalem, and taken an inventory of what he found there. Possibly we may trace the influence of the prophetess-wife of Isaiah (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTc4MTE=\">Isaiah 8:3<\/a>), seeking to recall those of her own sex to a higher life. We note, on a smaller scale, a like teaching in the married apostle (<a class=\"ref\">1 Peter 3:3-4<\/a>). Twenty-one distinct articles are mentioned.

The custom still exists in Syria and Arabia, though forbidden by the Koran. English nursery rhymes seem to recall a time when it was not unknown in Western Europe.<\/p>",
