    "html": "<p><b>(<a class=\"ref\">2 Nephi 13:12<\/a>).<\/b>\"<i>Children are their oppressors, and women rule over them.<\/i>\" Sidney Sperry applied the following meaning to this phrase: \"The leaders of the people act like children in maltreating those who come under their rule, and the corrupting influence of their prominent women is also felt. In other words, the leaders of the people are misleaders; they bring about apostasy with their false teachings and exploit the helpless poor.\" (BMC, 181.)<\/p>     <p>On the other hand, Victor Ludlow commented that Isaiah is repeating \"his earlier warning of social upheaval, suggesting that the leaders will be as weak as or will actually be women, an insult in ancient Israelite culture. This implies a dissolution of the traditional patriarchal social structure that was the norm of the time.\" (IPSP, 106.)<\/p>",
