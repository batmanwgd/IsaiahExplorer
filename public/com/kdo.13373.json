And your booty is swept away as a swarm of locusts sweeps away; as beetles run, they run upon it.\u201d<\/i>, The indeterminate <i>(<span class=\"translit\">, ha\u0302mo\u0304n <\/span>), which produces for that very reason the impression of something mysterious and terrible, is at once explained. The noise comes from Jehovah, who is raising Himself judicially above Assyria, and thunders as a judge. Then the hostile army runs away (<span class=\"normal hebrew\">,\u05e0\u05e4\u05e6\ufb35<\/span>= <span class=\"normal hebrew\">,\u05e0\u05e4\ufb46\ufb35<\/span>, from the <i>niphal <\/i> <span class=\"normal hebrew\">,\u05e0\u05e4\u05e5<\/span>, <a class=\"ref\">1 Samuel 13:11<\/a>, from <span class=\"normal hebrew\">,\ufb44\u05e5<\/span>= <span class=\"normal hebrew\">,\u05e0\u05e4\u05d5\u05e5<\/span>, from <span class=\"normal hebrew\">,\ufb44\ufb35\u05e5 <\/span>); and your booty (the address returns to Assyria) is swept away, just as when a swarm of locusts settles on a field, it soon eats it utterly away. Jerome, Cappellus, and others follow the Septuagint rendering, <span class=\"greek normal\">,\u03bf\u0314\u0300\u03bd \u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u0301\u03c0\u03bf\u03bd \u03b5\u0313\u03b1\u0301\u03bd \u03c4\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03b1\u03b3\u03b1\u0301\u03b3\u03b7 \u03b1\u0313\u03ba\u03c1\u03b9\u0301\u03b4\u03b1\u03c2<\/span>,. The figure is quite as appropriate, but the article in <i>(<span class=\"translit\">, hecha\u0302s\u0131\u0304l<\/span>) makes the other view the more natural one; and <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4Mjg0XQ==\">Isaiah 33:4<\/a><\/i>, places this beyond all doubt. (<span class=\"translit\">, Sha\u0302qaq <\/span>), from which the participle (<span class=\"translit\">, sho\u0304qe\u0304q<\/span>) and the substantive (<span class=\"translit\">, massha\u0302q<\/span>) are derived, is sued here, as in <a class=\"ref\">Joel 2:9<\/a>, to signify a busy running hither and thither (discursitare <\/i>). The syntactic use of (<span class=\"translit\">, sho\u0304qe\u0304q<\/span>) is the same as that of <span class=\"normal hebrew\">,\u05e7\u05e8\u05d0<\/span>, (they call) in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MDQ3XQ==\">Isaiah 21:11<\/a>, and (<span class=\"translit\">, so\u0304phed\u0131\u0304m<\/span>) (they smite) in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MjcyXQ==\">Isaiah 32:12<\/a>. The inhabitants of Jerusalem swarm in the enemy's camp like beetles; they are all in motion, and carry off what they can. <br> <\/p>",
