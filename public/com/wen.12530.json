    "html": "Burden - The burden of the Assyrian. The anointing - Possibly this may be understood of David, who is often mentioned in scripture by the name of God's anointed; and for whose sake, God gave many deliverances to the succeeding kings and ages, as is expressly affirmed,  <a class=\"ref\">1 Kings 11:32 ,  1 Kings 11:34<\/a> . God declares that he would give this very deliverance from the Assyrian, for David's sake,  <a class=\"ref\">2 Kings 19:34 ,  2 Kings 20:6<\/a> . But the Messiah is principally intended, of whom David was but a type; and who was in a particular manner anointed above his fellows, as is said,  <a class=\"ref\">Psalm 45:7<\/a> . For he is the foundation of all the promises,  <a class=\"ref\">2 Corinthians 1:20<\/a> , and of all the deliverances and mercies granted to God's people in all ages.",
