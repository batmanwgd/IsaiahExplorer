Those who wait upon the Lord will receive salvation (<a class=\"ref\">Prov. 20:22<\/a>), physical and spiritual strength (40:31), and eventually the earth for their inheritance (<a class=\"ref\">Ps. 37:9,  34<\/a>). <\/p> <p> <i>hideth his face.<\/i> This idiom indicates that the Spirit of the Lord has been withdrawn (8:20-22; see also <a class=\"ref\">Ezek. 39:29<\/a> ) and God's blessings have been removed from the house of Jacob. On the one hand, God hides his face from those who demonstrate a lack of faith and practice evil (<a class=\"ref\">Deut. 32:20; Micah 3:4<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\">Deut. 31:17-18<\/a>) on the other hand, God shows his face to those who are pure in heart (<a class=\"ref\">Matt. 5:8; D&amp;C 93:1<\/a>). <\/p> <p><i>I will look for him.<\/i> The literal translation reads, \"I will hope for him.\" With regard to our hope in Christ, Jacob wrote: \"For this intent have we written these things, that they may know that we knew of Christ, and we had a hope of his glory many hundred years before his coming; and not only we ourselves had a hope of his glory, but also all the holy prophets which were before us\" (<a class=\"ref\">Jacob 4:4<\/a>). <\/p> ",
