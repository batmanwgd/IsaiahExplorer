    "html": " <p>In the gathering, the Lord will provide loving caretakers to help Israel on her way. \"The Gentiles&hellip;shall bring thy sons in their arms,&hellip;and kings shall be thy nursing fathers\" (49:22-23). These people of power, rather than requiring that Israel bow down to them, \"shall bow down\" to Israel, giving great respect and honor to the returning children of Israel (49:23). These gentiles and kings and queens will \"know that I am the Lord\" (49:23) and that returning Israel is on the Lord's errand. Even those who are \"captives\" will come (49:24). The Lord will take them away from their captors, and he will \"contend with him that contendeth with thee\" (49:25). Captives might be those in bondage to political systems, to false religions, or to sin.<\/p> <p>Apparently during this same time there will be great and devastating civil wars on the earth (49:26). As a result of God's judgments, all the earth will know that Jehovah is the Savior (49:26).<\/p> <blockquote> Thus saith the Lord God,     <br>Behold, I will l<i>ift up mine hand<\/i> to the <u>Gentiles<\/u>,     <br>and <i>set up my standard<\/i> to the <u>people<\/u>:     <br>and they shall <i>bring thy sons<\/i> in their <u>arms<\/u>,     <br>and <i>thy daughters shall be carried<\/i> upon their <u>shoulders<\/u>.
