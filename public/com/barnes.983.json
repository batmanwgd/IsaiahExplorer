    "html": " <p> <em>And righteousness shall be the gridle of his loins <\/em>&mdash;The sense of this verse is plain. He will always exhibit himself as a just and faithful king. &ldquo;The girdle of the loins&rdquo; refers to the cincture, or band, with which the ancients girded themselves. A part of their dress consisted of an outward, loose, flowing robe. This robe it was necessary to gird up, or to confine close to the body in active labor, or in running; and the meaning of the figure used here is, probably, that the virtues of righteousness and justice would adhere to him as closely and inseparably as the garment does to the body to which it was bound. The figure of representing the virtues as clothing, or describing them as parts of dress with which we are invested, is common in the Scriptures: <\/p> <p>I put on righteousness, and it clothes me; <\/p> <p>My judgment was as a robe and a diadem. <\/p> ",
