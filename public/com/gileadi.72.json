As Pharaoh&rsquo;s armies were unable to penetrate the cloud when they pursued after Jehovah&rsquo;s people (<a class=\"ref\">Exodus 14:19-20<\/a>), so in that day will no enemies molest those who participate in Zion&rsquo;s solemn assemblies. According to the terms of his covenant, Jehovah is obligated to protect his people when they keep his law and word. His divine intervention attests to their utmost compliance.<\/p>",
