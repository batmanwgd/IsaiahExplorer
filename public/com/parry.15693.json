    "html": " <i>the prey\/mighty\/captives.<\/i> The context of 49:24 tells us that <i>prey\/captives<\/i> refers to God's \"covenant people,\" who are in bondage to the gentiles. The <i>mighty<\/i> (called \"the terrible\" in 49:25) could also refer to Satan, who makes us his captives when we sin. The prey shall indeed be \"taken from the mighty,\" by God, who is mightier than all.<\/p> <p><i>lawful captives.<\/i> The description of being made captive by legal right may suggest that Israel was taken legitimately according to the rules of warfare, or that she is captive to Satan according to the law of justice. But, in his mercy, God's claim to his children supersedes the claims of all others.<\/p> ",
