    "html": "<p>The two northern rulers&rsquo; scheme to invade the Kingdom of Judah and replace Ahaz with one of their own&mdash;the son of Tabeal&mdash;is an &ldquo;evil&rdquo; plot (<em>ra&lsquo;a<\/em>) because it contravenes Jehovah&rsquo;s unconditional promise to King David of an everlasting dynasty of kings to rule on David&rsquo;s throne (<a class=\"ref\">Psalm 89:3-4; Jeremiah 33:17-21<\/a>). The name Tabeal&mdash;a compound of the words &ldquo;not&rdquo; (<em>&rsquo;al<\/em>) and &ldquo;good&rdquo; (<em>tab\/tob<\/em>)&mdash;implies that the proposed puppet ruler is not a descendant of David. Because the word &ldquo;good&rdquo; signifies covenant keeping and covenant blessing, a name that means &ldquo;No Good&rdquo; implies the opposite.<\/p>",
