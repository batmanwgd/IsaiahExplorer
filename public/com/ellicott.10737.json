    "html": " <p> (8) The daughter of Zion.\u2014The phrase stands, as everywhere (<a class=\"ref\">Psalms 45:12; Lamentations 2:8; Micah 4:10<\/a>), for the ideal city personified. <\/p> \n <p>Is left as a cottage in a vineyard . . .\u2014The \u201chut,\u201d or \u201cbooth,\u201d in which the keeper of the vineyards dwelt, apart from other habitations, was an almost proverbial type of isolation, yet to such a state was Zion all but reduced. The second similitude is of the same character. Cucumbers and other plants of the gourd type (<a class=\"ref\">Jonah 4:6<\/a>) were largely cultivated in Jud\u00e6a, and here, too, each field or garden, like the olive groves and vineyards of Italy, had its solitary hut. <\/p> \n <p>As a besieged city.\u2014The comparison of the besieged city to itself is at first startling. Rhetorically, however, it forms a climax. The city was not at this time actually besieged, but it was so hemmed in with perils, so isolated from all help, that this was what its condition practically came to. It was neither more nor less than \u201cas a besieged city,\u201d or \u2018within a measurable distance\u2019 of becoming so. <\/p> ",
