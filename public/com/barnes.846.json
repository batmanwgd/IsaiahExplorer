This was to be a &ldquo;punishment&rdquo; for their dissipation at their feasts.<\/p><p><em>And their multitude<\/em>&mdash;The mass, or body of the nation; the common people.<\/p><p><em>Dried up with thirst<\/em>&mdash;Are punished in this manner for their indulgence in drinking. The punishment here specified, refers particularly to a journey through an arid, desolate region, where drink could be obtained only with difficulty. Such was the route which the nation was compelled afterward to take in going to Babylon.<\/p> ",
