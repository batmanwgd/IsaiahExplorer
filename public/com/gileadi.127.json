Sanctifying Jehovah&mdash;honoring him by living a pure and consecrated life&mdash;leads to his sanctuary where he receives those who love him (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTg3ODE=\">vv 16-17; Isaiah 57:15<\/a>). That sanctuary serves Jehovah&rsquo;s holy ones as a place of protection in his Day of Judgment (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzczNyI6NH0=\">Isaiah 4:3-6<\/a>) while the unholy suffer perils and perish.<\/p><p>Instead of being a <em>Rock<\/em> of salvation to his unrepentant people (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3OTk0LDE4MTM1LDE4MjQ3LDE4NTQyXQ==\">Isaiah 17:10; 26:4; 30:29; 44:8<\/a>), Jehovah is a &ldquo;stumbling block&rdquo; and &ldquo;obstructing rock,&rdquo; letting them stumble over his word and fall prey to their enemies&mdash;to be broken, ensnared, and taken captive by the king of Assyria\/Babylon in his Day of Judgment&mdash;the same as with the wicked of the world (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3sic2luZ2xlcyI6WzE3OTQ2LDE4MTc4XX0seyIxNzg1NCI6NH0seyIxODExMyI6Mn1d\">Isaiah 10:3-6; 14:17; 24:17-18; 28:13<\/a>). Because Jehovah is the same yesterday, today, and forever, what he does in ancient times&mdash;both for good and for evil&mdash;establishes a pattern for what he does in the end-time, when history repeats itself.<\/p>",
