President Joseph Fielding Smith (see DS, 3:346-47), Elder LeGrand Richards (see CR, Oct. 1966, p. 42), Elder Milton R. Hunter (see CR, Oct. 1965, p. 81), and Elder Orson Pratt (see JD, 18:145) have all so interpreted these verses. However, the Doctrine and Covenants gives a broader interpretation: it refers to Jacob's flourishing in the wilderness and the Lamanites' blossoming as a rose, noting also that Zion will flourish upon the hills and be assembled to the place which the Lord has appointed (see <a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 49:24-25<\/a>). <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODMyMiI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 35:1-2<\/a> is frequently said to refer to a blossoming taking place in the land of Judah; obviously, the Lord can and will make more than one place blossom as he gathers his people (see <a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 117:6-8<\/a>).<\/p>     ",
