This latter is the word used in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4Njg3XQ==\">Isaiah 51:13<\/a>; just before, in the very same sentence; and this phrase occurs very frequently in Isaiah, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDQzLDE4NDg2LDE4NTU4LDE4NTc0XQ==\">Isaiah 40:22, Isaiah 42:5, Isaiah 44:24, Isaiah 45:12<\/a>; the former in no other place. It is also very remarkable, that in the Samaritan text, <a class=\"ref\">Numbers 24:6<\/a>, these two words are twice changed by mistake, one for the other, in the same verse. <\/p>",
