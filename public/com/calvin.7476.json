We may infer that it was a town in Media, though some think that it was situated elsewhere; but it is enough that, with regard to Jerusalem, it lay in an easterly direction. <i>Haran <\/i> is often mentioned in Scripture. Pliny places this town in Arabia; but it is more generally believed to have been in Mesopotamia, and this is confirmed by the journeyings of Abraham, who came to it along with his father, after having left his native country Chaldaea. (<a class=\"ref\">Acts 7:24; Genesis 11:31 <\/a>.) It is called Charrae, in the plural number, by heathen historians, who also mention that Crassus and his son were killed there. <\/p> ",
