    "html": " <i>mouth like a sharp sword.<\/i> This term refers to the power of the message brought by God's servant. It is an expression common in revelation (Heb. 4:12; <a class=\"ref\">Rev. 1:16; D&amp;C 6:2<\/a>, for example). Nephi spoke of the truth cutting people \"to the very center\" (<a class=\"ref\">1 Ne. 16:2<\/a>). <\/p> <p><i>shadow of his hand.<\/i> A place of ultimate safety (51:16).<\/p> <p> <i>in his quiver hath he hid me.<\/i> This phrase may refer to God's protection: God may have hidden the servant from the knowledge of the world, or He may have sheltered him from harm. Alternatively, the Lord's covenant with Abraham declares that even though Abraham's righteous seed were lost, or hid, from the world, both literally and figuratively (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 86:8-9<\/a>), God knows where they are and protects them \"in the shadow of his hand&hellip;in his quiver.\"<\/p> <p><i>sharp sword\/polished shaft\/quiver.<\/i> Through God's power, the servant is fully prepared and ready for the accomplishment of his mission. Though lacking sharpness of himself,<b> <\/b>he will be refined and \"polished\" by the Lord. Joseph Smith referred to this prophecy in relation to himself: \"I am like a huge, rough stone rolling down from a high mountain; and the only polishing I get is when some corner gets rubbed off by coming in contact with something else, striking with accelerated force against religious bigotry, priestcraft,&hellip;corrupt men and women\u2014all hell knocking off a corner here and a corner there. Thus I will become a smooth and polished shaft in the quiver of the Almighty.\" Joseph Smith also applied phrases from this verse to his brother Hyrum, and they could be applied to anyone who is polished to the point of having his or her calling and election made sure.<\/p> ",
