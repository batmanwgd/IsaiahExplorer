    "html": "<p> But no shame makes him faint-hearted; he trusts in Him who hath called him, and looks to the end. <em> \u201cBut the Lord Jehovah will help me; therefore have I not suffered myself to be overcome by mockery: therefore did I make my face like the flint, and knew that I should not be put to shame.\u201d<\/em> The \u05d5 introduces the thought with which his soul was filled amidst all his sufferings. In \u05e0\u05db\u05dc\u05de\u05ea\u05bc\u05d9 \u05dc\u05d0 he affirms, that he did not suffer himself to be inwardly overcome and overpowered by <em> k e limma\u0302h <\/em> . The consciousness of his high calling remained undisturbed; he was never ashamed of that, nor did he turn away from it. The two \u05e2\u05dc\u05be\u05db\u05bc\u05df stand side by side upon the same line. He made his face <em> kachalla\u0302m\u0131\u0304sh <\/em> (from <em> c ha\u0302lam <\/em> , related to <em> ga\u0302lam <\/em> in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NjU4XQ==\">Isaiah 49:21<\/a>, with the substantive termination <em> \u0131\u0304sh <\/em> : see <em> Jeshurun<\/em> , p. 229), i.e., he made it as unfelling as a flint-stone to the attacks of his foes (cf., <a class=\"ref\">Ezekiel 3:8-9<\/a>). The lxx renders this \u03b5\u0313\u0301\u03b8\u03b7\u03ba\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u0300 \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u0301\u03c3\u03c9\u03c0\u03bf\u03bd \u03bc\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c9\u0314\u03c2 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b5\u03b1\u0300\u03bd \u03c0\u03b5\u0301\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd ; but \u03b5\u0313\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u0301\u03c1\u03b9\u03be\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u0300 \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u0301\u03c2 , which is the rendering given to \u05e4\u05e0\u05d9 \u05e9\u05c2\u05d9\u05dd in <a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 21:10<\/a>, would have been just the proper rendering here (see <a class=\"ref\">Luke 9:51<\/a>). In \u201choly hardness of endurance,\u201d as Stier says, he turned his face to his antagonists, without being subdued or frightened away, and was well assured that He whose cause he represented would never leave him in the lurch.<\/p>",
