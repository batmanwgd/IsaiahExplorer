These earthly garments and robes, when one is purified, will be exchanged for eternal robes of glory. Jacob compared the robe of righteousness to \"being clothed with purity\" (<a class=\"ref\">2 Ne. 9:14; Ps. 132:16<\/a>; <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MDc0XQ==\">Isa. 22:21<\/a>). <\/p> <p><i>bridegroom&hellip;ornaments\/bride&hellip;jewels.<\/i> We will be adorned with the Lord's blessings as a bridegroom and bride are adorned with ornaments on their wedding day.<\/p> ",
