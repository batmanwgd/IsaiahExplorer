In this setting Isaiah also became a type of Christ. <i>Send<\/i> where? Isaiah is sent to the world to bear witness of Christ and to declare his word.<\/p> <p> <i>who will go for us?<\/i> <i>Go<\/i> where? Isaiah is sent to <i>go<\/i> among the people of his day to proclaim God's word of warning and judgment. The plural pronoun <i>us<\/i> sug- gests that there were others in God's heavenly throne room. In John's vision of the heavenly temple (<a class=\"ref\">Rev. 4-5<\/a>), we read of exalted Saints and others near God's throne in heaven (<a class=\"ref\">Gen. 1:26; 3:22<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\"> 11:7<\/a>). <\/p> <p><i>Here am I.<\/i> This saying is often connected to the calling of the Lord's servants (<a class=\"ref\">Gen. 22:1; Ex. 3:4<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\">1 Sam. 3:4-8; Abr. 3:27<\/a>). It seems to have the meaning of \"I am here ready to obey your commandments concerning me.\"<\/p> ",
