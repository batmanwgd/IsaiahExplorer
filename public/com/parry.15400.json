Sick nigh unto death, he \"prayed unto the Lord\" (38:2); after he is healed, he writes a psalm praising and giving thanks to the Lord for the blessings of healing and deliverance from sin (38:17). Like Hezekiah, we should praise God in prayer after we are healed from sickness and disease, both spiritual and physical; and we, like this great king, should teach our children of God's truth (38:19).<\/i><\/p> ",
