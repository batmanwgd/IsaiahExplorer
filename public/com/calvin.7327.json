    "html": "<p><i>Then shall the humble again take joy in Jehovah. <\/i>Such is my translation of this passage, while others render it, \u201cThey shall add,\u201d or \u201ccontinue to rejoice;\u201d for the Prophet describes not a \u201cjoy\u201d which is continued but rather a \u201cjoy\u201d which is new. As if he had said, \u201cThough they are now distressed and sorrowful, yet I will give them occasion of gladness, so that they shall again be filled with \u201cjoy.\u201d He speaks of the \u201chumble;\u201d and hence it ought to be observed that our afflictions prepare us for receiving the grace of God; for the Lord casts us down and afflicts us, that he may afterwards raise us up. Thus, when the Lord corrects his people, we ought not to lose heart, but should recall to remembrance those statements, that we may always hope for better things, and may believe that, after such calamities and distresses, he will at length bring joy to his Church. Yet we again learn from it what I briefly mentioned a little before, that the grace of illumination does not belong indiscriminately to all; for, although all have been chastened together, yet not all have had their hearts subdued by affliction, so as truly to become \u201cpoor in spirit,\u201d or \u201cmeek.\u201d (<a class=\"ref\">Matthew 5:3<\/a>.) <\/p>",
