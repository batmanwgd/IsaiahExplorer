    "html": " <p>This section presents God's charge against Israel. Isaiah's words remind us of a courtroom scene, in which God is both the plaintiff and the judge (3:13: \"The Lord standeth up to plead, and standeth to judge the people\"; 3:12-15; 5:1-7), the heavens and earth are the witnesses, and Israel is the defendant. The Lord calls his witnesses (1:2a), presents his case and indictment (1:2b-5a, 10-16, 29-31), and pronounces judgment against Israel (1:5b-9). Israel is charged with breaking the covenant and committing great sins.<\/p> <blockquote> <i>Hear,<\/i> O <u>heavens<\/u>,     <br>and <i>give ear,<\/i> O <u>earth<\/u>     <br>For the Lord hath spoken,     <br><i>I <\/i> have nourished and brought up <u>children<\/u>,     <br>and <u>they<\/u> have rebelled against <i>me.<\/i> (1:2)     <br>The <i>ox<\/i> knoweth his <u>owner<\/u>     <br>and the <i>ass<\/i> his <u>master's<\/u> [feeding-trough]     <br>but <i>Israel<\/i> doth not <u>know<\/u>,     <br><i>my people<\/i> doth not [<u>understand<\/u>].
