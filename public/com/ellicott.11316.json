So the Targum gives \u201cThine eyes shall see the Shekinah of the King of Ages.\u201d Their primary meaning is, however, obviously historical. The \u201cking\u201d is Hezekiah, who shall be seen no longer in sackcloth and ashes, and with downcast eyes (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MzU0XQ==\">Isaiah 37:1<\/a>), but in all the \u201cbeauty\u201d of triumph and of majesty, of a youth and health renewed like the eagle; and the \u201cland that is very far off\u201d is the whole land of Israel, all prosperous and peaceful, as contrasted with the narrow range of view which the people had had during the siege, pent up within the walls of Jerusalem. (Comp. <a class=\"ref\">Genesis 13:14-15<\/a>.) Comp. as to form, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MjEyXQ==\">Isaiah 29:18<\/a>; <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MjM4XQ==\">Isaiah 30:20<\/a>. <\/p> ",
