    "html": " <i>Lord hath made bare his holy arm.<\/i> In ancient times, men prepared for battle by throwing their cloak away from the shoulder of their fighting arm (<a class=\"ref\">Ps. 74:11<\/a>). At the second coming of Christ, God will make bare his arm when he shows forth his power for all to see (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 133:2-3<\/a>). <\/p> <p><i>eyes of all the nations.<\/i> All the world will know of the deliverance of God (40:5).<\/p> <p><i>ends of the earth shall see the salvation.<\/i> Every part of the earth will see and know the power of the Lord; all will see how he delivers those who turn to him. Joseph Smith promised the suffering Saints: \"The days of tribulation are fast approaching, and the time to test the fidelity of the Saints has come&hellip;. but in these times of sore trial, let the Saints be patient and see the salvation of God. Those who cannot endure persecution, and stand in the day of affliction, cannot stand in the day when the Son of God shall burst the veil, and appear in all the glory of His Father, with all the holy angels.\" <\/p> ",
