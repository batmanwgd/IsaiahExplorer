(<i>Melech<\/i> is the Hebrew word for <i>king.<\/i>) Another possible meaning is that the Lord's people dishonored their covenants by seeking security in earthly powers instead of trusting in the Lord (see, for example, <a class=\"ref\">2 Kgs. 16:7<\/a>). <\/p> <p><i>ointment\/perfumes.<\/i> These adornments are used to make oneself more attractive to a lover and symbolize the ways people seek to please false gods.<\/p> <p><i>messengers far off.<\/i> The Israelites looked to the gods of other nations (for ex- ample, the gods of Assyria and Tyre), rather than to their own true God (17:7-8; 30:1-2; <a class=\"ref\">1 Sam. 28:13<\/a>). The messengers may be those who are sent to look for new gods to worship in many places.<\/p> <p><i>debase thyself&hellip;unto hell.<\/i> The Revised Standard Version translates this as \"sent down even to Sheol.\" Not only did apostate Israel send messengers afar seeking false gods but she even looked to the pagan god of Sheol, the underworld (28:14-15). Some today are so far removed from the truth that they seek in \"far places\" for spiritual fulfillment, forgetting the only true source of blessings.<\/p> ",
