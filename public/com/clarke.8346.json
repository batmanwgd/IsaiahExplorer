    "html": "<p><em>A sepulcher on high - in a rock\u2014<\/em>It has been observed before, on Isaiah 14, that persons of high rank in Judea, and in most parts of the east, were generally buried in large sepulchral vaults, hewn out in the rock for the use of themselves and their families. The vanity of Shebna is set forth by his being so studious and careful to have his sepulcher on high - in a lofty vault; and that probably in a high situation, that it might be more conspicuous. Hezekiah was buried, <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05dc\u05de\u05e2\u05dc\u05d4 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">lemalah<\/span>, <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u03b5\u03bd \u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9<\/span>, Sept.: in the chiefest, says our translation; rather, in the highest part of the sepulchres of the sons of David, to do him the more honor,  <a class=\"ref\">2 Chronicles 32:33<\/a>. There are some monuments still remaining in Persia of great antiquity, called Naksi Rustam, which give one a clear idea of Shebna's pompous design for his sepulcher. They consist of several sepulchers, each of them hewn in a high rock near the top; the front of the rock to the valley below is adorned with carved work in relievo, being the outside of the sepulcher. Some of these sepulchers are about thirty feet in the perpendicular from the valley, which is itself perhaps raised above half as much by the accumulation of the earth since they were made. See the description of them in Chardin, Pietro della Valle, Thevenot, and Kempfer. Diodorus Siculus, lib. 17, mentions these ancient monuments, and calls them the sepulchres of the kings of Persia. - L.<\/p>",
