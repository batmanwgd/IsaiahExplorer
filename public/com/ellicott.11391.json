Smith, Sayce, and Cheyne. The etymology of the name, as meaning the \u201ceagle\u201d deity, is also one of the open questions of Assyrian research. <\/p> \n <p>Adrammelech and Sharezer.\u2014The former name appears in that of a deity of Sepharvaim in <a class=\"ref\">2 Kings 17:31<\/a> \u2014its probable meaning being \u201cthe king of glory,\u201d that of Sharezer, \u201cthe ruler preserves,\u201d or, in a variant form, Sanatzu, \u201cSin (the moon-god) preserves.\u201d The Assyrian records, so far as they are yet interpreted, make no mention of the murder, but an inscription of Esar-haddon\u2019s, mutilated at the beginning, begins with an account of his victory over rebel princes, and the narrative of his campaign speaks of snowy mountains, which at least suggest Armenia (Heb. Ararat), (Records of the Past, iii. 101). Armenian traditions make the two parricides the founders of royal houses, the Sasserunians and Aizerunians. From the latter, in which the name of Sennacherib was common, sprang the Byzantine Emperor, Leo the Armenian. Esar-haddon is further memorable as having peopled Samaria with the mixed population of Babylonians, Cutheans, and others (<a class=\"ref\">2 Kings 17:24; Ezra 4:10<\/a>), from whom the later Samaritans were descended\u2014as having taken Zidon and deported its inhabitants (Records of the Past, iv., p. 111)\u2014as having left in scriptions at Nahr-el-kelb, near Beyrout, in which he describes himself as \u201cKing of Egypt, Thebes, and Ethiopia,\u201d as having probably been the \u201cking of Assyria\u201d who carried Manasseh bound in fetters to Babylon. The will of Sennacherib (Records of the Past, i. 136), giving him his chief treasures, and renaming him with a new title of sovereignty (Assur-Ebil-Muni-pal, i.e., \u201cAssur is lord, the establisher of the son \u201c), seems to imply that he was a younger son, whom the fondness of Sennacherib had exalted above his elder brothers, who accordingly revenged themselves by the murder of their father. <\/p> ",
