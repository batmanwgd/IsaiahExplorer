The cedars of Lebanon, and other trees of the forest, are to furnish timber for its buildings, or even to be planted in the courts of the Temple, or in its open places and streets (<a class=\"ref\">Psalms 52:8; Psalms 92:12-13<\/a>; <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTgzMjM=\">Isaiah 35:2<\/a>).<\/p>\n <p>The box is probably, as in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTg0NzE=\">Isaiah 41:19<\/a>, a species of cedar.<\/p>\n <p>The place of my feet is clearly parallel with the \u201csanctuary\u201d of the previous clause. So the word \u201cfootstool\u201d is used of the Temple in <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 99:5; Psalms 132:7<\/a>.<\/p>",
