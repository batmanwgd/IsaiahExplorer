They are great prophets raised up to prophesy and protect the Jewish people during a critical period just prior to the Second Coming.<\/p>     <table>         <tbody>             <tr>                 <td>18 <u>There is<\/u> none to guide her among all the sons <u>whom<\/u> she hath brought forth; neither <u>is there any<\/u> that taketh her by the hand of all the sons <u>that<\/u> she hath brought up.                     <br>                     <br>19 These two <u>things<\/u> are come unto thee<u>;<\/u> who shall be sorry for thee<u>?<\/u> desolation<u>,<\/u> and destruction, and the famine<u>,<\/u> and the sword<u>:<\/u> by whom shall I comfort thee?                     <br>                     <br>20 Thy sons have fainted, they lie at the head of all the streets<u>,<\/u> as a wild bull in a net<u>:<\/u> they are full of the fury of the Lord, the rebuke of thy God.                     <br>                 <\/td>                 <td>18 <u>And<\/u> none to guide her among all the sons she hath brought forth; neither that taketh her by the hand<u>,<\/u> of all the sons she hath brought up.                     <br>                     <br>19 These two <u>sons<\/u> are come unto thee<u>,<\/u> who shall be sorry for thee<u>thy<\/u> desolation and destruction, and the famine and the sword<u>and<\/u> by whom shall I comfort thee?                     <br>                     <br>20 Thy sons have fainted, <u>save these two;<\/u> they lie at the head of all the streets<u>;<\/u> as a wild bull in a net<u>,<\/u> they are full of the fury of the Lord, the rebuke of thy God.                     <br>                 <\/td>             <\/tr>         <\/tbody>     <\/table>",
