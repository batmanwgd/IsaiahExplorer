Paul quoted verse 4 to the Corinthian Saints in an attempt to encourage them to have faith in God. The textual differences in his quotation enlighten our understanding of that verse: \"But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him\" (<a class=\"ref\">1 Cor. 2:9<\/a>).<\/p>     ",
