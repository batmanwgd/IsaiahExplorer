Hence the wicked who experience the day of the Lord will suffer both physical pain and emotional distress.<\/p> <p><i>amazed one at another.<\/i> The New International Version reading is more descriptive: \"They will look aghast at each other,\" because of the terrible happenings.<\/p> <p> <i>faces shall be as flames.<\/i> In the immediate context, this speaks of the bright red shame and guilt that evil persons are experiencing. This may also speak of the Second Coming when the wicked will burn with fire. Meanwhile, the righteous will \"shine forth in the kingdom of God\" (<a class=\"ref\">Alma 40:25; D&amp;C 115:5<\/a>). <\/p> ",
