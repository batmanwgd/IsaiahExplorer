    "html": "<p><i>Hezekiah took the letters. <\/i>The Prophet now shews what kind of refuge Hezekiah had amidst so great calamities. He immediately went into the Temple, to lament before the Lord the calamity which: he could not remove, and to \u201ccast upon him\u201d (<a class=\"ref\">Psalms 55:22<\/a>) his grief and his anxieties.  Nor was this a blind or confused lamentation, but the pious king wished to move God by his tears and complaints to render assistance. We are taught by his example that, when we are sore pressed, there is nothing better than to east our burden into the bosom of God. All other methods of relief will be of no avail, if this single method be wanting. <\/p>\n<p><i>And spread them before Jehovah. <\/i>In \u201cspreading the letters before the Lord,\u201d he does not do this as if the Lord did not know what was contained in the letters, but God allows us to act in this manner towards him in accommodation to our weakness Neither prayers, nor tears, nor complaints make known to God what we need; for he <\/p>\n<p><span>\u201cknows our wants and necessities before we ask anything \nfrom him.\u201d (<\/span><a class=\"ref\">Matthew 6:8<\/a>.) <\/p>\n<p>But here we ought rather to consider what is necessary for us, that is, that God should manifest that he knows the blasphemies of adversaries, and that they who have uttered them will not remain unpunished. The reason and design, therefore, why Hezekiah \u201cspread before the Lord the letters\u201d of the wicked tyrant was this, that he might excite his own earnestness, and inflame his own ardor, in prayer. <\/p>",
