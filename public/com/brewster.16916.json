Thus, if the unrepentant are to be smitten with the rod of the Lord's mouth, they will be punished or disciplined by the decree of his mouth.\" (DCE, 477-78.) The words on His holy breath will condemn the wicked. Certainly the wicked who will be destroyed by fire at the Second Coming will feel the hot impact of these words. (See <a class=\"ref\">1 Nephi 22:23; 2 Nephi 30:10<\/a>.)<\/p>",
