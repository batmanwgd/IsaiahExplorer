It is in turning from wickedness to righteousness that a spiritual dawning may occur (<a class=\"ref\">Job 11:13-17<\/a>), as was promised here to Israel as a people.<\/p> <p><i>thine health shall spring forth speedily.<\/i> The word translated as <i>health<\/i> (or <i>healing,<\/i> in some versions) means the growth of new flesh in the place of the old wound. Those who fast properly will enjoy greater health and healing of spiritual wounds. In addition, the prophets use this figure in speaking of the restoration of Israel to her blessings (30:26; <a class=\"ref\">Jer. 8:22; 30:17<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\"> 33:6<\/a>). <\/p> <p><i>righteousness&hellip;go before thee\/glory of the Lord&hellip;thy rear guard.<\/i> As he did in 52:12, the prophet here refers to the pillar of light that went before the children of Israel during their exodus from Egypt (<a class=\"ref\">Ex. 13:21-22<\/a>). Those who fast in a manner pleasing to the Lord will grow in righteousness and will have the glory of the Lord as a guide, presence, and protector in their lives.<\/p> ",
