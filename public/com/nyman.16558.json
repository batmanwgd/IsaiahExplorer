This claim is supported by <a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 133:66-70<\/a>, which quotes <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODY2NSI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 50:2-3<\/a> and the last sentence of verse 11, suggesting that a change of thought has been inserted between verses 3 and 11. Verses 4 through 10 may have been inserted to show how the Lord was going to redeem the house of Israel through his \"servant\" (restored Israel, as explained in chapter 49). The Book of Mormon reading of verse 4 (2 <a class=\"ref\">1 Ne. 7:4<\/a>) clearly shows that the servant is addressing the house of Israel.<\/p>     ",
