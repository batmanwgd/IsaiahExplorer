    "html": " <p>The Lord has reminded Israel that all his promises will be fulfilled and that Zion will be established. Now the people who \"follow after righteousness\" cry unto the Lord for assurance that he will indeed bring the promised blessings. \"Awake!\" the people cry to the Lord, reminding him of the power he had shown forth in earlier days. He \"wounded the dragon\" and \"dried the sea\" (51:9-10). Just as he helped the children of Israel escape from Egypt through the Red Sea (51:10), they testify, so will he bring the latter-day redeemed ones back to Zion with songs of joy and gladness (51:11).<\/p> <p>The Lord answers by reminding them of the weakness of man, who is \"like unto grass\" (51:12) and of the power of God, who \"stretched forth the heavens\" (51:13). The people of Zion have been fearful of their oppressors (51:13), forgetting that the Lord is God of all the armies (hosts) of heaven (51:15). Zion is \"my people,\" and the Lord will care for them (51:16).<\/p> <blockquote> <i>Awake, awake!<\/i> Put on <u>strength<\/u>,     <br>O <u>arm of the Lord<\/u>; <i>awake,<\/i>     <br>as in the ancient days&hellip;.     <br><i>Art thou not <\/i>[<i>he<\/i>] that hath <i><u>cut Rahab<\/u>, and <u>wounded the dragon<\/u>?
