Now they must endure the hardships of that evil time as a consequence of wickedness until their iniquities are purged. Still, those who love all of God&rsquo;s children loathe to see others suffer and are profoundly moved at Moab&rsquo;s belated penitence (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc5NjMiOjJ9XQ==\">Isaiah 15:2-3<\/a>). They know that Jehovah readily hears those who love him, whose hearts are right with him: &ldquo;O people of Zion, O inhabitants of Jerusalem, you shall have no cause to weep. He will graciously respond at the cry of your voice; he will answer you as soon as he hears it&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgyMzciOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 30:19<\/a>).<\/p>",
