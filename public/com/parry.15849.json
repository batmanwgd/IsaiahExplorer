As President Spencer W. Kimball put it, \"Sin [is] like handcuffs on the wrists, a ring in the nose, and slave bands around the neck.\" The <i>bands of wickedness<\/i> may also refer to the bonds of slavery and oppression discussed below.<\/p> <p><i>undo the heavy burdens.<\/i> These burdens might be those a master would place on a servant, or they could refer to the emotional burdens people carry.<\/p> <p> <i>let the oppressed go free.<\/i> People were oppressed under slavery or other forms of servitude. For instance, it was the practice in ancient times to take the property of the poor\u2014even the clothes from their backs\u2014as collateral for a debt. With no property, including clothing, the poor had no option but to stay in the servitude of their creditor (<a class=\"ref\">Job 22:6<\/a>). The Lord urges mercy (<a class=\"ref\">Ezek. 18:7,  16<\/a>), even to a removal of the debt (<a class=\"ref\">Deut. 24:12-13; Ex. 22:25-26<\/a>). <\/p> <p><i>break every yoke.<\/i> Yokes are used to control beasts of burden to keep them in a straight path of servitude. The mentality and practice of using other human beings in this manner must be broken. Also, the bondage of sin is a yoke to the soul that fasting can help to break.<\/p> ",
