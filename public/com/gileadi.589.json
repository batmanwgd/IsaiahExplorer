    "html": " <p>Jehovah appeals to &ldquo;my people&rdquo; or &ldquo;my nation&rdquo;&mdash;to his covenant people now scattered among the nations of the world&mdash;to pay attention to what he is doing. His &ldquo;precepts&rdquo; and &ldquo;law&rdquo; or teachings go forth as a light &ldquo;from me.&rdquo; That is, not from men or their religions but through his servant, who&mdash;like Moses (<a class=\"ref\">Exodus 24:12; Deuteronomy 4:44 <\/a>)&mdash;serves as Jehovah&rsquo;s lawgiver (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDg1LDE4NTAyLDE4NzQ1XQ==\">Isaiah 42:4, 21; 55:4 <\/a>) and who personifies Jehovah&rsquo;s <em>righteousness <\/em> and <em>light <\/em> (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDU0LDE4NDg3LDE4NTgxLDE4NjQzXQ==\">Isaiah 41:2; 42:6; 45:19; 49:6 <\/a>). While the wicked may reject the servant, with his coming the fate of nations and peoples hangs in the balance. <\/p> <p>As a forerunner to Jehovah&rsquo;s coming, the servant is one of two &ldquo;arms&rdquo; of God&mdash;the <em>arm <\/em> of <em>righteousness <\/em> (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODI0OF0seyIxODQzMSI6Mn0seyIxODYyOSI6Mn0sWzE4NzA3XV0=\">Isaiah 30:30; 40:10-11; 48:14-15; 52:10 <\/a>)&mdash;the other being Jehovah, the <em>arm <\/em> of <em>salvation <\/em> (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MjgyLDE4ODE3LDE4ODcyXQ==\">Isaiah 33:2; 59:16; 63:5 <\/a>). The <em>arms <\/em> metaphor denotes divine intervention. That takes place: (1) through his servant, who restores justice in the earth among all nations and isles to prepare them for Jehovah&rsquo;s coming (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgyNzYiOjJ9LHsiMTg0NTMiOjJ9LHsiMTg0ODIiOjR9LFsxODc1NV0seyIxODg2MyI6Mn1d\">Isaiah 32:16-17; 41:1-2; 42:1-4; 56:1; 62:8-9 <\/a>); and (2) through Jehovah&rsquo;s himself, his judgment of the wicked and deliverance of the righteous (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODMyNV0seyIxODgxNyI6NX0seyIxODg2OCI6Nn0seyIxODkzMyI6N31d\">Isaiah 35:4; 59:16-20; 63:1-6; 66:10-16 <\/a>). <\/p> ",
