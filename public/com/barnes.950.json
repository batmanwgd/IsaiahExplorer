    "html": "<p><em>I will send him<\/em>&mdash;Implying that he was entirely in the hand of God, and subject to his direction; and showing that God has control over kings and conqueror&rsquo;s; <a class=\"ref\">Proverbs 21:1<\/a>.<\/p><p><em>Against an hypocritical nation<\/em>&mdash;Whether the prophet here refers to Ephraim, or to Judah, or to the Jewish people in general, has been an object of inquiry among interpreters. As the designs of Sennacherib were mainly against Judah. it is probable that that part of the nation was intended. This is evidently the case, if, as has been supposed, the prophecy was uttered after the captivity of the ten tribes; see <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODcxXQ==\">Isaiah 10:20<\/a>. It need scarcely be remarked, that it was eminently the characteristic of the nation that they were hypocritical; compare <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODQ3XQ==\">Isaiah 9:17<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\">Matthew 15:17; Mark 7:6<\/a>.<\/p><p><em>And against the people of my wrath<\/em>&mdash;That is, those who were the objects of my wrath; or the people on whom I am about to pour out my indignation.<\/p><p><em>To take the spoil<\/em>&mdash;To plunder them.<\/p><p><em>And to tread them down<\/em>&mdash;Hebrew, &lsquo;And to make them a treading down.&rsquo; The expression is drawn from war, where the vanquished and the slain are trodden down by the horses of the conquering army. It means here, that the Assyrian would humble and subdue the people; that he would trample indignantly on the nation, regarding them with contempt, and no more to be esteemed than the mire of the streets. A similar figure occurs in <a class=\"ref\">Zechariah 10:5<\/a>: &lsquo;And they shall be as mighty men which tread down their enemies in the mire of the streets in battle.&rsquo;<\/p> ",
