    "html": " <i>Wilt thou refrain thyself for these things?<\/i> Isaiah asks the Lord whether after all the destruction and trouble our enemies have brought on us, he will hold back in avenging our loss and in restoring us.<\/p> <p><i>hold thy peace, and afflict us.<\/i> \"You hold yourself back? Will you keep silent and punish us beyond measure?\" (NIV). Now that the people acknowledge their unworthiness before him and seek his face, now that they and their land are in the direst of circumstances, will he still withhold his help and allow them to suffer more? Or will he reveal himself and come to their aid? According to the <i>Interpreter's Bible,<\/i> \"This is an argument from man at his tenderest to the most loving God. It is the plea of heartbroken sinners to&hellip;a heartbroken God. Calvin, who shared their feeling of the inward filthiness, the total ruination, and the iron slavery of sin, [offers the] prayer: 'Lord, let the bottomless depth of thy mercy swallow up the bottomless depth of my sin.'\" <\/p> ",
