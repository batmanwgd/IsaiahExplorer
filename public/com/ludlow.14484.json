    "html": "<p>In this first chapter of Isaiah to be quoted in the Book of Mormon, the Lord invites rebellious Israel to establish a new beginning as a covenant people. It provides a doctrinal framework for all people who desire to commit (or recommit) to a righteous course of action. Moses, who centuries earlier had prepared the children of Israel as a covenant people, first established this covenant framework. The Lord&rsquo;s original covenant contract with the house of Israel is found in the book of Deuteronomy, where Moses addresses a new generation of Israelites ready to enter their promised land under Joshua&rsquo;s leadership around 1250 b.c. Almost six centuries later, near 700 b.c., Isaiah speaks to the humble citizens of Judah who, through divine intervention, have barely survived a major Assyrian attack (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 36&ndash;37<\/a>). The prophet highlights important conditions for the citizens of Judah who want to remain God&rsquo;s holy people. Many listeners were refugees from the northern tribes and were new inhabitants in Judah, which was rebuilding after the Assyrian invasion. Included among the many refugees from the tribes of Manasseh and Ephraim were probably the ancestors of Lehi and Ishmael, the patriarchs of the later Book of Mormon community. More than a century after Isaiah delivered this sermon, Nephi quoted it in its entirety to teach his family, newly arrived in their promised land, about their new opportunity to become a faithful, covenant people.<\/p>",
