The <i>beloved, <\/i>to whom the prophet addresses the song, is the Lord of the vineyard, as appears by the latter clause of the verse, namely, God, or his Messiah, whom the prophet loved and served, and for whose glory, eclipsed by the barrenness of the vineyard, he was greatly concerned: <i>a song of my beloved <\/i>\u2014 Not devised by me, but inspired by God, which, therefore, it behooveth you to lay deeply to heart: <i>touching his vineyard <\/i>\u2014 The house of Israel, (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzQ3XQ==\">Isaiah 5:7<\/a>,) or his church among the Israelites, often, and very properly, called a vineyard, because of God\u2019s singular regard to it, and care and cultivation of it; his delight in it, and expectation of good fruit from it. <i>My beloved hath, <\/i>&c. \u2014 Hebrew,  <span class=\"hebrew_text\">\u05dc\u05d9\u05d3\u05d9\u05d3\u05d9 \u05d4\u05d9\u05d4 \u05db\u05e8\u05dd<\/span>, <i>my beloved hath had a vineyard, <\/i>namely, for many ages, with which he hath long taken great pains, and on which he hath bestowed much culture; <i>in a very fruitful hill <\/i>\u2014 Hebrew, <i>on a horn, the son of oil, <\/i>\u201can expression,\u201d says Bishop Lowth, \u201chighly descriptive and poetical.\u201d According to Kimchi the prophet gives the land of Israel this appellation because of its height and fertility. Accordingly, the bishop renders the phrase, <i>on a high and fruitful hill, <\/i>observing, that \u201cthe parts of animals are, by an easy metaphor, applied to parts of the earth, both in common and poetical language. A promontory is called <i>a cape, <\/i>or <i>head; <\/i>the Turks call it <i>a nose; <\/i>a ridge of rocks, <i>a back, <\/i>(<i>\u2018dorsum immane mari summo, <\/i>a huge <i>back <\/i>in the deep sea;\u2019 Virg.) Thus <i>a horn <\/i>is a proper and obvious image for a mountain, or mountainous country.\u201d Hills are places most commodious for vines, and the hills of Canaan being very fertile, the phrase, <i>son of oil, <\/i>is added to express that circumstance, both because oil includes the idea of fatness, and because <i>oil-olive <\/i>was one of the most valued productions of that land. Indeed the word <i>horn <\/i>also is frequently used in Scripture as an emblem of plenty, their wealth consisting very much in their <i>herds, <\/i>as well as flocks.<\/p>",
