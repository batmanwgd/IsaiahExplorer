    "html": "<p><em>Yea, ten acres<\/em>&mdash;In this verse a reason is rendered why the houses mentioned in the previous verse should become desolate. The reason is, that the land would become sterile and barren, as a divine judgment for their oppression. To what particular time the prophet refers, here, is not apparent. It is certain, however, that the land of Canaan was frequently given up to sterility. The withholding of the early and latter rains, or the neglect of cultivation from any cause, would produce this. At present, this formerly fertile country is among the most unproductive on the face of the earth.<\/p><p><em>Ten acres<\/em>&mdash;An &ldquo;acre,&rdquo; among the Hebrews, was what could be plowed by one yoke of oxen in a day. It did not differ materially from our acre.<\/p><p><em>Shall yield one bath<\/em>&mdash;One bath of wine. The &ldquo;bath&rdquo; was a Jewish measure for liquids, containing about seven gallons and a half. To say that &ldquo;ten acres&rdquo; should produce no more wine than this; was the same as to say that it would produce almost nothing.<\/p><p><em>And the seed of an homer<\/em>&mdash;An &ldquo;homer&rdquo; was a Hebrew measure for grain, containing about eight bushels.<\/p><p><em>An ephah<\/em>&mdash;The &ldquo;ephah&rdquo; contained about three pecks. Of course, to say that an homer of seed should produce about three pecks, would be the same as saying that it would produce almost nothing.<\/p>",
