Were those who strove, the heathen nations who resisted Cyrus, or Israelites who desired some other deliverer, say a prince of the house of David? The latter seems more probable. In either case men were guilty of the folly of criticising the Almighty.<\/p> \n<p>Let the potsherd strive . . .\u2014The sentence, as the italics show, is abrupt, but is better taken without inserting the verbs, and in apposition with the pronoun\u2014Woe unto him . . . a potsherd among the potsherds; a frail mortal like all his fellows.<\/p> \n<p>Shall the clay say . . .\u2014The potsherd suggests the potter, not without an allusive reference to the history of man\u2019s creation in<a class=\"ref\">Genesis 2:7<\/a> . As in<a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 18:1-10; Romans 9:20-21<\/a> , the thought pressed is that of absolute sovereignty, the belief in the wisdom and equity of that sovereignty being kept in the background, as a reserve force. The two clauses represent different aspects of presumption\u2014the first questions, the other arrogantly condemns.
