It is an allusion to an ambassador who returns without despatching the business for which he was sent. <i>It shall accomplish that which I please <\/i>\u2014 It shall have the desired effect; <i>and it shall prosper, <\/i>&c. \u2014 It shall certainly be fulfilled in the manner before expressed.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 55:12-13<\/a><i>For, <\/i>or <i>therefore: you shall go out with joy <\/i>\u2014 Ye shall be released from your bondage, because God hath promised, and will effect it. He alludes to their going out of Egypt, or to their release from Babylon, which deliverances were emblematical of the redemption of mankind, by Christ, from the power of sin and Satan. <i>And be led forth <\/i>\u2014 Or <i>led onward, <\/i>as Bishop Lowth renders  <span class=\"hebrew_text\">\u05ea\u05d5\u05d1\u05dc\u05d5\u05df<\/span>, be conducted by the gracious and powerful presence of God, as the Israelites were in the wilderness; <i>in<\/i> <i>peace <\/i>\u2014 Safely and triumphantly, without fear of being retaken and brought back into slavery by your enemies. <i>The mountains and the hills shall break forth, <\/i>&c. \u2014 There shall be a great and general rejoicing at your deliverance. For \u201cthese are highly poetical images, to express a happy state, attended with joy and exultation.\u201d <i>Instead of the thorn shall come up the fir-tree <\/i>\u2014 \u201cThese likewise are general poetical images, expressing a great and happy change for the better: the wilderness turned into a paradise, Lebanon into Carmel; the desert of the Gentiles watered with the heavenly snow and rain, which fail not to have their due effect, and becoming fruitful in piety and righteousness: or, as the Chaldee gives the moral sense of the emblem, \u2018instead of the wicked shall arise the just, and instead of sinners, such as fear to sin.\u2019\u201d \u2014 Bishop Lowth. In other words, The church shall be delivered from pernicious men and things, and replenished with sincere and serious believers, and with all sorts of divine graces and blessings. <i>And it shall be to the Lord for a name <\/i>\u2014 This wonderful change shall bring much honour to that God by whom it is wrought. <i>For an everlasting sign <\/i>\u2014 For a monument, or evident and glorious token of God\u2019s infinite power, faithfulness, and love to his people, unto all succeeding generations; <i>that shall not be cut off <\/i>\u2014 Which shall never be abolished, but shall always live and flourish in the minds and mouths of men. <\/p>",
