His grave's being with the rich is a prophecy of his being buried in the tomb of the rich man Joseph of Arimathea (see <a class=\"ref\">Matt. 27:57-60; Mark 15:42-46; Luke 23:50-53; John 19:38-42<\/a>).<\/p>     <p>Isaiah said the Savior would be so buried or killed because he had done no violence. The Book of Mormon retains the word \"evil\" instead of \"violence\" <i>(see<\/i> Mosiah <i>14:9). Peter<\/i> quoted this part of the verse as follows: \"... who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth\" (<a class=\"ref\">1 Pet. 2:22<\/a>). This seems to be a prophecy of Pilate's finding no fault in him (see Matthew <i>27:22-24;<\/i> Mark <i>15:14-15;<\/i> <a class=\"ref\">Luke 23:1-4, 13-24; John 18:38<\/a>). The statement that there was no <i>deceit<\/i> in his mouth may have reference to Jesus' statement before Pilate that he came to \"bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth <i>heareth<\/i> my voice.\" To this testimony Pilate responded, \"What is truth?\" He then went out again to <i>the<\/i> Jews and declared that he found no fault in the man (see <a class=\"ref\">John 18:37-38<\/a>).<\/p>     ",
