Similarly, Ezekiel wrote that \"the Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon with fair branches, and with a shadowing shroud, and of an high stature; and his top was among the thick boughs\" (<a class=\"ref\">Ezek. 31:3<\/a>). Jehovah, the forester, chops down the tree with an ax.<\/p> <p><i>high ones of stature shall be hewn down.<\/i> The forester will also cut down Assyria's proud and haughty people.<\/p> ",
