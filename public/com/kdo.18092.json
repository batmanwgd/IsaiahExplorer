    "html": "<p> What follows in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NTc3XQ==\">Isaiah 45:15<\/a> is not a continuation of the words of the Gentiles, but a response of the church to their confession. The nations that have been idolatrous till now, bend in humble spontaneous worship before the church and its God; and at the sight of this, the church, from whose soul the prophet is speaking, bursts out into an exclamation of reverential amazement. <em> \u201cVerily Thou art a mysterious God, Thou God of Israel, Thou Savour.\u201d<\/em> Literally, a God who hides Himself (<em> mistatte\u0304r <\/em> : the resemblance to \u03bc \u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03c1-\u03b9\u03c9\u0301\u03b4\u03b7\u03c2 is quite an accidental one; the <em> e\u0304 <\/em> is retained in the participle even in pause). The meaning is, a God who guides with marvellous strangeness the history of the nations of the earth, and by secret ways, which human eyes can never discern, conducts all to a glorious issue. The exclamation in <a class=\"ref\">Romans 11:33<\/a>, \u201cO the depth of the riches,\u201d etc., is a similar one.<\/p>",
