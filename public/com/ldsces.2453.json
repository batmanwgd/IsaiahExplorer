    "html": "<p>When people do evil in the Lord&rsquo;s sight, their ways can be compared to &ldquo;filthy rags.&rdquo; &ldquo;We are all as an unclean thing&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODkyXQ==\">Isaiah 64:6<\/a>). God then hides His face from such individuals (see <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODkzXQ==\">v. 7<\/a>), and they must repent and plead to be forgiven (see <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODg5NF0seyIxNzgzMSI6MjF9XQ==\">vv. 8&ndash;9<\/a>). Isaiah said that &ldquo;all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags,&rdquo; or as Keil and Delitzsch translated the passage: <em>&ldquo;All our virtues [are] like a garment soiled with blood&rdquo;<\/em> (<em>Commentary,<\/em> 7:2:470). That is not to say that God despises virtue and views it as filthiness, but rather to say that Israel&rsquo;s <em>former<\/em> righteousness has now become evil. Joseph Smith changed <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODg5MV0seyIxNzc3MSI6MTN9XQ==\">Isaiah 64:5&ndash;6<\/a>to reflect this teaching more clearly: &ldquo;Thou meetest him that worketh righteousness, and rejoiceth him that remembereth thee in thy ways; in righteousness there is continuance, and such shall be saved. But we have sinned; we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.&rdquo; (<a class=\"ref\">JST, Isaiah 64:5&ndash;6<\/a>.)<\/p><p class=\"cite\">LDS Church Educational System Old Testament Student Manual, 1 Kings&ndash;Malachi, Religion 302, Chapter 18, Item 25<\/p>",
