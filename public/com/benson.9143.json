In excessive grief, the bowels are sometimes rolled together, so as to make an audible noise. Hereby he signifies the greatness of their approaching calamity, which, being so grievous to him, must needs be intolerable to them.<i> And when it is seen that Moab is weary,<\/i> &c. \u2014 When it shall appear to them and others, that all their other devotions are vain and ineffectual;<i> he shall come to his sanctuary to pray<\/i> \u2014 To the temple of his great god Chemosh;<i> but he shall not prevail<\/i> \u2014 His god can neither hear nor help him. In other words, the Moabites, \u201cas their last efforts, shall go to their altars, there to perform their sacred rites to appease the anger of their deity: but, wearied herewith, they shall enter into some more sacred and celebrated sanctuary of their god, to pour forth their earnest supplications and prayers, but shall obtain nothing; thus proving the vanity of their superstition, and the imbecility of those false deities on whom they trusted.\u201d<\/p> ",
