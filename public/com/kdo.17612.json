    "html": "<p> In <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3Njc4XQ==\">Isaiah 1:23<\/a> the prophet says this without a figure: <em> \u201cThy rulers are rebellious, and companions of thieves; every one loveth presents, and hunteth after payment; the orphan they right not, and the cause of the widow has no access to them.\u201d<\/em> In two words the prophet depicts the contemptible baseness of the national rulers (<em> sa\u0302rim <\/em> ). He describes first of all their baseness in relation to God, with the alliterative <em> sorerim <\/em> : <em> rebellious<\/em> , refractory; and then, in relation to men, <em> companions<\/em> of thieves, inasmuch as they allowed themselves to be bribed by presents of stolen goods to acts of injustice towards those who had been robbed. They not only willingly accepted such bribes, and that not merely a few of them, but every individual belonging to the rank of princes (<em> Cullo <\/em> , equivalent to <em> haccol <\/em> , the whole: every one <em> loveth<\/em> gifts); but they went eagerly in pursuit of them (<em> rodeph <\/em> ). It was not peace (<em> sha\u0302lom <\/em> ) that they hunted after (<a class=\"ref\">Psalms 34:16<\/a>), but <em> shalmonim <\/em> shalmonim, things that would pacify their avarice; not what was good, but compensation for their partiality. - This was the existing state of Jerusalem, and therefore it would hardly be likely to take the way of mercy opened before it in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NjczXQ==\">Isaiah 1:18<\/a>; consequently Jehovah would avail himself of other means of setting it right.<\/p>",
