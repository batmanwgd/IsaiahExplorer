    "html": " <p>The use of this phrase has puzzled many commentators. Specific countries have received the burden, yet no known country is named. Keil and Delitzsch believed Isaiah used a symbolic name, and they believe it alluded to Babylon. That city sat on a hot and dusty plain in the Euphrates valley, but anciently, before flood control dams were built, the whole plain was flooded each spring during the high water runoff of the Euphrates. Thus, Babylon sat both in a desert and on a sea. (see <em>Commentary, <\/em> 7:1:377.) This interpretation seems to be supported by Jeremiah&rsquo;s description of Babylon as she that &ldquo;dwellest upon many waters&rdquo; (<a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 51:13<\/a>) and his promise that her waters would be &ldquo;dried up&rdquo; (<a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 50:38<\/a>). <\/p> <p>Spiritually or symbolically, John described Babylon as sitting upon many waters. He then explained that the waters represent the nations and peoples of the earth. (see <a class=\"ref\">Revelation 17:1, 15<\/a>.) If Isaiah used the same concept, then the sea would represent Babylon&rsquo;s dominion and the desert, the coming loss of those dominions. <\/p> <p class=\"cite\"> LDS Church Educational System Old Testament Student Manual, 1 Kings&ndash;Malachi, Religion 302, Chapter 14, Item 33 <\/p> ",
