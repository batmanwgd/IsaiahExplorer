Every verse in the Book of Mormon reads differently from the way it reads in the King James text, and many of the differences are significant. It can be assumed that the Book of Mormon text is more correct than the King James Version because Nephi lived just a little more than one hundred years after Isaiah&rsquo;s time and most likely possessed a purer text than the one the King James translators worked from. Carefully compare verses 1&ndash;2, 6&ndash;7, 11, 14, 16&ndash;17, and 22 in both versions to see the significant changes. <\/p> <p class=\"cite\"> LDS Church Educational System Old Testament Student Manual, 1 Kings&ndash;Malachi, Religion 302, Chapter 17, Item 2 <\/p> ",
