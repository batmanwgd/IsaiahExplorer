During the earth&rsquo;s millennial age of peace, Jehovah sends emissaries to those who survive his Day of Judgment so that they may likewise receive the chance to see his glory: &ldquo;I will come to gather all nations and tongues, that they may approach and behold my glory&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4OTQxXQ==\">Isaiah 66:18 <\/a>). <\/p> ",
