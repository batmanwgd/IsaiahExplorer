    "html": " <p> Isaiah contrasts the greatness of the Lord with the nothingness of mankind. The Lord has power to create the heavens (40:12), possesses all knowledge, wisdom, and understanding, and no man can instruct him (40:14); he is greater than all his creations and has no equal (40:20). When contrasted with God, the nations of the earth are as insignificant as a single drop of water in a bucket, a few particles of dust (40:15-17), or small grasshoppers. Even the great princes and judges of the earth are nothing (40:23) compared to God, who has power to add to his creations as easily as a person opens the curtains in his home (40:22). Isaiah uses ten rhetorical questions as a teaching tool in this section; five of them begin with the words <i>who<\/i> or <i>whom. <\/i><\/p> <blockquote>Who hath <i>measured the waters<\/i> [of the sea] <u>in the hollow of his hand<\/u><i>,<\/i>     <br>and <i>meted out heaven<\/i> with <u>the span<\/u><i>,<\/i>     <br>and <i>comprehended the dust<\/i> of the earth in <u>a measure<\/u><i>,<\/i>     <br>and <i>weighed the mountains<\/i> <u>in scales<\/u><i>,<\/i>     <br>and <i>the hills<\/i> <u>in a balance<\/u>? (40:12)     <br>Who hath <i>directed<\/i> the <u>Spirit<\/u> of the Lord,     <br>or being his counselor hath <i>taught<\/i> <u>him<\/u>? (40:13)     <br><i>With whom<\/i> took he <u>counsel<\/u><i>,<\/i>     <br><i>and who<\/i> <u>instructed<\/u> him,     <br>and <i>taught<\/i> him in the path of <u>judgment<\/u><i>,<\/i>     <br>and <i>taught<\/i> him <u>knowledge<\/u><i>,<\/i>     <br>and [<i>showed<\/i>] to him the way of <u>understanding<\/u>? (40:14)     <br>Behold, the <i>nations<\/i> are as a <u>drop of a bucket<\/u><i>,<\/i>     <br>and are counted as the small <u>dust of the balance<\/u>:     <br>behold, he taketh up the <i>isles<\/i> as a <u>very little thing<\/u><i>.<\/i> (40:15)     <br>And <i>Lebanon<\/i> is not sufficient to <u>burn<\/u><i>,<\/i>     <br>nor <i>the beasts thereof<\/i> sufficient for a <u>burnt offering<\/u><i>.<\/i> (40:16)     <br>All <i>nations<\/i> before him are as <u>nothing<\/u>;     <br>and <i>they<\/i> are counted to him <u>less than nothing<\/u><i>,<\/i> and vanity. (40:17)     <br>To whom then will ye <i>liken<\/i> <u>God<\/u>?     <br>or what <i>likeness<\/i> will ye <i>compare<\/i> <i>unto <\/i><u>him<\/u>? (40:18)     <br>The <i>workman<\/i> melteth a <u>graven image<\/u><i>,<\/i>     <br>and the <i>goldsmith<\/i> spreadeth it over with <u>gold<\/u><i>,<\/i> and casteth <u>silver chains<\/u><i>.<\/i> (40:19)     <br>He that is so impoverished that he hath no oblation <i>chooseth a tree<\/i> <u>that will not rot<\/u>;     <br>he seeketh unto him a cunning workman to prepare a <i>graven image,<\/i> <u>that shall not be moved<\/u><i>.<\/i> (40:20)     <br>Have <i>ye<\/i> not <u>known<\/u>?     <br>have <i>ye<\/i> not <u>heard<\/u>?     <br>hath it not been <u>told<\/u> <i>you<\/i> from the beginning?     <br>have <i>ye<\/i> not <u>understood<\/u> from the foundations of the earth? (40:21)     <br>It is he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth,     <br>and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers;     <br>that <i>stretcheth out<\/i> the heavens as a <u>curtain<\/u><i>,<\/i>     <br>and <i>spreadeth<\/i> them out as a <u>tent<\/u> to dwell in: (40:22)     <br>That <i>bringeth<\/i> the <u>princes to nothing<\/u>;     <br>he <i>maketh<\/i> the <u> judges of the earth as vanity<\/u><i>.<\/i> (40:23)     <br>Yea, <i>they<\/i> shall <u>not be planted<\/u>;     <br>yea, <i>they<\/i> shall <u>not be sown<\/u>:     <br>yea, <i>their<\/i> stock shall <u>not take root<\/u> in the earth:     <br>and he shall also <i>blow upon them,<\/i> and they shall <u>wither<\/u><i>,<\/i>     <br>and the <i>whirlwind<\/i> shall take them away as <u>stubble<\/u><i>.<\/i> (40:24)     <br>To whom then will ye <i>liken <\/i>me, or shall I <i>be equal?<\/i> saith the Holy One.
