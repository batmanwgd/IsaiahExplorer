See the like phrase, <a class=\"ref\">Ezekiel 3:8-9<\/a>. which Bishop Lowth translates as follows: \u201cBehold I have made thy face strong against their faces, and thy forehead strong against their foreheads: as an adamant, harder than a rock, have I made thy forehead.\u201d The expression, however, sometimes signifies <i>obstinacy <\/i>and <i>impudence, <\/i>as <a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 5:3; Zechariah 7:12<\/a>; but here a settled and immoveable purpose to persevere in well-doing. <i>He is near that justifieth me <\/i>\u2014<\/p>\n<p>Though God seems to be at a distance, and to hide his face from me; yet he is, in truth, at my right hand, ready to help me, and will publicly acquit me from all the calumnies of mine adversaries; will clear up my righteousness, and show, by many and mighty signs and wonders, that I lived and died his faithful servant. <i>Who is mine adversary? Let him come near to me <\/i>\u2014 I challenge all my accusers to stand and appear before the Judge, and to produce all their charges against me: for I am conscious of mine own innocence, and I know that God will give sentence for me. <i>Who is he that shall condemn me? <\/i>\u2014 That dare attempt, or can justly do it? <i>Lo, they all<\/i> \u2014<i> <\/i>Mine accusers and enemies; <i>shall wax old as a garment <\/i>\u2014 Shall pine away in their iniquity: <i>the moth shall eat them up <\/i>\u2014 They shall be cut off and consumed, by a secret curse and judgment of God, compared to a moth, <a class=\"ref\">Hosea 5:12<\/a>.<\/p>",
