The wicked will cry out \"to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us.\" (<a class=\"ref\">Luke 23:30<\/a>.) John the Revelator saw this occurrence as one of the signs of the last days. (<a class=\"ref\">Revelation 6:15-16<\/a>.) However, there is no rock large enough, or pit deep enough, to hide them from the Lord. (See <a class=\"ref\">Amos 9:3<\/a>.)<\/p>     <p>So it is with so-called \"secret sins\"; they are not hidden from God. One either properly repents of them in this life or faces an ultimate day where they will be revealed. The Lord has given fair warning: \"And the rebellious shall be pierced with much sorrow; for their iniquities shall be spoken upon the housetops, and their secret acts shall be revealed.\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 1:3<\/a>; see also <a class=\"ref\">2 Nephi 30:17<\/a>.)<\/p>",
