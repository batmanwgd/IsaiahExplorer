    "html": "<p> This is the origin of a metal idol. The wooden idol is described in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDQxXQ==\">Isaiah 40:20<\/a> : <em> \u201cThe man who is impoverished in oblations, he chooseth a block of wood that will not rot; he seeketh for himself a skilful smith, to prepare an idol that will not shake.\u201d<\/em> He who has fallen into such poverty that he can only offer to his God a poor oblation (<em> t e ru\u0304ma\u0302h <\/em> , accusative, according to Ewald, \u00a7284,<em> c<\/em> ), has an idol cut for himself out of a block of wood. That <em> sa\u0302khan <\/em> (Arab. <em> sakana <\/em> or <em> sakuna <\/em> )<\/p><p> (Note: Both forms occur in this sense, according to the evidence of original sources, with the common imperative <em> yaskunu <\/em> , the infinitive <em> suku\u0304ne <\/em> passed over by Freytag, the verbal substantive <em> m askane <\/em> , and the adjective <em> m iskin <\/em> or <em> m eskin <\/em> , primarily to be forced to inactivity through weakness, destitution, or outward influences, not to be able to move and exert one's self; or, more particularly, not to be able to defend one's self (as it were to be obliged to sit still or keep still). Hence more especially <em> opibus et facultatibus carens <\/em> , being in distress, destitute, poor.)<\/p><p> is an ancient word, is evident from <a class=\"ref\">Deuteronomy 8:9<\/a>. The verb <em> yimmo\u0304t <\/em> , like <em> yitto\u0304l <\/em> in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDM2XQ==\">Isaiah 40:15<\/a>, is a fut. <em> niphal<\/em> , to be made to shake. A wooden image, which is planed at the bottom, and made heavier below than above, to prevent its falling over with every shock, is to be a god! The thing carries its own satire, even when described with the greatest seriousness.<\/p>",
