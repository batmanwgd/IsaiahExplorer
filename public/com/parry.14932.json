    "html": " <i>I will bring the Assyrian in my land.<\/i> The fulfillment of this prophecy is chronicled in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isa. 36<\/a> when the Assyrians enter Palestine.<\/p> <p><i>upon my mountains tread him under foot.<\/i> God's mountains are the Judean mountains in Palestine, the hill country that extends north and south some thirty-five miles and is approximately fifteen miles wide. After the Assyrians have fulfilled the Lord's purposes, he will trample on them as if they were dust.<\/p> <p><i>then shall his yoke depart from off them.<\/i> This phrase recalls 10:27, wherein the Lord promises the Israelites that the Assyrian \"yoke shall be destroyed.\" The Assyrian burden was removed from Israel a few years after the prophecy was given. Symbolically, the yoke of Assyria (the world) is removed from covenant Israel as they accept Jesus Christ and forsake their sins.<\/p> ",
