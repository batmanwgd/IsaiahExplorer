It seems to have been inserted a second time in the Hebrew text by mistake.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>I reckoned till morning, etc. \"I roared until the morning like the lion\"\u2014<\/em>For <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05e9\u05d5\u05d9\u05ea\u05d9 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">shivvithi<\/span>, the Chaldee has <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05e0\u05d4\u05de\u05d9\u05ea <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">nihameith<\/span> : he read <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05e9\u05d0\u05d2\u05ea\u05d9 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">shaagti<\/span>, the proper term for the roaring of a lion; often applied to the deep groaning of men in sickness. See Psalm 22,  <a class=\"ref\">Psalm 32:3;  Psalm 38:9;  Job 3:24<\/a>. The Masoretes divide the sentence, as I have done; taking <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05db\u05d0\u05e8\u05d9 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">caari<\/span>, like a lion, into the first member; and so likewise the Septuagint.<\/p>",
