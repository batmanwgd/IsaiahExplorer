Egypt&rsquo;s emissaries and messengers hastily attempt to forestall what portends to be an invasion of Egypt, the world&rsquo;s great superpower. Aggressive and militant, Assyria is &ldquo;dreaded far and wide&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODE3LDE4MDM2LDE4Njg3XQ==\">Isaiah 8:9; 20:6; 51:13<\/a>). As it has done to other nations&mdash;annexing their lands&mdash;so it threatens its rival world power that suffers from internal weakness and decline (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODAxOCI6M30=\">Isaiah 19:13-15<\/a>).<\/p>",
