    "html": "               <p>T<small>HERE CAN BE NO<\/small> question of the focus of chapter 24: the destruction of the \u201cearth.\u201d The word \u201cearth\u201d occurs no less than sixteen times in these twenty-three verses. Nor is there any question as to who will bring this destruction about: the Lord (24:1, 3, 21). Verses 1\u20133 underline the universal nature of this judgment. Everyone will be subject to it, and no one will be exempt. This is established in verse 2 with the use of complimentary pairs, such as \u201cpriest\u201d and \u201cpeople\u201d or \u201cmistress\u201d and \u201cmaid.\u201d Neither gender, nor rank, nor function will permit any to escape what God is bringing on the earth.<\/p>     <p>\u2003But why is this destruction coming? Is it the result of divine pique or the need to demonstrate divine power? Neither. Instead, it is the result of the choices that earth\u2019s inhabitants have made. Verses 4\u201313 use one of the common images of this early part of the book to make this statement: the vine (cf. 5:1\u20137; 16:8\u201310; 27:2\u20136). The earth \u201cdries up\u201d and \u201cwithers\u201d (24:4) like a vine (24:7). All the merry-making associated with the wine harvest and the making of the first new wine is stilled. Why? Because earth\u2019s inhabitants have \u201cdisobeyed the laws\u201d of life. They have \u201cbroken the everlasting covenant\u201d (24:5).<\/p>     <p>\u2003At first glance this language seems strange. References to \u201claws,\u201d \u201cstatutes,\u201d and \u201ccovenant\u201d sound much like language regarding Israel, but this is not Israel, it is the world. What is the point? How can the inhabitants of the earth be held accountable for what was exclusively revealed to the Israelites? In fact, like Paul in Romans 1, Isaiah insists that apart from the Sinai covenant, there are laws that God the Creator has written on the human conscience. Thus, he will not admit any argument of ignorance as justification for sin.<\/p>     <p>\u2003Implicit here is the understanding that humans know enough to behave better than they do. There are common standards of human behavior; if we violate them, we do so to our own destruction. The \u201ccovenant\u201d referred to here may be the Noachic covenant of Genesis 9:1\u201317 with its prohibition of bloodshed. Here again is an understanding between the creature and the Creator that is not dependent on special revelation. Rather, it has been passed down through the ages as common human heritage.<\/p>     <p>\u2003Thus, judgment is not coming on the earth because the gods have decided that humans are too noisy, as in the Sumerian flood story, or because one god has flown into a rage at a petty slight, as is the case in some other myths. Destruction is coming because humans have violated the terms of their creation. Israel\u2019s God is the Creator of all the nations, and they are accountable to him, and him alone. One of the features of covenants was the custom of the parties calling down curses on themselves for failure to keep the covenant. That is what has happened to earth\u2019s inhabitants: They are under a \u201ccurse\u201d and bear \u201cguilt\u201d for what they have done (24:6).<\/p>     <p>\u2003Dried up like a vine cut off from its roots, the \u201ccity\u201d of earth (24:10, 12) lies silent and desolate. The forced and artificial gaiety induced by alcohol (24:7, 9, 11) vanishes like a vapor before the awful realities of judgment and destruction. Despite the effort of some commentators to argue that a specific city (e.g., Jerusalem or Babylon) is intended in these references, it seems clear that this is not the case. Rather, the earth as a whole is treated under the image of \u201ccity.\u201d It is easy to see why this might be the case. The city offers wealth, glamour, excitement, pleasure, intrigue, and power\u2014all the things humans are prone to sell their souls for. But as mighty and alluring as the city of earth is, a day of harvest is coming when all the fruit will be stripped off and nothing will be left of all the riches that earthlings thought were their own (24:13).<\/p>     ",
