The whole nation was reeling to and fro, and unsettled in their counsels, as a man is who is so intoxicated as to reel and to vomit. Nothing could more strikingly express, first, the &ldquo;fact&rdquo; of their perverted counsels and plans, and secondly, God&rsquo;s deep abhorrence of the course which they were pursuing.<\/p> ",
