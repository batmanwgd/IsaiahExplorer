Men are not to expect that they, the hypocrites and evil-doers, shall escape their punishment. The promise of restoration is for the remnant only. (Comp. St. Paul\u2019s application of the text in <a class=\"ref\">Romans 9:27-28<\/a>).<\/p> \n<p>The consumption decreed shall overflow with righteousness.\u2014Literally, a finished (or final) work, decisive, overflowing with righteousness. A like phrase meets us again in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTg3XQ==\">Isaiah 28:22<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\">Daniel 9:27<\/a>. The \u201cfinished work\u201d is that of God\u2019s judgment, and it \u201coverflows with righteousness\u201d at once punitive and corrective.<\/p> ",
