    "html": "<p> Thus the second hymnic echo has its confirmation in a prophecy against Moab, on the basis of which a third hymnic echo now arises. Whilst on the other side, in the land of Moab, the people are trodden down, and its lofty castles demolished, the people in the land of Judah can boast of an impregnable city. <em> \u201cIn that day will this song be sung in the land of Judah: A city of defence is ours; salvation He sets for walls and bulwark.\u201d<\/em> According to the punctuation, this ought to be rendered, \u201cA city is a shelter for us;\u201d but \u05e2\u05d6 \u05e2\u05d9\u05e8 seem rather to be connected, according to <a class=\"ref\">Proverbs 17:19<\/a>, \u201ca city of strong, i.e., of impregnable offence and defence.\u201d The subject of \u05d9\u05e9\u05c1\u05d9\u05ea is Jehovah. The figure indicates what He is constantly doing, and ever doing afresh; for the walls and bulwarks of Jerusalem (<em> che\u0304l <\/em> , as in <a class=\"ref\">Lamentations 2:8<\/a>, the small outside wall which encloses all the fortifications) are not dead stone, but <em> yeshua\u0302h <\/em> , ever living and never exhausted <em> salvation<\/em> (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODQwXQ==\">Isaiah 60:18<\/a>). In just the same sense Jehovah is called elsewhere the wall of Jerusalem, and even a wall of fire in <a class=\"ref\">Zechariah 2:9<\/a> - parallels which show that <em> yeshua\u0302h <\/em> is intended to be taken as the accusative of the object, and not as the accusative of the predicate, according to <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzQ2LDE0MTk5LDE1MjY3LDE5NDYxXQ==\">Isaiah 5:6; Psalms 21:7; Psalms 84:7; Jeremiah 22:6<\/a> (Luzzatto).<\/p>",
