The Book of Mormon text adds the words, \"O isles of the sea.\" The Lord will answer the prayers of Israel, though she is scattered to the \"isles of the sea\" (continents far beyond Asia). Remember that even the Americas were considered by their ancient inhabitants to be an \"isle of the sea.\" (<a class=\"ref\">2 Nephi 10:20<\/a>.)
