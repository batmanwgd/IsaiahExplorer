On the hill-sides, every inch of which was once brought under careful vine culture, \u201cThou wilt not enter for fear of thorns and briars\u201d i.e., thou wilt not venture on the task of tilling the soil in face of such disarrangements. What would be the use of hoeing such a tangled mass of brushwood? At the best it must be left for such pasturage as oxen and sheep might find there as they browsed, and they by their trampling should but increase the mischief. The rendering of the Authorised version conveys the thought that where there was the careful culture thus described, there should be an exception to the general desolation. Below this, if we accept it, there may be a spiritual meaning like that of <a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 4:3 <\/a> (Kay). <\/p> ",
