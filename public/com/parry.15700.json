As the Lord said in Matthew 24: \"Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken: And then&hellip;they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory\" (<a class=\"ref\">Matt. 24:29-30<\/a>; see <a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 29:11-14; 45:39<\/a>). Perhaps earthquakes and volcanic activity in the last days will cover the heavens with blackness.<\/p> <p> Elder Bruce R. McConkie gave another interpretation: \"'I clothe the heavens with blackness' (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NjY2XQ==\">Isa. 50:3<\/a>), and there is no more revelation&hellip;. Thus saith our God. Such is his promise, spoken prophetically of our day. And here, given in modern times, is his announcement that as he spake, so has it come to pass: 'Verily, verily, I say unto you, darkness covereth the earth, and gross darkness the minds of the people, and all flesh has become corrupt before my face.' (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 112:23<\/a>).\" <\/p> <p><i>sackcloth.<\/i> <i>Sackcloth<\/i> is the clothing of mourning. Here, the darkness of the heavens may symbolize the mourning of the wicked at the second coming of Christ. Or it may symbolize the mourning of the righteous, and of the heavens and earth.<\/p> ",
