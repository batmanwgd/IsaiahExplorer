There had been such invasions in the days of Ahaz, in which Israel and Syria (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 7:1<\/a>), Edom and the Philistines, had been conspicuous (<a class=\"ref\">2 Chronicles 28:17-18<\/a>); and the reign of Hezekiah already had witnessed that of Sargon (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 20:1<\/a>).<\/p>\n <p>The Hebrew has no copulative verb, but joins subject and predicate together with the emphasis of abruptness: Your land\u2014a desolation, and so on. The repetition of the word \u201cstrangers\u201d is characteristic of Isaiah\u2019s style.<\/p>\n <p>As overthrown by strangers.\u2014Conjectural readings give (1) \u201cas the overthrow of Sodom;\u201d (2) \u201cas the overthrow of (i.e., wrought by) a rain-storm.\u201d The word rendered \u201coverthrown\u201d is elsewhere applied only to the destruction of the cities of the plain (<a class=\"ref\">Deuteronomy 29:23; Amos 4:11; Jeremiah 49:18<\/a>). So taken, the clause prepares the way for the fuller comparison of <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 1:9-10<\/a>.<\/p>",
