His promise gives them hope, no matter in what circumstances they find themselves. The verbs &ldquo;have compassion&rdquo; and &ldquo;choose&rdquo; denote the elect status of those who prove faithful in keeping the terms of Jehovah&rsquo;s covenant. For them, its blessings ultimately become unconditional (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODY4MF0seyIxODczMCI6NX0sWzE4ODQzXSx7IjE4OTE1Ijo2fV0=\">Isaiah 51:6; 54:6-10; 60:21; 65:17-22 <\/a>). Many who observe how Jehovah blesses his people unite with them to become one nation in the end. <\/p> ",
