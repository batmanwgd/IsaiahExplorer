His promise gives them hope, no matter in what circumstances they find themselves. The verbs &ldquo;have compassion&rdquo; and &ldquo;choose&rdquo; denote the elect status of those who prove faithful in keeping the terms of Jehovah&rsquo;s covenant. For them, its blessings ultimately become unconditional (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 51:6; 54:6-10; 60:21; 65:17-22<\/a>). Many who observe how Jehovah blesses his people unite with them to become one nation in the end.<\/p>",
