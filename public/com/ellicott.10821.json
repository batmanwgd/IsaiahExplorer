    "html": "<p>Therefore hell hath enlarged herself.\u2014The Hebrew Sheol, or Hades, like \u201chell\u201d itself in its original meaning, expressed not a place of torment, but the vast shadow \u2013 world of death, thought of as being below the earth (<a class=\"ref\">Psalms 16:10; Psalms 49:14<\/a>). Here, as elsewhere (<a class=\"ref\">Jonah 2:2; Proverbs 1:12; Proverbs 30:16<\/a>), it is half-personified, as Hades and Death are in <a class=\"ref\">Revelation 6:8; Revelation 20:13-14<\/a>. In that unseen world there were, in the later belief of Judaism, the two regions of Gehenna and of Eden or Paradise. What the prophet says is that all the pomp and glory of the rich oppressors are on their way to that inevitable doom. The word for \u201cglory\u201d (as in <a class=\"ref\">1 Samuel 4:22<\/a>) is the same as that for \u201chonourable men\u201d in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzUzXQ==\">Isaiah 5:13<\/a>, so that the original has all the emphasis of repetition. <\/p>",
