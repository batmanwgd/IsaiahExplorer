    "html": "<p> (1) The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz . . .\u2014The term \u201cvision,\u201d as descriptive of a prophet\u2019s work (<a class=\"ref\">1 Samuel 3:1<\/a>), is the correlative of the old term \u201cseer,\u201d as applied to the prophet himself (<a class=\"ref\">1 Samuel 9:9<\/a>). The latter fell into disuse, probably because the pretenders to the clairvoyance which it implied brought it into discredit. The prophet, however, did not cease to be a \u201cseer;\u201d and to see visions was still one of the highest forms of the gift of the spirit of Jehovah (<a class=\"ref\">Joel 2:28<\/a>). It describes the state, more or less ecstatic, in which the prophet sees what others do not see, the things that are yet to come, the unseen working of the eternal laws of God. As compared with \u201cthe word of the Lord,\u201d it indicates a higher intensity of the ecstatic state; but the two terms were closely associated, and, as in<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3Njg3XQ==\">Isaiah 2:1<\/a> , a man was said to see \u201cthe word of the Lord.\u201d Judah and Jerusalem are named as the centre, though not the limit, of the prophet\u2019s work.<\/p> ",
