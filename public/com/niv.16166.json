The message seems to concern Edom (\u201cSeir,\u201d 21:11), but it is addressed to the Arabian oasis Dumah, which was about three hundred miles southeast of Jerusalem. This oasis was at the intersection of the east-west trade route from Babylon to Edom and Egypt, and the north-south route from the Red Sea to Palmyra. Undoubtedly, the fate of Babylon is of great concern to Dumah, and farther west to Edom. In view of the fact that the third oracle in this cycle clearly concerns the Arabians and the other great oasis of Tema, it seems best to retain the reference to Dumah.<\/p>     <p>\u2003But what of the message itself? Perhaps the thought is that even the Edomites turn to Isaiah, the Judean \u201cwatchman,\u201d to see what is happening in the east. Because of his God he is able to see the future in ways the ordinary \u201cseer\u201d cannot. But if that is the case, the message given is a rather enigmatic one. In 21:4, the speaker admitted that the longed-for twilight had not produced relief. Now the prophet seems to be saying that the longed-for dawn may not be a relief either, for night will swiftly follow it. This may refer to the Assyrian \u201cnight\u201d ending, but a Babylonian \u201cnight\u201d following it in swift succession. It may also speak of the coming defeat of Sennacherib in 701 B.C. (\u201cdawn\u201d), but the subsequent destruction of Babylon in whom Judah is trusting in 689 <small>B.C.<\/small> (\u201cnight\u201d).<\/p>     ",
