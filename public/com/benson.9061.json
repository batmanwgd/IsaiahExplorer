And that such a place and people should reject Immanuel, when he should appear, was so strange an occurrence, that the prediction of it was highly necessary, lest otherwise, when it came to pass, it should shake the faith of all who did believe on him; whereas, now the accomplishment hereof was a notable confirmation of their faith. <i>And many among them <\/i>\u2014Not all; for there shall be a remnant, as was foretold, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzM2LDE3NzgzXQ==\">Isaiah 4:2; Isaiah 6:13<\/a>; <i>shall stumble <\/i>\u2014At that stone or rock, mentioned <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODIyXQ==\">Isaiah 8:14<\/a>. The writers of the New Testament, who have so frequently quoted this passage, prove, beyond all controversy, that the subject of it is, <i>God manifest in the flesh; <\/i> the Messiah, who performed for his people all those benefits of grace which this promise implies, being a sanctuary, or place of refuge to them; and who, at the same time, became to the hypocrites and unbelievers in Judea, <i>a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence, <\/i> to the destruction of the far greater part of that people.
