Isaiah has acknowledged Israel's unworthiness but nevertheless asks the Lord to come in his glory to deliver her (63:15-19; 64:1-12). In response to Isaiah's prayer, the Lord says that his people were rejected because they rejected him (65:1-7, 11-12; 66:4). But the repentant will be forgiven (65:8-10, 13-16; 66:1-2, 7-14), and the righteous will triumph at the Second Coming (66:14-21) and during the Millennium (65:17-25; 66:22-24).<\/p> <p> The Lord says that those who seek him righteously will find him (65:1), and he has reached out in great long-suffering to us (65:2). But the covenant people have continually sought after evil, worshiping idols and choosing the way of wickedness instead of the way of God (65:2-5). The Lord will punish all such; they will receive according to their works (65:6-7).<\/p> <p>Paul quoted <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODg5OSI6Mn0=\">Isa. 65:1-2<\/a> in <a class=\"ref\">Rom. 10:20-21<\/a>: \"But Esaias is very bold, and saith, I was found of them that sought me not; I was made manifest unto them that asked not after me. But to Israel [God] saith, All day long I have stretched forth my hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people.\"<\/p> <blockquote>[<i>I am found of them<\/i> <u>who seek after me<\/u>,     <br><i>I give unto all them<\/i> <u>that ask of me<\/u>;]     <br><i>I am [not] found<\/i> of them <u>that sought me not<\/u>,     <br>[or <u>that inquireth not after me<\/u>.]     <br>I said [unto my servant],     <br><i>Behold<\/i> <u>me<\/u>,     <br>[<i>look upon<\/i> <u>me<\/u>;     <br><i>I will send you] unto<\/i> a <u>nation that [is] not called [after] my name<\/u>, [for] (65:1)     <br><i>I have spread out my hands all the day [to]<\/i> a&hellip;<u>people [who] walketh [not] in [my ways<\/u>],     <br>[and <i>their works <\/i><u>are evil<\/u> and] not good,     <br>[and <i>they walk<\/i>]<i> <\/i><u>after their own thoughts<\/u>; (65:2)     <br>A people that provoketh me to anger continually to my face;     <br>that <i>sacrificeth<\/i> <u>in gardens<\/u>,     <br>and <i>burneth incense<\/i> <u>upon altars of brick<\/u>; (65:3)     <br><i>Which remain<\/i> <u>among the graves<\/u>,     <br>and <i>lodge<\/i> <u>in the monuments<\/u>,     <br>which <i>eat<\/i> <u>swine's flesh, and broth<\/u> of abominable [beasts,     <br>and <i>pollute<\/i>] <u>their vessels<\/u>; (65:4)     <br>Which say, <i>Stand<\/i> <u>by thyself<\/u>,     <br><i>come<\/i> <u>not near to me<\/u>; for I am holier than thou.     <br>These are a <i>smoke<\/i> in my nose,     <br>a <i>fire that burneth<\/i> all the day.
