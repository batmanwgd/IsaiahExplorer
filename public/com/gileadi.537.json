    "html": "<p>Historically, statues of the two chief Babylonian gods, &ldquo;Bel&rdquo; or &ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; alias Marduk or Merodach (<a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 50:2<\/a>)&mdash;the Babylonian equivalent of the Canaanite god Baal&mdash;and his son &ldquo;Nebo&rdquo; were carried in procession at the Babylonian New Year Festival. Isaiah depicts them satirically as going into captivity together with their devotees who appear quite unaware of the glaring paradox. Instead of saving their adherents from subjection to enemies, they too have become mere burdens hauled away into exile with other chattels. The idolaters&rsquo; displacement and captivity represent a variant chaos motif.<\/p> ",
