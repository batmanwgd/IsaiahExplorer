    "html": "<p> The prophet now proceeds to point out the reward of divine grace, which would follow such a fast as this, consisting of self-renouncing, self-sacrificing love; and in the midst of the promise he once more reminds of the fact, that this love is the condition of the promise. This divides the promises into two. The middle promise is linked on to the first; the morning dawn giving promise of the \u201cperfect day\u201d (<a class=\"ref\">Proverbs 4:18<\/a>). The first series of promises we have in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4Nzk1XQ==\">Isaiah 58:8<\/a>,  . <em> \u201cThen will thy light break forth as the morning dawn, and thy healing will sprout up speedily, and thy righteousness will go before thee, the glory of Jehovah will follow thee. Then wilt thou call and Jehovah will answer; thou wilt beseech, and He will say, Here am I!\u201d<\/em> The love of God is called \u201clight\u201d in contrast with His wrath; and a quiet cheerful life in God's love is so called, in contrast with a wild troubled life spent in God's wrath. This life in God's love has its dawn and its noon-day. When it is night both within and around a man, and he suffers himself to be awakened by the love of God to a reciprocity of love; then does the love of God, like the rising sun, open for itself a way through the man's dark night and overcome the darkness of wrath, but so gradually that the sky within is at first only streaked as it were with the red of the morning dawn, the herald of the sun. A second figure of a promising character follows. The man is sick unto death; but when the love of God stimulates him to reciprocal love, he is filled with new vigour, and his recovery springs up suddenly; he feels within him a new life working through with energetic force like a miraculous springing up of <em> verdure <\/em> from the earth, or of growing and flowering plants. The only other passages in which \u05d0\u05e8\u05d5\u05bc\u05db\u05d4 occurs are in the books of Jeremiah, Chronicles, and Nehemiah. It signifies recovery (lxx here, \u03c4\u03b1\u0300 \u03b9\u0313\u03b1\u0301\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u0301 \u03c3\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c4\u03b1\u03c7\u03c5\u0300 \u03b1\u0313\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u0342 , an old mistake for \u03b9\u0314\u03bc\u03b1\u0301\u03c4\u03b9\u03b1 , <em> vestimenta <\/em> ), and hence general prosperity (<a class=\"ref\">2 Chronicles 24:13<\/a>). It always occurs with the predicate \u05e2\u05dc\u05ea\u05d4 (causative \u05d4\u05e2\u05dc\u05d4 , cf., Targ. <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 147:3<\/a>, \u05d0\u05e8\u05db\u05d0 \u05d0\u05e1\u05bc\u05e7 , another reading \u05d0\u05e8\u05d5\u05bc\u05db\u05d9\u05df ) , <em> oritur <\/em> (for which we have here poetically <em> germinat <\/em> ) <em> alicui sanitas <\/em> ; hence Gesenius and others have inferred, that the word originally meant the binding up of a wound, bandage (<em> impontiru alicui fascia <\/em> ). But the primary word is \u05d0\u05e8 \u05da = \u05d0\u05e8 \u05da , to set to rights, to restore or put into the right condition (e.g., <em> b. Sabbath<\/em> 33<em> b<\/em> , \u201che cured his wounded flesh\u201d), connected with \u05d0\u05e8\u05d9\u05da , Arab. <em> a\u0302rak <\/em> , <em> accommodatus <\/em> ; so that \u05d0\u05e8\u05d5\u05bc\u05db\u05d4 , after the form \u05de\u05dc\u05d5\u05bc\u05db\u05d4 , Arab. (though rarely) <em> arika <\/em> , signifies properly, setting to rights, i.e., restoration. <\/p><p> The third promise is: \u201cthy righteousness will go before thee, the glory of Jehovah will gather thee, or keep thee together,\u201d i.e., be thy rear-guard (lxx \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u0342 \u03c3\u03b5 , enclose thee with its protection; \u05d0\u05e1\u05e3 as in \u05de\u05d0\u05e1\u05bc\u05e3 , <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzA5XQ==\">Isaiah 52:12<\/a>). The figure is a significant one: the first of the mercies of God is \u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c5\u0342\u03bd , and the last \u03b4\u03bf\u03be\u03b1\u0301\u03b6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd . When Israel is diligent in the performance of works of compassionate love, it is like an army on the march or a travelling caravan, for which righteousness clear and shows the way as being the most appropriate gift of God, and whose rear is closed by the glory of God, which so conducts it to its goal that not one is left behind. The fourth promise assures them of the immediate hearing of prayer, of every appeal to God, every cry for help.<\/p><p> But before the prophet brings his promises up to their culminating point, he once more lays down the condition upon which they rest. <em> \u201cIf thou put away from the midst of thee the yoke, the pointing of the finger, and speaking of evil, and offerest up thy gluttony to the hungry, and satisfiest the soul that is bowed down: thy light will stream out in the darkness, and thy darkness become like the brightness of noon-day. And Jehovah will guide thee continually, and satisfy thy soul in droughts, and refresh thy bones; and thou wilt become like a well-watered garden, and like a fountain, whose waters never deceive. And thy people will build ruins of the olden time, foundations of earlier generations wilt thou erect; and men will call thee repairers of breaches, restorers of habitable streets.\u201d<\/em> \u05de\u05d5\u05d8\u05d4 , a yoke, is here equivalent to yoking or oppression, as in  , where it stands by the side of \u05e8\u05e9\u05c1\u05e2 . \u05e9\u05c1\u05dc\u05d7\u05be\u05d0\u05e6\u05d1\u05bc\u05d0 (only met with here, for \u05e9\u05c1\u05dc\u05d7 , Ges. \u00a765, 1,<em> a<\/em> ), the stretching out of the finger, signifies a scornful pointing with the fingers (<a class=\"ref\">Proverbs 6:13<\/a>, \u03b4\u03b1\u03ba\u03c4\u03c5\u03bb\u03bf\u03b4\u03b5\u03b9\u03ba\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9\u0342\u03bd ) at humbler men, and especially at such as are godly (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzcwXQ==\">Isaiah 57:4<\/a>). \u05d3\u05bc\u05d1\u05bc\u05e8\u05be\u05d0\u05d5\u05df , the utterance of things which are wicked in themselves and injurious to one's neighbour, hence sinful conversation in general. The early commentators looked for more under \u05e0\u05e4\u05e9\u05c1 \u05da , than is really meant (and so does even Stier: \u201cthey soul, thy heart, all thy sympathetic feelings,\u201d etc.). The name of the soul, which is regarded here as greedily longing (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzY1XQ==\">Isaiah 56:11<\/a>), is used in <a class=\"ref\">Deuteronomy 24:6<\/a> for that which nourishes it, and here for that which it longs for; the longing itself (<em> appetitus <\/em> ) for the object of the longing (<em> Psychol.<\/em> p. 204). We may see this very clearly from the choice of the verb \u05ea\u05bc\u05e4\u05e7 (a voluntative in a conditional clause, Ges. \u00a7128, 2), which, starting from the primary meaning <em> educere <\/em> (related to \u05e0\u05e4\u05e7 , Arabic <em> anfaqa <\/em> , to give out, distribute, <em> nafaqa <\/em> , distribution, especially of alms), signifies both to work out, acquire, carry off (<a class=\"ref\">Proverbs 3:13; Proverbs 8:35<\/a>, etc.), and also to take out, deliver, offer, <em> expromere <\/em> (as in this instance and <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 140:9; Psalms 144:13<\/a>). The soul \u201cbowed down\u201d is bowed down in this instance through abstinence. The apodoses commence with the <em> perf. cons.<\/em> \u05d5\u05d6\u05e8\u05d7 . \u05d0\u05e4\u05dc\u05d4 is the darkness caused by the utter absence of light (Arab. <em> afalat esh - shemsu <\/em> , \u201cthe sun has become invisible\u201d); see at <a class=\"ref\">Job 10:22<\/a>. This, as the substantive clause affirms, is like the noon-day, which is called \u05e6\u05d4\u05e8\u05d9 \u05dd , because at that point the daylight of both the forenoon and afternoon, the rising and setting light, is divided as it were into two by the climax which it has attained. A new promise points to the fat, that such a man may enjoy without intermission the mild and safe guidance of divine grace, for which \u05e0\u05d7\u05d4 ( \u05d4\u05e0\u05d7\u05d4 , syn. \u05e0\u05d4\u05dc ) is the word commonly employed; and another to the communication of the most copious supply of strength. The \u03b1\u0314\u0301\u03c0\u03b1\u03be \u03b3\u03b5\u03b3\u03c1 \u05d1\u05e6\u05d7\u05e6\u05d7\u05d5\u05ea does not state with what God will satisfy the soul, as Hahn supposes (after Jerome, \u201c<em> splendoribus <\/em> \u201d), but according to \u05e6\u05e1\u05d4\u05d9\u05d7\u05d4 (<a class=\"ref\">Psalms 68:7<\/a>) and such promises as <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NTI2LDE4NjM2LDE4NjQ3XQ==\">Isaiah 43:20; Isaiah 48:21; Isaiah 49:10<\/a>, the kind of satisfaction and the circumstances under which it occurs, viz., in extreme droughts (Targ. \u201cyears of drought\u201d). In the place of the <em> perf. cons.<\/em> we have then the future, which facilitates the elevation of the object: \u201cand thy bones will He make strong,\u201d \u05d9\u05d7\u05dc\u05d9\u05d7 , for which Hupfeld would read \u05d9\u05d7\u05dc\u05d9\u05e3 , \u201cwill He rejuvenate.\u201d \u05d7\u05d7\u05dc\u05d9 \u05e5 is a denom. of \u05d7\u05dc\u05d5\u05bc \u05e5 , <em> expeditus <\/em> ; it may, however, be directly derived from a verb \u05d7\u05dc \u05e5 , presupposed by \u05d7\u05dc\u05e6\u05d9 \u05dd , not, however, in the meaning \u201cto be fat\u201d (lxx \u03c0\u03b9\u03b1\u03bd\u03b8\u03b7\u0301\u03c3\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 , and so also Kimchi), but \u201cto be strong,\u201d lit., to be loose or ready for action; and <em> b. Jebamoth <\/em> 102<em> b<\/em> has the very suitable gloss \u05d2\u05e8\u05de\u05d9 \u05d6\u05e8\u05d5\u05d6\u05d9 (making the bones strong). This idea of invigorating is then unfolded in two different figures, of which that of a well-watered garden sets forth the abundance received, that of a spring the abundance possessed. Natural objects are promised, but as a gift of grace; for this is the difference between the two testaments, that in the Old Testament the natural is ever striving to reach the spiritual, whereas in the New Testament the spiritual lifts up the natural to its own level. The Old Testament is ever striving to give inwardness to what was outward; in the New Testament this object is attained, and the further object now is to make the outward conformed to the inward, the natural life to the spiritual. <\/p><p> The last promise (whether the seventh or eighth, depends upon whether we include the growing of the morning light into the light of noon, or not) takes its form from the pining of the exiles for their home: \u201cand thy people ( \u05de\u05de\u05bc \u05da ) build\u201d (Ewald, \u00a7295,<em> c<\/em> ); and B\u00f6ttcher would read \u05de\u05de \u05da \u05d5\u05bc\u05d1\u05e0\u05bc\u05d5\u05bc ; but \u05de\u05df with a passive, although more admissible in Hebrew than in Arabic, is very rarely met with, and then more frequently in the sense of \u03b1\u0313\u03c0\u03bf\u0301 than in that of \u03c5\u0314\u03c0\u03bf\u0301 , and \u05d1\u05bc\u05e0\u05bc\u05d5\u05bc followed by a plural of the thing would be more exact than customary. Moreover, there is no force in the objection that \u05de\u05de\u05bc \u05da with the active can only signify \u201csome of thee,\u201d since it is equivalent to \u05de\u05de\u05da \u05d0\u05e9\u05c1\u05e8 , those who sprang from thee and belong to thee by kindred descent. The members born to the congregation in exile will begin, as soon as they return to their home, to build up again the ruins of olden time, the foundations of earlier generations, i.e., houses and cities of which only the foundations are left (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODQ4XQ==\">Isaiah 61:4<\/a>); therefore Israel restored to its fatherland receives the honourable title of \u201cbuilder of breaches,\u201d \u201crestorer of streets (i.e., of places much frequented once) \u05dc\u05e9\u05c1\u05d1\u05ea \u201d (for inhabiting), i.e., so that, although so desolate now (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4Mjg4XQ==\">Isaiah 33:8<\/a>), they become habitable and populous once more.<\/p>",
