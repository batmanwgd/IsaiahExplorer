Assuredly all who follow the Lord and His chosen servants will not walk in darkness or have reason to fear. Yet those who walk by their own light, relying on their own limited reasoning, will be sorrowful, for they will be \"cut off from among [His] people.\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 1:14<\/a>.)<\/p>     <table>         <tbody>             <tr>                 <td>10 Who is among you that feareth the Lord, that obeyeth the voice of his servant, that walketh in darkness<u>,<\/u> and hath no light? <u>let him trust in the name of the Lord, and stay upon his God.<\/u>                     <br>                     <br>11 Behold<u>,<\/u> all ye that kindle a fire, that compass yourselves about with sparks<u>:<\/u> walk in the light of your fire<u>,<\/u> and in the sparks <u>that<\/u> ye have kindled.
