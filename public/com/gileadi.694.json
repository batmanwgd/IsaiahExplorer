Jehovah&rsquo;s servant sets the standard by exemplifying Jehovah&rsquo;s <em>righteousness<\/em> and serving as their <em>light<\/em> (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3sic2luZ2xlcyI6WzE4NDU0LDE4NDg3LDE4NjQzXX0seyIxODU5OCI6M31d\">Isaiah 41:2; 42:6; 46:11-13; 49:6<\/a>), facilitating Jehovah coming as <em>salvation<\/em> like a &ldquo;flaming torch&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3sic2luZ2xlcyI6WzE4NDYzLDE3ODY4LDE3OTAzXX0seyIxODUxNyI6Mn1d\">v 11; Isaiah 10:17; 12:2; 43:11-12<\/a>; cf. <a class=\"ref\">Genesis 15:17<\/a>).

These individuals&mdash;as inferred from the personal pronoun &ldquo;I&rdquo;&mdash;pass through many of the same or similar experiences the servant does, so that, based on the principle of &ldquo;the one and the many,&rdquo; even their identities come close to merging: as he calls on the name of Jehovah, so do they (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3sic2luZ2xlcyI6WzE4NDc3XX0seyIxODQ1OCI6Mn1d\">vv 6-7; Isaiah 41:25<\/a>); as he declares good tidings, so do they (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3sic2luZ2xlcyI6WzE4NDYzXX0seyIxODcwNCI6Mn1d\">v 11; Isaiah 52:7-8<\/a>); as he suffers affronts, so do they (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3sic2luZ2xlcyI6WzE4ODUxXX0seyIxODY2OSI6Mn1d\">Isaiah 50:6-7; 61:7<\/a>).<\/p>",
