Jehovah&rsquo;s servant sets the standard by exemplifying Jehovah&rsquo;s <em>righteousness <\/em> and serving as their <em>light <\/em> (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODQ1NCwxODQ4N10seyIxODU5OCI6M30sWzE4NjQzXV0=\">Isaiah 41:2; 42:6; 46:11-13; 49:6 <\/a>), facilitating Jehovah coming as <em>salvation <\/em> like a &ldquo;flaming torch&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODg2NiwxNzg2OCwxNzkwM10seyIxODUxNyI6Mn1d\">v 11; Isaiah 10:17; 12:2; 43:11-12 <\/a>; cf. <a class=\"ref\">Genesis 15:17 <\/a>). In effect, as soon as his people proximate the servant&rsquo;s righteousness, Jehovah comes. <\/p> <p>In that sense, many things that describe the servant may apply also to Zion&rsquo;s watchmen&mdash;those servants whom Jehovah raises up who unitedly accomplish his people&rsquo;s restoration. These individuals&mdash;as inferred from the personal pronoun &ldquo;I&rdquo;&mdash;pass through many of the same or similar experiences the servant does, so that, based on the principle of &ldquo;the one and the many,&rdquo; even their identities come close to merging: as he calls on the name of Jehovah, so do they (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg4NjEiOjJ9LFsxODQ3N11d\">vv 6-7; Isaiah 41:25 <\/a>); as he declares good tidings, so do they (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODg2Nl0seyIxODcwNCI6Mn1d\">v 11; Isaiah 52:7-8 <\/a>); as he suffers affronts, so do they (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg2NjkiOjJ9LFsxODg1MV1d\">Isaiah 50:6-7; 61:7 <\/a>). <\/p> ",
