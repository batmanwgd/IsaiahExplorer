Dil-worth Young interpreted verse 3, Jesus was \"despised\" because he was a Nazarene (see CR, Apr. 1974, p. 87; see also <a class=\"ref\">John 1:46; Matt. 2:23<\/a>).<\/p>     <p>Matthew quoted the first part of verse 4 and said that it was fulfilled when many were brought to Jesus and were healed or had evil spirits cast out of them (<a class=\"ref\">Matt. 8:16-17<\/a>; compare <a class=\"ref\">Mosiah 3:5-6; Alma 7:11<\/a>). Peter was apparently paraphrasing the first part of verse 4 to show that it was fulfilled when Christ was lifted up on the cross, which was the culmination of his physical suffering (see <a class=\"ref\">1 Pet. 2:24<\/a>). Yet when he was on the cross, people thought his suffering was the judgment of God coming upon him, a common belief about suffering in that age (see <a class=\"ref\">Mosiah 3:9<\/a>).<\/p>     ",
