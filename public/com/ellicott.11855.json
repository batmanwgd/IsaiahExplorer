The transition from the denunciations of the preceding verse is abrupt, and suggests the thought of an interval of time and absence of direct continuity. Possibly, however, a link may be found in the \u201cfirst\u201d of the amended translation, which prepares the way for something that is to follow. God chastens, but does not destroy.<\/p> \n<p>Destroy it not . . .\u2014The thought is that as even one fruitful cluster of grapes will lead the vine-dresser to spare an otherwise fruitless vine in the hope of a fuller blessing in the future, so Jehovah will spare a sinful nation for the twenty or the ten righteous (<a class=\"ref\">Genesis 18:23-33<\/a>). The words \u201cdestroy it not\u201d are those which stand at the head of Psalms 57-59, as indicating the tune to which they were to be sung; and it is a natural inference that it may have been a popular vintage song, and therefore doubly apt for the prophet\u2019s purpose. May we compare our own song of \u201cWood-man, spare that tree?\u201d applied, as it has been, to the trees of ancient institutions.<\/p> ",
