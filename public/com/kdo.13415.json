His zeal will not be extinguished, nor will anything break His strength, till He shall have secured for right a firm standing on the earth (<span class=\"normal hebrew\">,\u05d9\u05e9\u05c2\u05d9\u05dd<\/span>, is a <i>fut. ex.<\/i>, so far as the meaning is concerned, like <span class=\"normal hebrew\">,\u05d9\u05d1\ufb46\u05e2<\/span>, in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODYzXQ==\">Isaiah 10:12<\/a>). The question arises now, whether what follows is also governed by <span class=\"normal hebrew\">,\u05e2\u05d3<\/span>, in the sense of \u201cand until the islands shall have believed his instruction,\u201d as Hitzig supposes; or whether it is an independent sentence, as rendered by the lxx and in <a class=\"ref\">Matthew 12:21<\/a>. We prefer the latter, both because of <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4Njc5XQ==\">Isaiah 51:5<\/a>, and also because, although <span class=\"normal hebrew\">,\u05dc\u05d3\u05d1\u05e8\u05d4 <\/span> <span class=\"normal hebrew\">,\u05d9\u05d7\u05dc<\/span>, may certainly mean to exercise a believing confidence in the word of God (<a class=\"ref\">Psalm 119:74, Psalm 119:81<\/a>), <span class=\"normal hebrew\">,\u05dc\u05ea\u05d5\u05e8\u05ea\u05d5 <\/span> <span class=\"normal hebrew\">,\u05d9\u05d7\u05dc<\/span>, can only mean \u201cto wait with longing for a person's instruction\u201d (<a class=\"ref\">Job 29:23<\/a>), and especially in this case, where no thought is more naturally suggested, than that the messenger to the Gentile world will be welcomed by a consciousness of need already existing in the heathen world itself. There is a <i>gratia praeparans<\/i>, at work in the Gentile world, as these prophecies all presuppose, in perfect harmony with the Gospel of John, with which they have so much affinity; and it is an actual fact, that the cry for redemption runs through the whole human race, i.e., an earnest longing, the ultimate object of which, however unconsciously, is the servant of Jehovah and his instruction from Zion (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3Njg5XQ==\">Isaiah 2:3<\/a>) - in other words, the gospel. <br> <\/p>",
