The sower will not put into the earth as much as he can, nor will he throw it in at random, but will measure the ground, and give to it as much as is necessary; for otherwise the superfluous mass would rot, and not a single grain would take root. <\/p> \n <p> <i>Wheat in measure, and barley measured. <\/i> He will not mix various seeds, but will allot one part of the field for \u201cwheat,\u201d another for \u201cvetches,\u201d and another for \u201ccummin.\u201d He will do this in measure, for that I consider to be the proper interpretation of <span class=\"greek-hebrew\"> \u05e9\u05d5\u05e8\u05d4 <\/span> (<i>s\u014dr\u0101h <\/i>.) It does not mean excellent or good; for he is speaking about measurement. Similar statements are made about reaping and thrashing; for all kinds of grain are not thrashed in the same manner. Wheat is thrashed with the wheel of a cart or wagon, vetches with a staff, and cummin with a thicker rod. He speaks according to the custom of the country. This mode of thrashing is unknown in any part of France, except Provence. In short, he means that the manner of thrashing which is suitable to the grain does not apply equally to all. Besides, the husbandman is not constantly or incessantly employed in thrashing, but exercises moderation, that he may not bruise the grain. <\/p> ",
