But the copy which the LXX. followed, instead of the Hebrew words, <span class=\"hebrew_text\">,\u05d4\u05d7\u05e8\u05e9\u05c1 \u05d5\u05d4\u05d0\u05de\u05d9\u05e8 <\/span>,, <i>hacho-resh vehaamir, <\/i>,that is, <i>bough and uppermost branch, <\/i>,must have read <span class=\"hebrew_text\">,\u05d4\u05d7\u05d5\u05d9 \u05d5\u05d4\u05d0\u05de\u05e8\u05d9 <\/span>,, <i>hachivi vehaemori, the Hivites and Amorites: <\/i> <\/p>,\n <p>for they translate the verse thus: <i>Thy cities shall be forsaken, as when the Hivites and Amorites forsook <\/i>,them, because of the <i>children of Israel. <\/i>,Which reading gives a plain and full sense to the text.\u201d Thus also his son, Bishop Lowth: \u201cThe translation of the LXX has happily preserved what seems to be the true reading of the text, as it stood in the copies of their time. And it is remarkable, that many commentators, who never thought of admitting the reading of the LXX., yet understand the passage as referring to that very event, which their version expresses: so that, it is plain, nothing can be more suitable to the context.\u201d Thus understood, the prophet\u2019s words were calculated to awaken the Israelites to a serious belief of this threatening, as they reminded them that God had inflicted the same judgment upon the Canaanites, and for the same sins of which they were guilty: and therefore gave them reason to apprehend, according to the prediction of Moses, that as they committed the same abominations, the land would <i>spew them out as it spewed out the nations <\/i>,which were before them. <\/p>,",
