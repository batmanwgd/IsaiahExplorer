Even as the names of persons in the Babylon category are cut off from the earth (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxNzk1MV0seyIxODYzMyI6Mn1d\">Isaiah 14:22; 48:18-19 <\/a>), so the names of those in the Perdition category are cut off from the earth and from eternity (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgxNDQiOjJ9LFsxODQwOV1d\">Isaiah 26:13-14; 38:18 <\/a>). Consistent with ascent to higher states of blessedness, on the other hand, Jehovah&rsquo;s servants receive a new name and a higher spiritual commission (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODQ0N10seyIxODc1OCI6NH0sWzE4OTQ1XV0=\">Isaiah 40:26; 56:4-7; 66:22 <\/a>). <\/p> ",
