    "html": " <p> Isaiah makes numerous references to Israel's sinful state\u2014her people are spiritually deaf and blind (mentioned four times), they have sinned, they did not walk in God's ways, and they were disobedient to his law. Therefore, the Lord permitted them to be robbed, spoiled, snared, thrown in prison, and burned\u2014all these having reference to Israel's captivity by other nations.<\/p> <p>After Isaiah declares the blindness of Israel, he provides hope by prophesying that Jesus Christ, who is the servant and messenger, will \"open the eyes of the blind,\" so that \"they shall be made perfect notwithstanding their blindness, if they will hearken unto\" the Lord. This prophecy may also find fulfillment in those who go forth as Christ's servants\u2014including Isaiah and others\u2014bringing the light of truth to the world.<\/p> <blockquote> <i>Hear,<\/i> ye <u>deaf<\/u>;     <br>and <i>look,<\/i> ye <u>blind<\/u>,     <br>that ye may see.
