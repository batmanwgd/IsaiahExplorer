Each view has the support of commentators. The last seems beyond question most in harmony with the context. Ineffective struggles for preservation naturally suggest the parallel, \u201clike some strong swimmer in his agony\u201d (<a class=\"ref\">Psalms 69:1-2; Psalms 69:14<\/a>). In the second clause there is, of course, no reason for doubt. It is Jehovah who \u201cbrings down the pride\u201d of the guilty nation.<\/p>",
