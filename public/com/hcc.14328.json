    "html": "<p><i>Eunuchs.<\/i>  It was ignominious to have no children among the Jews, as the propagation of the true religion depended much on their numbers.  But now, since the Church is gathered from all nations, virginity is preferable to marriage, and those who keep the <i>sabbath,<\/i> or all the commandments, and <i>choose<\/i> this state freely, will receive greater glory than the other <i>sons and daughters of <\/i>God.  Against this plain meaning, P. Martyr (de C\u0153lib.) asserts that God prefers eunuchs only because before those who transgress the law.  But he gives them <i>a place better<\/i> than his other <i>sons,<\/i> &c.!  Protestants (Bib. 1603) understand that eunuchs <i>shall be called after<\/i> (or according to) <i>God's people, and be of the same religion,<\/i> which implies no preference at all.  They add, therefore, <i>yea, under Christ the dignity of the faithful shall be greater than the Jews were at that time;<\/i> as if the comparison were between God's servants before and after Christ, and not between eunuchs and such as have children.  How much better is it for us to follow the holy Fathers, who hence commend those who make a vow of perpetual chastity?  They shall possess an excellent dignity among the angels.  (St. Basil, virg.) --- The rewards of continency are great, <i>eximia.<\/i>  (St. Cyril of Alexandria, hic.) --- \"In the eternal mansion they are preferred before children.\"  (St. Gregory, past. iii. 29., &c.)  (Worthington) --- Such spiritual eunuchs, as St. John the evangelist, are meant.  \"He hath chosen what the Lord would, that he should offer more than was commanded....He who is an eunuch, and performs all that is prescribed, shall have....the best place, so that he shall be a tower, and occupy the rank of a priest, and instead of children of the flesh, shall have many spiritual children.\"  (St. Jerome)  (Haydock) --- The law excluded eunuchs from the Church, Deuteronomy xxiii. 1.  But under the gospel, they may enter heaven, Matthew xix., and 1 Corinthians vii. 32., &c.  Daniel (i. 3.) and his companions were eunuchs, yet in high estimation; and virtuous eunuchs are commended, Wisdom iii. 13.  (Calmet) --- <i>Choose.<\/i>  Observing the commandments and counsels, like religious men.  (Menochius) --- Those who <i>choose<\/i> to do more than is commanded, will have a greater reward.  (Worthington)<\/p>",
