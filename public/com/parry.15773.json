    "html": " <i>tent\/curtains\/cords\/stakes.<\/i> The <i>tent<\/i> is reminiscent of the tabernacle of Moses, a tent to which all Israel was invited to come. The word <i>stakes<\/i> here is the source of the latter-day ecclesiastical division of the Church called a stake. Tent stakes (or pegs) help hold up and enlarge the tent of Zion. Each stake must be strong to keep the tent stable. The five command forms in this verse\u2014<i>enlarge,<\/i> <i>stretch<\/i> <i>forth,<\/i> <i>spare not,<\/i> <i>lengthen,<\/i> and <i>strengthen<\/i> (see also <a class=\"ref\">Moro. 10:31; D&amp;C 133:9<\/a>)\u2014teach us what we should be doing to build Zion in these last days. One way that Zion will enlarge her tent and strengthen her stakes is to practice the law of consecration (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 82:12-15<\/a>). <\/p> <p>President Ezra Taft Benson wrote: \"To members, the term <i>stake<\/i> is a symbolic expression. Picture in your mind a great tent held up by cords extended to many stakes that are firmly secured in the ground. The prophets likened latter-day Zion to a great tent encompassing the earth. That tent was supported by cords fastened to stakes [see <a class=\"ref\">3 Ne. 22:2<\/a>; <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzI2XQ==\">Isa. 54:2<\/a>]. Those stakes, of course, are various geographical organizations spread out over the earth. Presently Israel is being gathered to the various stakes of Zion.\" <\/p> ",
