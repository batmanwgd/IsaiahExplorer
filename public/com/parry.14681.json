The<i> escaped of Israel<\/i> will consist of both Jews and other members of the house of Israel (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 133:11-13<\/a>). <\/p> <p><i>holy.<\/i> The Hebrew term translated as \"holy\" has the root meaning of \"temple.\" Isaiah is saying, in essence, that those who \"remain in Jerusalem shall be called a temple people,\" presumably because they worship in the temple. The group becomes <i>holy<\/i> because of the cleansing\/purging process identified by Isaiah as the \"spirit of judgment\" and the \"spirit of burning\" (4:4). Also, God is called Holy One (41:14; <a class=\"ref\">1 Jn. 2:20<\/a>) in the last days, those in Zion will be like God in their holiness.<\/p> <p><i>written among the living.<\/i> The primary object of this phrase seems to be those who are counted among the mortal living. Temporally, those who survived the judgments identified in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzM3XQ==\">Isa. 3<\/a> will be <i>among the living.<\/i> The phrase may also refer to the book of life, speaking spiritually of those who are written in the Lamb's book of life and who will go to God's kingdom of heaven (<a class=\"ref\">Dan. 12:1; Philip. 4:3<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\">Rev. 20:15<\/a>). <\/p> ",
