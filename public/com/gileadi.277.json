But there, too, they &ldquo;find no rest&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxNzc3MCwxNzgzMF0seyIxODc4NiI6Mn1d\">Isaiah 5:30; 8:22; 57:20-21 <\/a>). Jehovah&rsquo;s stretching his <em>hand <\/em> over the Sea betokens the king of Assyria\/Babylon&rsquo;s destruction of Tyre, or that aspect of Greater Babylon which Tyre represents. Secondarily, drawing on the type of Moses&rsquo; stretching his hand over the Sea (<a class=\"ref\">Exodus 14:15-31 <\/a>), it alludes to the power of Jehovah&rsquo;s servant to ultimately put down the archtyrant&mdash;the <em>Sea <\/em> (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3OTAwXQ==\">Isaiah 11:15 <\/a>). Common harlot imagery identifies Tyre with Babylon, who rules as &ldquo;Mistress of Kingdoms&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODYwMSI6MTV9\">Isaiah 47:1-15 <\/a>). <\/p> ",
