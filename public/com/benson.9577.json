Those who, by their office and character, ought to have stood up in defence of oppressed truth and righteousness, even they, contrary to what might have been justly expected, betrayed so good a cause, or had not the courage to defend it. So that it was time for God to interpose, and to appear in defence of his own honour and people.\u201d <i>Therefore my own arm, <\/i>,&c.\u2014See note on <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODE3XQ==\">Isaiah 59:16 <\/a>. <i>And my fury, it upheld me <\/i>\u2014Or, <i>my zeal <\/i>,rather, namely, against the adversaries of my church, and for the deliverance of my people: I was resolved to vindicate my own honour, and my concern for my people made me go through with the undertaking in spite of all opposition.
