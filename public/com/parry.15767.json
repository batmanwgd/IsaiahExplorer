    "html": " <i>pleased the Lord to bruise him.<\/i> Certainly the Father took no pleasure from the suffering of his Son. But the Father was pleased that his Son would obediently offer such a sacrifice, meaning the sacrifice was according to the Father's wishes and his will. The Father was pleased further because of the love manifest by his Son and also because of the blessings that would come to the rest of his children.<\/p> <p> <i>he shall see his seed.<\/i> Abinadi interpreted this expression in <a class=\"ref\">Mosiah 15:10-13<\/a>, saying that the seed of Christ are the righteous who have heard the good word of salvation and believed and obeyed: \"These are his seed, or they are the heirs of the kingdom of God. For these are they whose sins he has borne; these are they for whom he has died, to redeem them from their transgressions.\" Elsewhere we learn that the seed of Christ are those who are \"spiritually begotten\" as his sons and daughters (<a class=\"ref\">Mosiah 5:7<\/a>), born of water and the Spirit (<a class=\"ref\">Moses 6:64-68<\/a>). Beginning with this expression, we move from Isaiah's prophecy of the Lord's suffering to his prophecy of the Lord's triumph.<\/p> <p><i>prolong his days.<\/i> This expression means to lengthen his life. Isaiah has already written that Christ would be killed (\"cut off out of the land of the living\"); now he says Christ will have a long and prosperous life. This paradox contains a wonderful gospel truth: The righteous who die will enjoy a life of glory that never ends.<\/p> <p><i>pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand.<\/i> Christ will exercise his agency to truly fulfill all the will of the Father.<\/p> ",
