(NJV)<\/p> <\/blockquote><p>In verse 11, the foolish nobles of Tanis (or of Zoan in KJV, the ancient capital of the delta) are absurd enough to claim to be sons of the Kedemite kings, who lived east in the Arabian desert and were renowned for their wisdom. (See <a class=\"ref\">1 Kgs. 4:30-31<\/a>.) The nobles of Memphis (or Noph, KJV; the traditional capital of all northern or lower Egypt) are also deluded and lead all of Egypt astray (v. 13). Indeed, the whole society, whether of high station or low (symbolized by the palm branch and papyrus reed, respectively), will achieve nothing (v. 15).<\/p> <p>As with earlier parts of this chapter, it is difficult to establish a precise historical context for the fulfillment of these words. By the time of Isaiah, Egypt was well into a period of political decline that later resulted in repetitive conquests by various empires. Not until the twentieth century did the Egyptians completely regain their lost independence, but even now they require foreign aid for the people and expertise for the industries. Sometimes the foreign powers and their advisors have hindered more than helped Egypt. Perhaps, again, a modern fulfillment of this prophecy is as likely as any other.<\/p>",
