The expressions are noble, and contain a lively description of that terror which the appearance of a hostile army strikes into the beholders. <i>They come from a far country <\/i>\u2014 Many of Cyrus\u2019s auxiliary forces came from very distant countries: see <a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 50:41; Jeremiah 51:27-28<\/a>. The prophet adds this as an aggravation of the judgment. <i>From the end of heaven \u2014 <\/i>This is not to be understood strictly and properly, but popularly and hyperbolically, as such expressions are commonly used, both in sacred and profane authors. <i>Even the Lord, <\/i><i>and the weapons of his indignation <\/i>\u2014 The Medes and Persians, who were but a rod in God\u2019s hand, and the instruments of his anger, as was said of the Assyrian, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTc4NTY=\">Isaiah 10:5<\/a>. <i>To destroy the whole land <\/i>\u2014 Namely, of Babylon, of which he is now speaking.<\/p>",
