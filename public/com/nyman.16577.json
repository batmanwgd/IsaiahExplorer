    "html": "          <p>There are two admonitions in this verse: the Lord's people are instructed to depart from evil, and those who \"bear the vessels of the Lord\" (the watchmen or preachers of the gospel) are instructed to be clean. The place from which they are to depart is \"Babylon\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 133:5<\/a>)-that is, \"from the midst of wickedness, which is spiritual Babylon\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 133:14<\/a>; see also 38:42). The process of becoming clean is shown in <a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 133:6<\/a>: the Saints are to call solemn assemblies, teach each other, and call upon the name of the Lord. This verse in Isaiah is often quoted by modern Church leaders as an admonition to priesthood holders and Church members to live high moral standards. Paul paraphrased it in writing to the Corinthians with the same objective (see <a class=\"ref\">2 Cor. 6:17<\/a>). The book of Revelation speaks of the fall of Babylon in the same time period as does Isaiah (see chapter 9 of this book), and also invites the Lord's people to come out of Babylon (see <a class=\"ref\">Rev. 18:4<\/a>).<\/p>     ",
