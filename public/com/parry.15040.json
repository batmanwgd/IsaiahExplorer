These descendants gave their name to Dumah, capital of a district known as Jawf, about halfway across northern Arabia between Palestine and southern Babylonia. A second possible application for <i>Dumah<\/i> may indicate the silence that follows destruction, for the Hebrew word means \"silence.\"<\/p> <p><i>He calleth to me out of Seir.<\/i> One of Seir's inhabitants called to Isaiah, \"Watchman, what of the night?\" <i>Seir<\/i> refers to Edom's land and people and is a symbol of worldliness (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 1:36<\/a>). <\/p> <p> <i>Watchman, what of the night? <\/i>This phrase is repeated for emphasis. An individual asks of the watchman (Isaiah), \"What remains of the night [apostasy and darkness] before the morning light [truth, gospel] arises?\" Isaiah responds with, \"In the morning you will receive light followed by further darkness [night].\" Isaiah is the watchman in this context, but compare with 21:6.<\/p> ",
