Although Nephi does not identify this passage as a quotation from Isaiah, he does indicate clearly that it is a statement of the Lord. The principle of revelation taught in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTc0XQ==\">Isaiah 28:9<\/a> is also amplified in <a class=\"ref\">2 Ne. 28:30-31<\/a>. The Lord gives us revelation; as we accept and live by that revelation, we are given more revelation, but if we do not accept what is revealed, we lose the knowledge we have already gained.<\/p>     ",
