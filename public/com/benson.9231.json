Nay, even when thou dost actually smite and punish them, they are guilty of the same obstinate blindness as when thou dost only threaten them, shutting their eyes against the clearest convictions of guilt and wrath, and ascribing to chance, common fate, or second causes, what is manifestly a divine correction and rebuke. They regard not the symptoms of their own ruin, but cry, \u201cPeace, peace,\u201d when thou, the holy and righteous God, art waging war against them. <i>But they shall see<\/i>\u2014Whether they will or not. They shall know and feel, and that by sad experience, what they would not learn by other and easier ways. Atheists, scorners, and the carnally secure shall shortly feel what now they will not believe, that<i>it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God. <\/i> They will not see the evil of sin, and particularly the sin of hating and persecuting the people of God; but they shall, at length, be convinced to their sorrow, by the tokens of God\u2019s displeasure against them for it, that what is done against his people, God takes as done against himself. <i>And be ashamed for their envy at the people<\/i>\u2014They shall see that they have done God\u2019s people a great deal of wrong, and therefore shall be ashamed of it, and of the enmity and envy which produced it. <i>Yea, the fire of thine enemies,<\/i> &c.\u2014Such fire or wrath as thou usest to pour forth upon thy implacable enemies.<\/p> ",
