A child can number or count but few; yet the number of those who would be left, would be so very small that even a child could count them with ease. It is probable that a few of the army of Sennacherib escaped (see the note at<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MzkwXQ==\">Isaiah 37:37<\/a>); and compared with the whole army, the remnant might bear a striking resemblance to the few decaying trees of a once magnificent forest of cedars.<\/p> ",
