We frequently hear the words \"a marvelous work and a wonder,\" \"a book that is sealed,\" and \"three witnesses\" in Sunday School classes or from the pulpit. All of these phrases are from <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isa. 29<\/a> (JST, KJV). This chapter provides many details about the book of scripture that is the keystone of our religion. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isa. 29<\/a> was written some twenty-seven hundred years ago for us as a witness of the Book of Mormon.<\/i><\/p> ",
