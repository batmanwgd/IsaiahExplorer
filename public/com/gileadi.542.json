    "html": " <p>Isaiah&rsquo;s chiastic pattern of thirty alternating chaos and creation motifs in chapters 41-46 ends by synonymously paralleling the &ldquo;bird of prey&rdquo; who comes from the east with the person who exemplifies <em>righteousness <\/em> who comes from the east (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDU0LDE4NDc3XQ==\">Isaiah 41:2, 25 <\/a>), showing they are one and the same. A doubling of directionals, moreover, shows that when &ldquo;the man who performs my counsel&rdquo; arrives from a &ldquo;distant land&rdquo; or a &ldquo;land far off&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NTk4XQ==\">v 11 <\/a>), Jehovah&rsquo;s <em>righteousness <\/em> is no longer &ldquo;far off&rdquo; but is &ldquo;brought near&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NjAwXQ==\">v 13 <\/a>), confirming the bird of prey&rsquo;s identity as <em>righteousness <\/em>&mdash;Jehovah&rsquo;s end-time servant. <\/p> <p>Those who are far from personal righteousness must emulate one who personifies <em>righteousness <\/em> so that Jehovah&mdash;who personifies <em>salvation <\/em>&mdash;may come and dwell among them (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODg2NSI6M30=\">Isaiah 62:10-12 <\/a>). As the time is short, however, for those &ldquo;stubborn-hearted&rdquo; who still cling to their idols (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODU4OCI6OX0=\">vv 1-9 <\/a>) there exists but one of two possibilities: &ldquo;From the west men will fear Jehovah Omnipotent and from the rising of the sun his glory. For he will come [upon them] like a hostile torrent impelled by the Spirit of Jehovah. But he will come as Redeemer to Zion, to those of Jacob who repent of transgression&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODgyMCI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 59:19-20 <\/a>). <\/p> ",
