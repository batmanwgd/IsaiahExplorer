Jehovah of hosts musters an army, those that have come out of a distant land, from the end of the heaven: Jehovah and His instruments of wrath, to destroy the whole earth.\u201d<\/em> <em> Ko\u0304l <\/em> commences an interjectional sentence, and thus becomes almost an interjection itself (compare <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzA1LDE4OTI5XQ==\">Isaiah 52:8; Isaiah 66:6<\/a>, and on <a class=\"ref\">Genesis 4:10<\/a>). There is rumbling on the mountains (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzk5NiI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 17:12-13<\/a>), for there are the peoples of Eran, and in front the Medes inhabiting the mountainous north-western portion of Eran, who come across the lofty <em> Shahu<\/em> (<em> Zagros<\/em> ), and the ranges that lie behind it towards the Tigris, and descend upon the lowlands of Babylon; and not only the peoples of Eran, but the peoples of the mountainous north of Asia generally (<a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 51:27<\/a>) - an army under the guidance of Jehovah, the God of hosts of spirits and stars, whose wrath it will execute over the whole earth, i.e., upon the world-empire; for the fall of Babel is a judgment, and accompanied with judgments upon all the tribes under Babylonian rule.<\/p>",
