    "title": "Babylon Shall Be Destroyed",
    "html": " <p> These verses have a dual meaning, referring both to the ancient kingdom of Babylon and to the wicked kingdom of the world. As Babylon was thrown down by God's power anciently, so will the world be destroyed in the end. Babylon's fate will take the people of Babylon (both the temporal and the spiritual Babylon) by surprise: \"Thou saidst, I shall be a lady for ever\" (47:7). The destruction will come suddenly, \"in a moment in one day,\" and it will be complete\u2014\"they shall come upon thee in their perfection\" (47:9). And what are Babylon's sins? She is \"given to pleasures\" (47:8); she has \"trusted in [her] wickedness\" (47:10); she has been \"perverted\" by her \"wisdom\" and \"knowledge\" (47:10); and she has rejected the true God, saying in her heart, \"I am, and none else beside me\" (47:8, 10).<\/p> <p>When the day of destruction comes, Babylon turns to her \"enchantments,\" \"sorceries,\" and \"astrologers\" for help (47:12-13)\u2014the wisdom and power of the devil and his deceptions\u2014but they will all fail her (47:14, 15).<\/p> <p>It is interesting to note here that Babylon is consistently depicted as feminine\u2014 Lady Babylon, the embodiment of all evil\u2014in direct opposition to Lady Zion, the embodiment of all that is good. Many terms in this passage present Babylon as feminine: \"virgin\" (47:1), \"daughter\" (47:1, 5), \"tender and delicate\" (47:1), \"locks\" (47:2), \"lady\" (47:5, 7), \"widow\" (47:8, 9). Compare these with the depiction of Lady Babylon in Revelation, who is called \"whore\" (17:1, 15, 16), \"woman\" (17:3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 18), \"mother of harlots\" (17:5), \"queen\" (18:7), and \"widow\" (18:7).<\/p> <p>Why does the Lord use feminine symbols in this way? Perhaps it is because he regards righteous woman as the epitome of his creation, which makes the corrupted woman more abhorrent by contrast. Also, the holy woman, as partner in the process of procreation, is essential for the perpetuation of God's plan. The evil woman not only brings herself to destruction but also frustrates the plan itself.<\/p> <blockquote> Come down, and <i>sit in the dust<\/i>, O virgin <u>daughter of Babylon<\/u>,     <br><i>sit on the ground<\/i>: there is no throne, O <u>daughter of the Chaldeans<\/u>:     <br>for thou shalt no more be called <i>tender<\/i> and <i>delicate<\/i>. (47:1)     <br>Take the millstones,     <br>and grind meal:     <br><i>uncover <\/i><u>thy locks<\/u>, make <i>bare <\/i><u>the leg<\/u>,     <br><i>uncover <\/i><u>the thigh<\/u>, pass over the rivers. (47:2)     <br>Thy <i>nakedness <\/i><u>shall be uncovered<\/u>,     <br>yea, thy <i>shame <\/i><u>shall be seen<\/u>:     <br>I will take vengeance, and I will not meet thee as a man. (47:3)     <br>As for our <i>redeemer<\/i>,     <br>the <i>Lord of hosts<\/i> is his name,     <br>the <i>Holy One of Israel<\/i>. (47:4)     <br>Sit thou <u>silent<\/u>, and get thee into darkness, O<i> daughter of the Chaldeans<\/i>:     <br>for thou shalt <u>no more be called<\/u>, The <i>lady of kingdoms<\/i>. (47:5)     <br><i>I was wroth<\/i> with <u>my people<\/u>,     <br><i>I have polluted<\/i> <u>mine inheritance<\/u>, and given them into thine hand:     <br>thou didst [show] them <i>no mercy<\/i>;     <br>upon the ancient hast thou very <i>heavily laid<\/i> <i>thy yoke<\/i>. (47:6)     <br>And thou saidst, I shall be a lady for ever:     <br>so that thou <i>didst not lay<\/i> <u>these things<\/u> <i>to thy heart<\/i>,     <br><i>neither didst remember<\/i> the latter end of <u>it<\/u>. (47:7)     <br>Therefore hear now this, thou that art <i>given to pleasures<\/i>,     <br>that <i>dwellest carelessly<\/i>,     <br>that sayest in thine heart,     <br><i>I am<\/i>,     <br>and <i>none else beside me<\/i>;     <br><i>I shall not sit<\/i> as <u>a widow<\/u>,     <br><i>neither shall I know<\/i> the <u>loss of children<\/u>: (47:8)     <br>But these <i>two things<\/i> shall come to thee in a moment in one day,     <br>the<i> loss of children<\/i>, and <i>widowhood<\/i>:     <br>they shall come upon thee in their perfection for the <i>multitude <\/i><u>of thy sorceries<\/u>,     <br>and for the <i>great abundance <\/i><u>of thine enchantments<\/u>. (47:9)     <br>For thou hast trusted in thy wickedness: <i>thou hast said<\/i>, <u>None seeth me<\/u>.     <br>Thy wisdom and thy knowledge, it hath perverted thee;     <br>and <i>thou hast said<\/i> in thine heart, <u>I am<\/u>,<u> and none else beside me<\/u>. (47:10)     <br>Therefore shall <i>evil<\/i> come upon thee; <i>thou shalt not know<\/i> from whence it riseth:     <br>and <i>mischief<\/i> shall fall upon thee; <i>thou shalt not be able<\/i> to put it off:     <br>and <i>desolation<\/i> shall come upon thee suddenly, which <i>thou shalt not know<\/i>. (47:11)     <br>Stand now with <i>thine<\/i> <u>enchantments<\/u>,     <br>and with the multitude of <i>thy<\/i> <u>sorceries<\/u>, wherein thou hast laboured from thy youth;     <br>if so be <i>thou<\/i> shalt <u>be able to profit<\/u>,     <br>if so be <i>thou<\/i> <u>mayest prevail<\/u>. (47:12)     <br>Thou art wearied in the multitude of thy <i>counsels<\/i>.     <br>Let now the <i>astrologers<\/i>, the <i>stargazers<\/i>, the monthly <i>prognosticators<\/i>, stand up, and save thee from these things that shall come upon thee. (47:13)     <br>Behold, <i>they<\/i> shall be as <u>stubble<\/u>;     <br>the <u>fire<\/u> shall burn <i>them<\/i>;     <br>they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the <i>flame<\/i>:     <br>there shall not be a <i>coal<\/i> <u>to warm at<\/u>,     <br>nor <i>fire<\/i> <u>to sit before it<\/u>.
