    "html": " <p><i>Babylon is not only an ancient, powerful nation but a symbol of the wicked world in all ages. In our time, the last days, she reigns supreme, and many swear allegiance to her, loving the praise and comforts and riches of the worldly life. Ancient Babylon thought she was invincible, as does the modern incarnation. But suddenly, without warning, the Babylon of the last days will be thrown down, as was ancient Babylon, and all those who ally themselves to her will be destroyed with the world they loved so much.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>This is a prophecy many of us may see come to pass in our time, some in horror and some in gratitude. The destruction of powerful Babylon can be a reminder to us to trust in the Lord and in nothing else.<b> <\/b>The Lord will be patient. He will refine us in the furnace of affliction. And he will give us prophets, to guide us and teach us truth. Those who hearken will enjoy unceasing peace and righteousness and will receive of the blessings of Abraham. To come to such peace, we must repent and flee from Babylon\u2014 the world and its pride and sinfulness.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>The prophecies in this chapter apply both to the fall of the ancient kingdom of Babylon and to the fall of the wicked world in the last days.<\/i><\/p> ",
