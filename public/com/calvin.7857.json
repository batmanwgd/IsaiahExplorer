He now applies to his purpose what was contained in his discourse concerning the infinite goodness of God, and shows that his thoughts are very unlike the thoughts of men. And the true way of teaching is this, that we should apply general statements for present use. Finally, he treats of the restoration of the people, which depended on the undeserved mercy of God. <\/p> \n <p> <i>The mountains and hills shall break out before you. <\/i> By \u201cthe mountains and hills\u201d he means that everything which they shall meet in the journey, though in other respects it be injurious, shall aid those who shall return to Jerusalem. They are metaphors, by which he shows that all the creatures bow to the will of God, and rejoice and lend their aid to carry on his work. He alludes to the deliverance from Egypt, (<a class=\"ref\">Exodus 14:22 <\/a>) as is customary with the Prophets; for thus is it described by the Psalmist, \u201cThe mountains leaped like rams, and the hills like lambs. What ailed thee, O sea, that thou fleddest, and Jordan, (<a class=\"ref\">Joshua 3:16 <\/a>) that thou wast driven back? (<a class=\"ref\">Psalms 114:4 <\/a>) For the restoration of the Church may be regarded as a renovation of the whole world, and in consequence of this, heaven and earth are said to be changed, as if their order were reversed. But all this depended on former predictions, by which they had received a promise of their return. <\/p> ",
