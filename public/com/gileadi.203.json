Although he gained the whole world, it profited him nothing as he suffers the loss of his own soul (cf. <a class=\"ref\">Matthew 16:26<\/a>). Instead of being a power of creation&mdash;a god who benefits humanity&mdash;he is a power of chaos who orchestrates horrific destruction of life and property. He who made the earth &ldquo;shake&rdquo; and kingdoms &ldquo;quake&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 5:25; 24:18; 54:10<\/a>), who turned the world into a &ldquo;wilderness&rdquo; and demolished its &ldquo;cities&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 7:20-25; 32:19; 64:10-11<\/a>), has become an object of derision.<\/p>",
