    "html": "<p>The idea of a person who doesn&rsquo;t grow dim or bruised alludes to the servant&rsquo;s attaining seraph status, as did Moses, whose &ldquo;his eye was not dim nor his natural force abated,&rdquo; when, at the age of a hundred-and-twenty, he passed on from among his people (<a class=\"ref\">Deuteronomy 34:7<\/a>). Like Moses, the servant is a lawgiver to Jehovah&rsquo;s people among the nations: &ldquo;Give ear and come unto me; pay heed, that your souls may live! And I will make with you an everlasting covenant: [my] loving fidelity toward David. See, I have appointed him as a witness to the nations, a prince and lawgiver of the peoples&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg3NDQiOjJ9XQ==\">Isaiah 55:3-4<\/a>).<\/p>",
