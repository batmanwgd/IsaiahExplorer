    "html": " <i>Ho.<\/i> This interjection is an exclamation to capture attention. A modern-day equivalent might be \"Hey!\"<\/p> <p><i>thirsteth\/waters.<\/i> These are the living <i>waters<\/i> of the gospel (<a class=\"ref\">John 4:10<\/a>). This promise is echoed in the Gospel of John, in which the apostle recorded Jesus as saying, \"If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink\" (<a class=\"ref\">John 7:37; Rev. 21:6<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\"> 22:17<\/a>). The living water is also the love of God (<a class=\"ref\">1 Ne. 11:25<\/a>). Ultimately, it is also Jesus Christ and his atonement, the only true source of life eternal. One place where the water can be found, as deep in a well, is the \"mysteries of [the] kingdom\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 63:23; Rev. 22:17<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 133:29<\/a>), a key to which is given in the temple.<\/p> <p><i>no money\/buy, and eat\/without money and without price.<\/i> We need pay no earthly price to receive the blessings of the gospel and the atonement of Christ. Yet there is a price that God requires: a broken heart and a contrite spirit (<a class=\"ref\">2 Ne. 2:7; 3 Ne. 9:20<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 59:8<\/a>; see commentary on 52:3, <i>redeemed without money<\/i>).<\/p> <p><i>wine\/milk.<\/i> Those who are thirsty are offered living water, and <i>wine<\/i> and <i>milk<\/i> besides. \"The feast is one of love and forgiveness. The abundance and freeness of the water of refreshment (44:3), the wine of joy (25:6-8) and the milk of richness (<a class=\"ref\">Ex. 3:8<\/a>) and supremacy (60:16) is figurative of the Lord's salvation.\" <\/p> ",
