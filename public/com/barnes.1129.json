    "html": "<p><em>And the inhabitant<\/em>&mdash;The dwellers generally.<\/p><p><em>Of this isle<\/em>&mdash;The word \u05d0\u05d9 &lsquo;iy &ldquo;isle&rdquo; is used here in the sense of &ldquo;coast, or maritime&rdquo; country, and is evidently applied to Palestine, or the land of Canaan, which is a narrow coast lying on the Mediterranean. That the word is often used in this sense, and may be applied to a maritime country, see the notes at <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc5MjkiOjF9LHsiMTg0NTMiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 13:22; Isaiah 41:1<\/a>. The connection here requires us to understand it of Palestine.<\/p><p><em>Shall say...<\/em>&mdash;Shall condemn their own folly in trusting in Egypt, and seeking deliverance there.<\/p><p><em>And how shall we escape?<\/em>&mdash;They shall be alarmed for their own safety, for the very nation on which they had relied had been made captive. And when the &ldquo;stronger&rdquo; had been subdued, how could the feeble and dependent escape a similar overthrow and captivity? All this was designed to show them the folly of trusting in the aid of another nation, and to lead them to put confidence in the God of their fathers.<\/p>",
