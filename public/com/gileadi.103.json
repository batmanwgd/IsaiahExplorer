    "html": "<p>Isaiah&rsquo;s &ldquo;seeing&rdquo; Jehovah (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTAxXQ==\">v 5<\/a>) and &ldquo;hearing&rdquo; his voice follows the pattern of a prophet seeing and hearing what God reveals to him in a vision (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODA0MiI6NX0=\">Isaiah 21:6-10<\/a>). As Isaiah is healed of covenant curses through the atonement symbolized by the Altar of Atonement, moreover, so Jehovah himself is the author of that atonement: &ldquo;Yet he bore our sufferings, endured our griefs, though we thought him stricken, smitten of God, and humbled. But he was pierced for our transgressions, crushed because of our iniquities; the price of our peace he incurred, and with his wounds we are healed&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODcxNiI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 53:4-5<\/a>).<\/p><p><em>Here am I; send me!<\/em> Now that Isaiah can again speak&mdash;and desiring to do for his people as has been done for him&mdash;he gladly accepts Jehovah&rsquo;s prophetic commission to minister to his people. The verb &ldquo;send&rdquo; (<em>salah<\/em>) has the same Hebrew root as the noun &ldquo;apostle&rdquo; (<em>saliah<\/em>), signifying one who is &ldquo;sent&rdquo; to bear witness of what he has seen and heard. Although Jehovah personally commissions Isaiah, others have a vested interest in Isaiah&rsquo;s fulfilling his prophetic ministry: the words &ldquo;Who will go for <em>us<\/em>?&rdquo; signifies that heaven will minister to Isaiah even as Isaiah ministers to Jehovah&rsquo;s people.<\/p>",
