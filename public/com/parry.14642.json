Inasmuch as the children of Israel saturate their lives with sins (as Isaiah suggests in the terms <i>replenished<\/i> and <i>full,<\/i> used several times) and fail to hearken to the voice of many prophets by repenting and turning to God, Isaiah can deliver his plea (prayer) before the Lord: <i>Forgive them not.<\/i><\/p> <p> Isaiah has testified against Israel, and now, according to the custom of the court, the judge will deliver his sentence. In this case, the judgment will be delivered by Jesus Christ during the \"day of Jehovah\" (2:12).<\/p> ",
