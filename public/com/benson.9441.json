But, as the name of David is sometimes given to his successors, and particularly to Christ, <a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 30:9; Ezekiel 34:23; Hosea 3:5 <\/a>,, and the name of Isaac is given to his posterity, <a class=\"ref\">Amos 7:9 <\/a>; so here the name of Israel may not unfitly be given to Christ, not only because he descended from his loins, but also, because he was the true and the great Israel, who, in a more eminent manner, prevailed with God, as that name signifies; of whom Jacob, who was first called Israel, was but a type. And as the name of Christ, the head, is sometimes given to his body, the church, as <a class=\"ref\">1 Corinthians 12:12 <\/a>,, so it is not strange if, on the contrary, the name of Israel, which properly belongs to the church, be given to Christ, the head of it. The words, however, may be rendered, <i>Thou art my servant, unto, in, <\/i>,or <i>for Israel, <\/i>,that is, to bring them back unto me, from whom they have revolted; or <i>Israel is he in whom I will be glorified by thee. <\/i> <\/p>,",
