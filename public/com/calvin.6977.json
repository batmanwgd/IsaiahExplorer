    "html": " <p> <i>Manasseh, Ephraim. <\/i> These tribes were closely related to each other; for besides their being descended from the same ancestor, Abraham, a close relationship arose out of their being descended from one patriarch, his grandson, Joseph. (<a class=\"ref\">Genesis 41:50 <\/a>.) But though they were closely allied, still God threatens that he will cause them to destroy themselves by mutual conflict, as if they were devouring the flesh of their own arm, and, consequently, that there will be no need of foreign enemies. He likewise adds that, after having wearied themselves out by mutual wounds, both will unite against Judah, in order to destroy it. <\/p> \n <p> <i>And for all this his anger shall not be turned away. <\/i> If any one take into consideration those calamities which Isaiah threatened, he will be amazed and greatly astonished that still more severe chastisements are foretold. But in this manner God acts towards the wicked, and does not cease to afflict till he utterly overwhelm and destroy them, when, after having been frequently invited, they refuse to be reconciled to him. We need not wonder, therefore, that he inflicts stroke after stroke, as he also foretold by Moses that he would <i>punish seven times more <\/i> (<a class=\"ref\">Leviticus 26:18 <\/a>), and <i>bring seven times more plagues upon <\/i> (<a class=\"ref\">Leviticus 26:21 <\/a>) those who would not repent; lest they should think that, when they had been punished once or twice, they would not be punished again. <\/p> \n <p> <i>But his hand is stretched out still. <\/i> By this he means that rods are prepared, that he may immediately strike with them; for it is not with a woman\u2019s passion that the Lord is angry, but his wrath is immediately followed by revenge. <\/p> ",
