    "html": "<p><em>For thy waste and thy desolate places<\/em> &mdash;Thy land over which ruin has been spread, and ever which the exile nation mourns.<\/p><p><em>And the land of thy destruction<\/em> &mdash;That is, thy land laid in ruins. The construction is not uncommon where a noun is used to express the sense of an adjective. Thus in<a class=\"ref\">Psalm 2:6<\/a> , the Hebrew phrase (margin) is correctly rendered &lsquo;my holy hill.&rsquo; Here the sense is, that their entire country had been so laid waste as to be a land of desolation.<\/p><p><em>Shall even now be too narrow<\/em> &mdash;Shall be too limited to contain all who shall become converted to the true God. The contracted territory of Palestine shall be incapable of sustaining all who will acknowledge the true God, and who shall be regarded as his friends.<\/p><p><em>And they that swallowed thee up<\/em> &mdash;The enemies that laid waste thy land, and that &ldquo;absorbed,&rdquo; as it were, thy inhabitants, and removed them to a distant land. They shall be all gone, and the land shall smile again in prosperity and in loveliness.<\/p> ",
