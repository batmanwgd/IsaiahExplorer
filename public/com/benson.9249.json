Here it turns to the two tribes of Judah and Benjamin, the remnant of God\u2019s people, who were to continue a kingdom after the final captivity of the Israelites. It begins with a favourable prognostication of their affairs under Hezekiah: but soon changes to reproofs and threatenings, for their intemperance, disobedience, and profaneness.\u201d <i>In that day <\/i>\u2014When the kingdom of Israel shall be utterly destroyed; <i>the Lord of hosts shall be for a crown of glory, <\/i> &c.\u2014Shall give eminent glory and beauty <i>unto the residue of his people <\/i>\u2014Unto the kingdom of Judah, who shall continue in their own country, when Israel is carried into captivity. <i>And for a spirit of judgment, <\/i> &c.\u2014He explains how, or wherein, God would glorify and beautify them, even by giving wisdom to their rulers, and courage to their soldiers; which two things contribute much to the strength, safety, and glory of a nation. <i>To them that turn the battle to the gate <\/i>\u2014Who not only drive their enemies from their land, but pursue them into their own lands, and besiege them in their own cities. <\/p> ",
