If we, as members of the Lord's Church, hearken to his servants, we will have peace and righteousness as steady and consistent as a river and as the waves of a sea (48:18). We will be heirs to the Abrahamic promises: we will have descendants as numerous as the sands of the seashore, and an everlasting name before God (48:19).<\/p> <blockquote> [And] thus saith the <i>Lord,<\/i>     <br>thy<i> Redeemer,<\/i>     <br>the <i>Holy One of Israel;<\/i> [I have sent him,]     <br>&hellip;the<i> Lord <\/i>thy<i> God<\/i>     <br><i>[who] teacheth<\/i><u> thee to profit<\/u>,     <br><i>[who] leadeth<\/i><u> thee by the way<\/u><i>&hellip;<\/i>thou shouldst<i> go,<\/i> [hath done it].
