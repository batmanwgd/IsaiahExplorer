From Adam, their &ldquo;first father,&rdquo; to their present &ldquo;spokesmen&rdquo; or prophets, all have transgressed. If the Jacob\/Israel category persists in sinning, covenant curses such as profanation, ostracism, and execration will continue to follow them (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg4MTMiOjR9LHsiMTg4OTIiOjZ9XQ==\">Isaiah 59:12-15; 64:6-11 <\/a>). But if they repent, Jehovah will redeem them, enabling them to ascend to higher spiritual categories: &ldquo;He will come as Redeemer to Zion, to those of Jacob who repent of transgression&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODIxXQ==\">Isaiah 59:20 <\/a>). <\/p> ",
