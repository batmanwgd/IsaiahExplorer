Tertullian understands by the \u201cbruised reed\u201d (<i>arundinem contusam<\/i>) the faith of Israel, and by the \u201cglimmering wick\u201d (<i>linum ardens<\/i>) the momentary zeal of the Gentiles. But the words hardly admit of this distinction; the reference is rather a general one, to those whose inner and outer life is only hanging by a slender thread. In the statement that in such a case as this He does not completely break or extinguish, there is more implied than is really expressed. Not only will He not destroy the life that is dying out, but He will actually save it; His course is not to destroy, but to save. If we explain the words that follow as meaning, \u201cHe will carry out right to truth,\u201d i.e., to its fullest efficacy and permanence (lxx<span class=\"greek normal\"> \u03b5\u03b9\u0313\u03c2 \u03b1\u0313\u03bb\u03b7\u0301\u03b8\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1\u03bd<\/span> ; instead of which we find<span class=\"greek normal\"> \u03b5\u03b9\u0313\u03c2 \u03bd\u03b9\u0342\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2<\/span> , \u201cunto victory,\u201d in <a class=\"ref\">Matthew 12:20<\/a> ,<\/i><\/i><\/p><i><i>\n\n\n\n<\/i><\/i><p>(Note: \u201cAd victoriam enim kri'sin perducit qui ad veritatem perducit.\u201d - Anger.)<\/p> \n\n\n\n<p>as if the reading were<span class=\"normal hebrew\"> \u05dc\u05e0\u05e6\u05d7<\/span> , as in <a class=\"ref\">Habakkuk 1:4<\/a>), the connection between the first and last clauses of <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDg0XQ==\">Isaiah 42:3<\/a> is a very loose one.

It is on its subjective and practical side that truth is referred to here, viz., as denoting such a knowledge, and acknowledgement of the true facts in the complicated affairs of men, as will promote both equity and kindness. <br><\/p> ",
