    "html": "<p> (2) A grievous vision . . .\u2014The verse contains, as it were, the three tableaux that came in succession before the prophet\u2019s gaze: (1) The treacherous dealer, the Assyro-Chald\u00e6an power, spoiling and oppressing, breaking treaties, and, as its kings boasted (<a class=\"ref\">Habakkuk 2:5<\/a> ; Records of the Past, vii. 42, 44), \u201cremoving landmarks.\u201d (2) The summons to Elam and Media to put an end to this tyranny. (3) The oppressed peoples ceasing to sigh, and rejoicing in their liberation.<\/p> \n<p>Elam appears here as combined with Media, which is named in<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3OTI0XQ==\">Isaiah 13:17<\/a> as the only destroyer of Babylon, and this has been urged as evidence of a later date. As a matter of fact, however, Sargon at this very time was carrying on a fierce war against Elam (Records of the Past, cvii. 41-49) as well as against Media (ibid, p. 37). In<a class=\"ref\">Ezekiel 32:24<\/a> , Elam is numbered among the extinct nations, but the name, at all events, re-appears as applied to the Persians, though they were of a distinct race. It was, even as a mere forecast, perfectly natural that the two should be associated together as the future destroyers of the Nineveh and Babel empires, which to the prophet\u2019s eye were identical in character and policy. The advance described as \u201cfrom the wilderness\u201d implies a march of part at least of the Medo-Persian army down the Choaspes and into the lowland of Chuzistan, bordering on the great Arabian desert.<\/p> ",
