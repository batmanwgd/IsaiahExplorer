Chapters 7\u201312 show the consequences of Ahaz\u2019s refusal to trust God and his trusting the nations (in particular, Assyria) instead. The result was near destruction at the hands of the very nation he trusted. But the chapters conclude on a hopeful note, because God will not break his promise either to his people or to the house of David. He will send a Davidic Messiah to restore his people and rule them in peace and justice. Chapters 36\u201337 reverse the picture. Isaiah\u2019s prophecy has come true, and Judah has been devastated by Assyria. But Hezekiah, Ahaz\u2019s son, does put his trust in God and does not surrender to Assyria. As a result God proves his trustworthiness by keeping his word and delivering Judah from Sennacherib.<\/p>     <p>\u2003But the mirror image effect continues. Whereas chapters 7\u201312 began badly and ended well, chapters 36\u201339 begin well and end badly. Chapters 38\u201339, which are closely connected, depict a Hezekiah who is both mortal and fallible. This segment ends with the prediction of the Exile under Babylon, with Hezekiah\u2019s descendants in the Davidic dynasty serving the Babylonian king as eunuchs. What is going on? This question is intensified when we realize that the events in at least chapter 38 took place before the deliverance in 701 B.C. In other words, they have been pulled out of chronological order for some reason. What could the reason be?<\/p>     <p>\u2003Since the Scripture does not answer the question explicitly, any answer we give must be tentative. Many commentators have suggested that the materials have been pulled out of chronological order in order to put the prediction of the Babylonian exile at the end of the segment and thus to provide a transition from the Assyrian section of the book to the Babylonian one. That is probably correct, but I suggest a more complex reason for changing the order. Not only does it provide a chronological transition, but it also provides a theological one. Who is this promised Davidic Messiah? Is it not Hezekiah? He is the one whose faithfulness has secured continued life for the nation. He is the one who has manifested the kind of spirit that makes true leadership possible. We also know from Kings and Chronicles that he restored both justice and religious faithfulness in the land during his reign. Surely this is the child of chapter 9, the root from the stump of Jesse in chapter 11, the man on the throne in chapter 16, and the righteous, beautiful king in chapters 32\u201333.<\/p>     <p>\u2003Chapters 38\u201339 tell us this is not the case. However good a man Hezekiah may have been, he is just that, a man. Even if he receives extended life (ch. 38), death is still his fate, as the focus of the psalm in 38:9\u201320 emphasizes. He is not the one who can usher in an eternal kingdom. Nor is he the almighty God (9:6). His behavior, however commendable, is not infallible (39:1\u20138). Instead of using the opportunity to glorify the God who had delivered him from death, Hezekiah tries to impress the Babylonian envoys with his wealth and armaments. Trust is a way of life, not an affair of the moment. So these chapters not only prepare us for the coming Babylonian exile, they also prepare us for a further revelation of the nature and character of the promised Messiah. If it is not Hezekiah, then who is it? Chapters 40\u201366 address this question, and chapters 38\u201339 prepare the reader for it.<\/p>     ",
