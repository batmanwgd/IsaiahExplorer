This verse was quoted by the Savior when he cleansed the temple the second time (see <a class=\"ref\">Matt. 21:13; Mark 11:17; Luke 19:46<\/a>). That event was obviously not the fulfillment of Isaiah's prophecy, but Christ quoted the passage while expressing his wrath over the temple's being made \"a den of thieves.\" The prophecy points to the time when all people or nations would come up to worship and their sacrifices would be acceptable. This is undoubtedly<sub><\/sub>the same time period to which Isaiah referred in chapter 2 when he spoke of \"the mountain of the Lord's house\" and said that \"all nations shall flow unto it\" (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzY4OCI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 2:2-3<\/a>).<\/p>     ",
