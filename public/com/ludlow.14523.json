    "title": "Isaiah\u2019s Calling as a Deliberately Difficult Prophet",
    "html": "<p>This chapter diverges from Isaiah&rsquo;s usual canon of prophetic warnings to God&rsquo;s children, covering instead Isaiah&rsquo;s calling as a prophet of God. The beautiful imagery and powerful symbolism of Isaiah&rsquo;s vision help us to better understand the Lord&rsquo;s holiness and glory as well as our own imperfection in His presence. Isaiah&rsquo;s call echoes the foreordination of the Savior and His selfless submission to the Father&rsquo;s plan. Isaiah&rsquo;s charge from the Lord also foreshadows the challenges faced by the Master in His earthly ministry. Isaiah briefly alludes to the Savior&rsquo;s profound sacrifice, highlighting the house of Israel&rsquo;s initial rejection and then acceptance of their Master. Finally, Isaiah is promised that his words will eventually be understood as Israel is gathered in the latter days. As we review Isaiah&rsquo;s great vision, we connect to our own personal spiritual experiences and their significance in the context of our premortal desires and earthly missions.<\/p>",
