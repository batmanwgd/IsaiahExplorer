Such as these are self-excluded at once from the \u201crighteousness\u201d and the \u201csalvation\u201d of Jehovah, which ultimately imply, and coincide with each other. Their unfaithfulness, however, does not hinder the faithfulness of God. He brings near His salvation to all who are ready to receive it.
