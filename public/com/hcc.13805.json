    "html": "<p><i> Egypt.<\/i> Many refer this to the coming of Christ, (Calmet) at whose presence the idols fell down, and many saints adorned the country. (Worthington) &mdash; But the prophet may also literally refer to the wars of the Assyrians against Egypt. Sabacon having retired, after reigning fifty years, Anysis, and afterwards the priest of Sethon, succeeded to the throne. The latter was attacked by Sennacherib. After his death, twelve kingdoms were formed, but Psammitichus reunited them, and had Nechao for his successor. (Herodotus ii. 141, 158.) &mdash;<i> Behold.<\/i> The prophet speaks fourteen years before the attack of Sennacherib. &mdash;<i> Cloud.<\/i> Psalm xvii. 11. Some Fathers explain it of the blessed Virgin [Mary]. (Calmet) &mdash;<i> Moved.<\/i> Plundered by the Assyrians. (Menochius)<\/p> ",
