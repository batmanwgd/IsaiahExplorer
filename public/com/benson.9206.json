Heathen authors frequently speak of particular provinces and countries under the name of <i>orbis, orbis habitabilis, <\/i>and <i>orbis terrarum, the world, the habitable world, the whole world, <\/i>&c. And the same mode of speaking is often used in the Scriptures, where we not only find the Roman empire termed <i>the world, <\/i>(even <i>all the world,<\/i>) as <a class=\"ref\">Luke 2:1; Acts 11:28<\/a>; but also Babylon, (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3OTE4XQ==\">Isaiah 13:11<\/a>,) and this very land of Judea, <a class=\"ref\">John 12:19<\/a>; and <a class=\"ref\">John 18:20<\/a>. <i>The haughty people of the land <\/i>\u2014 Hebrew,  <span class=\"hebrew_text\">\u05de\u05e8\u05d5\u05dd \u05e2\u05dd<\/span>, <i>the height of the people, <\/i>those of the highest dignity in it; or <i>the lofty people, <\/i>as Bishop Lowth renders it. Not only common people are depressed and stink in sorrow, but the magistrates and rulers, the rich and powerful, the haughty and high-minded. Indeed, these are wont to suffer most under such calamities, either as having most to lose, or as not being used to hardships.<\/p>",
