    "html": " <p>The Harlot Babylon&rsquo;s &ldquo;skill&rdquo; or &ldquo;wisdom&rdquo; (<em>hokmatek <\/em>) and &ldquo;science&rdquo; or &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo; (<em>da&lsquo;attek <\/em>)&mdash;her sophisticated technology and human advancements&mdash;become &ldquo;wickedness&rdquo; or evil when used to promote her egocentric and self-serving agenda. So inured to her ways are people who grow up in her materialistic utopia that they fail to recognize its idolatrous nature. What characterizes the Harlot Babylon is that she and all who pertain to her are &ldquo;led astray,&rdquo; their preoccupation with the things of this world preventing them from discerning the fact that she embodies all that is destined to perish. <\/p> ",
