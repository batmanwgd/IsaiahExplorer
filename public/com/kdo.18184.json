    "html": "<p><em> \u201cFor thus saith Jehovah to the circumcised, Those who keep my Sabbaths, and decide for that in which I take pleasure, and take fast hold of my covenant; I give to them in my house and within my walls a memorial and a name better than sons and daughters: I give such a man an everlasting name, that shall not be cut off.\u201d<\/em> The second condition after the sanctification of the Sabbath has reference to the regulation of life according to the revealed will of God; the third to fidelity with regard to the covenant of circumcision. \u05d9\u05d3 also means a side, and hence a place (<a class=\"ref\">Deuteronomy 23:13<\/a>); but in the passage before us, where \u05d5\u05e9\u05c1\u05dd \u05d9\u05d3 form a closely connected pair of words, to which \u05d5\u05bc\u05de\u05d1\u05bc\u05e0\u05d5\u05ea \u05de\u05d1\u05bc\u05e0\u05d9 \u05dd is appended, it signifies the memorial, equivalent to \u05de\u05e6\u05bc\u05d1\u05ea (2 Sam 18; 1:1-24:25; <a class=\"ref\">1 Samuel 15:12<\/a>), as an index lifted up on high (<a class=\"ref\">Ezekiel 21:24<\/a>), which strikes the eye and arrests attention, pointing like a signpost to the person upon whom it is placed, like <em> monumentum a monendo <\/em> . They are assured that they will not be excluded from close fellowship with the church (\u201cin my house and within my walls\u201d), and also promised, as a superabundant compensation for the want of posterity, long life in the memory of future ages, by whom their long tried attachment to Jehovah and His people in circumstances of great temptation will not be forgotten.<\/p>",
