The initial <i>furnace of affliction<\/i> for Israel was her servitude in Egypt (<a class=\"ref\">Deut. 4:20; 1 Kgs. 8:51<\/a>). In all eras, the Saints are to be <i>refined<\/i> and made like Christ through affliction as metal is refined in the burning furnace. Though affliction is the furnace in which we will be refined, Christ is the refiner (<a class=\"ref\">Zech. 13:9; Mal. 3:2-3<\/a>), cleansing our hearts and souls so that we can enter the Father's kingdom (<a class=\"ref\">3 Ne. 27:19-20<\/a>). Those who are so refined are then chosen.<\/p> <p><i>chosen.<\/i> Israel (the covenant people) is given a mission and the authority to carry the gospel and its blessings to the world. In 48:12 the Lord refers to Israel as \"my called.\" The combination of the words <i>called<\/i> and <i>chosen<\/i> appears repeatedly in the scriptures (41:9; <a class=\"ref\">Matt. 22:14; 1 Pet. 2:9<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\">Rev. 17:14; D&amp;C 95:5<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\"> 121:34<\/a>). <\/p> <p>Elder Bruce R. McConkie asked, \"Called to what? Chosen for what?\" and then answered, \"Called in to the Church,&hellip;but chosen to be sealed up unto eternal life and to have one's calling and election made sure.\" <\/p> <p>Though Israel\u2014specifically, members of the Church\u2014has been rebellious, the Lord has pledged he would not cast her off. If she will be true to her calling, the Lord will choose her to receive the promised blessings.<\/p> ",
