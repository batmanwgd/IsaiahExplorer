    "html": "<p><em>The waters of Dimon -<\/em>Some have Dibon, others have Ribon and Rimon. St. Jerome observes that the same town was called both Dibon and Dimon. The reading is therefore indifferent.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Upon him that escapeth of Moab, etc. \"Upon the escaped of Moab, and Ariel, and the remnant of Admah\" -<\/em>The Septuagint for <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05e2\u05e8\u05d9\u05d4 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">aryeh<\/span>, read <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d0\u05e8\u05d9\u05d0\u05dc <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">ariel<\/span> . Ar Moab was called also Ariel or Areopolis, Hieron. and Theodoret. See Cellarius. They make <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d0\u05d3\u05de\u05d4 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">Admah<\/span>, also a proper name. Michaelis thinks that the Moabites might be called the remnant of Admah, as sprung from Lot and his daughters, escaped from the destruction of that and the other cities; or, metaphorically, as the Jews are called princes of Sodom, and people of Gomorrah,  <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTc2NjU=\">Isaiah 1:10<\/a>. Bibliotheque Orient. Part v., p. 195. The reading of this verse is very doubtful; and the sense, in every way in which it can be read, very obscure. - L. Calmet thinks there may be a reference to  <a class=\"ref\">1 Chronicles 11:22<\/a>, where it is said, \"Benaiah slew two lion-like men of Moab,\" or the two Ariels of Moab, and would therefore translate, \"I will bring down the remnant of Moab like Ariel, (which Benaiah smote), and them that are escaped like Adamah.\" They shall be exterminated, as were the inhabitants of those two cities. Ariel was a double city - the river Arnon dividing it in two. This is the two Ariels of Moab - not two lion-like men, much less two lions. See Calmet on this place.<\/p>",
