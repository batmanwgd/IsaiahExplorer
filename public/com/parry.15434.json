The Spirit of the Lord blows, in the form of judgments, upon men and causes them to wither away and die like grass (<a class=\"ref\">Ps. 102:11<\/a>). The glory of man is temporary, like that of the flower (<a class=\"ref\">James 1:10; 1 Pet. 1:24<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 124:7<\/a>). <\/p> ",
