The word &lsquo;earth&rsquo; here (\u05d0\u05e8\u05e5 &lsquo;a\u0304rets) is used evidently not to denote the whole world, but the land to which the prophet particularly refers&mdash;the land of Judea. It should have been translated the land (see <a class=\"ref\">Joel 1:2<\/a>). It is possible, however, that the word here may be intended to include so much of the nations that surrounded Palestine as were allied with it, or as were connected with it in the desolations under Nebuchadnezzar.<\/p><p><em>And turneth it upside down<\/em>&mdash;Margin, &lsquo;Perverteth the face thereof.&rsquo; That is, everything is thrown into confusion; the civil and religious institutions are disorganized, and derangement everywhere prevails.<\/p><p><em>And scattereth abroad... <\/em>&mdash;This was done in the invasion by the Chaldeans by the carrying away of the inhabitants into their long and painful captivity.<\/p> ",
