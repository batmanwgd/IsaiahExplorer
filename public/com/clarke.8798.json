Taken as two <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05de\u05d9 \u05db\u05d9 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">ki mey<\/span>, they signify for as the waters - when as one, <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05db\u05d9\u05de\u05d9 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">kimey<\/span>, they signify as the days. This latter reading is found in about four of Kennicott's and De Rossi's MSS. In one of my own it appears to have been intended as one word: but he who added the points, which are by a much later hand than the MS. itself, has pointed the letters so as to make the two words which are commonly found in the text. For the waters, Symmachus, Theodotion, the Syriac, Vulgate, and Arabic have days. The former seems to make the best sense; and the ancient Versions, except the Septuagint, support it.<\/p>",
