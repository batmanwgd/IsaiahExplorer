For with perfect faithfulness you have performed wonders, things planned of old&rdquo; ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTIwXQ==\">Isaiah 25:1<\/a>). Those who live by his law and word live to see his redemption that is founded on his atoning sacrifice for sin. Such acknowledge his merciful intervention: &ldquo;O Jehovah, you bring about our peace; even all that we have accomplished you have done for us&rdquo; ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTQzXQ==\">Isaiah 26:12<\/a>).<\/p> ",
