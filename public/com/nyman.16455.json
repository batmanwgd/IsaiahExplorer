Isaiah uses the word \"consumption.\" Paul was quoting <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODczXQ==\">Isaiah 10:22<\/a> in <a class=\"ref\">Rom. 9:27<\/a> and seemed to be continuing in verse 28 (compare <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODc0XQ==\">Isaiah 10:23<\/a> and 28:22; the rest of this prophecy concerning the remnant's return may also have been in the original Isaiah chapter 10). Both Paul and Isaiah were speaking within the context of a prophecy concerning latter-day restoration.<\/p>     ",
