    "html": "<p><b>(<a class=\"ref\">2 Nephi 27:32<\/a>).<\/b>\"<i>Make a man an offender for a word.<\/i>\" In one possible meaning, this phrase could apply to those who are offended because of their interpretation of another's words, even though no offense may have been intended. Another possibility is situations where one may make an offhand, perhaps even insensitive, remark that others turn into a great offense. The phrase could also apply to those who deliberately misconstrue or lie about another's words. All of these possibilities run counter to the repeatedcounsel in the scriptures to forgive, forget, and avoid faultfinding.<\/p>",
