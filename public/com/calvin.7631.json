As if he had said, \u201cThe Lord who speaks will actually shew how vast is the greatness of his power. Your fathers experienced it, and you will not experience it the less.\u201d Now, we are ungrateful to God, if former benefits do not lead us to entertain hope for the future; and especially when he intended to give a sure and striking proof of continual favor towards us. He brought the Jews out of Egypt on the express condition, that the deliverance which was accomplished should never be forgotten. (<a class=\"ref\">Exodus 13:9 <\/a>.) <\/p>,\n <p>The Prophet therefore represents God as actually present, and declares that he is the same God who surmounted every obstacle by his power, that he might be the Redeemer of his people. At that time he opened up a way through the sea, (<a class=\"ref\">Exodus 14:21 <\/a>,,) and afterwards <i>through the mighty waters, <\/i>,that is, through Jordan, which the Lord dried up, though it was running very rapidly. (<a class=\"ref\">Joshua 3:16 <\/a>.)
