    "html": " <p>Anciently God required animal sacrifice as a token of the coming of His Son, Jesus Christ, to atone for the sins of men. But the people took the form of worship that was to teach them faith in the coming of Christ and turned it into a mockery. They maintained the outer form of the ordinances but lost the spiritual meaning, for they showed no corresponding inward righteousness. Thus, the very forms of worship that were intended to save them became an abomination and worked to their condemnation. In strong language Isaiah revealed the Lord&rsquo;s feelings for their hypocritical religious observances. Those who killed the ox for sacrifice were viewed as though they offered a man, an act of great wickedness. Other sacrificial offerings would mean nothing more than sacrificing a dog or pig, both of which were considered abominable (see <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4OTI2XQ==\">v. 3<\/a>). People had &ldquo;chosen their own ways&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4OTI2XQ==\">v. 3<\/a>) instead of the Lord&rsquo;s. When called by God through His prophets, they refused to hearken. The result was &ldquo;delusions&rdquo; and &ldquo;fears&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4OTI3XQ==\">v. 4<\/a>), fit rewards for evildoers. <\/p> <p class=\"cite\"> LDS Church Educational System Old Testament Student Manual, 1 Kings&ndash;Malachi, Religion 302, Chapter 18, Item 28 <\/p> ",
