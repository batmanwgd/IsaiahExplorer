    "html": " <p> <i>And a covering in the day-time shall be a shadow from the heat. <\/i> Though the Prophet confirms what we have already noticed, that God will be our perpetual guide till he has brought us to the end of our journey, yet we are reminded that believers will always be exposed to numerous calamities. Scorching heat, and piercing cold, and still heavier distresses, press on them severely; when they escape from one danger, they meet with another. But the highest consolation is that against every inconvenience the <i>shadow <\/i> of the Lord will of itself be sufficient; for it will cover them in such a manner that nothing can injure or do them any harm. Although, therefore, various calamities and afflictions surround us on every side, still the Lord promises that he will assist us; as it is said in the Psalm, <\/p> \n <p>The sun shall not scorch thee by day, nor the moon by night; for the Lord will preserve thee from all evil. (<a class=\"ref\"><\/a>.) <\/p> \n <p>Nothing more is necessary than that we follow our calling, and perform our duty faithfully. It belongs equally to the condition of the good and of the bad that they suffer many inconveniencies; but bad men have no refuge, no place of concealment in which they may hide themselves, and they must be utterly overwhelmed. But blessed is the condition of the godly; for although they endure heat and cold, still they have a safe refuge in God. But that glory of which we formerly spoke must shine in us; otherwise we shall have no share in these things; and if we carry about with us God\u2019s mark, whenever we shall be assailed by a tempest, let us rest assured that he will be our protection. <\/p> ",
