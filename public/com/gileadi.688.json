    "html": " <p>As Jehovah comforts and endows his servant, so the servant comforts and endows those who mourn in Zion: &ldquo;At a favorable time I have answered you; in the day of salvation I have come to your aid: I have created you and appointed you to be a covenant of the people, to restore the Land and reapportion the desolate estates, to say to the captives, &lsquo;Come forth!&rsquo; and to those in darkness, &lsquo;Show yourselves!&rsquo;&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODY0NSI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 49:8-9<\/a>); &ldquo;&lsquo;Comfort and give solace to my people,&rsquo; says your God; &lsquo;speak kindly to Jerusalem. Announce to her that she has served her term, that her guilt has been expiated&rsquo;&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDIyXQ==\">Isaiah 40:1<\/a>). <\/p> <p>Mourners in Zion mourn not for themselves but (1) for the apostasy of Jehovah&rsquo;s people and its aftermath: &ldquo;Turn your attention from me, though I weep bitterly; hasten not to comfort me at the ruin of the Daughter of my People&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MDU3XQ==\">Isaiah 22:4<\/a>); (2) for Jehovah&rsquo;s servant and his ill-treatment by Jehovah&rsquo;s alienated people: &ldquo;I will heal him; I will guide him and amply console him and those who mourn for him&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4Nzg0XQ==\">Isaiah 57:18<\/a>); and (3) for Jehovah&rsquo;s wife who was anciently cast off: &ldquo;Rejoice with Jerusalem and be glad for her, all who love her; join in her celebration, all who mourn for her&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4OTMzXQ==\">Isaiah 66:10<\/a>). <\/p> <p>A disparity thus exists between Jehovah&rsquo;s elect, who constitute the Woman Zion, and Jehovah&rsquo;s people &ldquo;in Zion&rdquo; who comprise the apostates of his people. That disparity is resolved by taking into account the existence of two end-time groups of Jehovah&rsquo;s people: (1) the former wife who repents&mdash;the Woman Zion&mdash;whom Jehovah remarries (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODcyNV0seyIxODcyOSI6Mn1d\">Isaiah 54:1, 5-6<\/a>); and (2) the current adulterous wife whom he casts off (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NjY0XQ==\">Isaiah 50:1<\/a>), who becomes identified with the Harlot Babylon. Still, Jehovah&rsquo;s end-time servants who restore Jehovah&rsquo;s people of the first group themselves originate in the second group. <\/p> <p>Jehovah&rsquo;s servant anoints and clothes these servants in priestly garments as Moses anointed and clothed Aaron and his sons (cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODU0XQ==\">v 10<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\">Leviticus 8:1-13, Leviticus 8:1-13, 30<\/a>), empowering them to serve as Zion&rsquo;s proxy saviors. Called &ldquo;oaks of <em>righteousness <\/em> &rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODQ3XQ==\">v 3<\/a>; emphasis added), they typify the fruits of the servant&rsquo;s labors in preparing the way for Jehovah&rsquo;s coming as <em>salvation <\/em> (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzU1LDE4ODU2XQ==\">Isaiah 56:1; 62:1<\/a>). John, in his depiction of such a divine empowerment prior to Jehovah&rsquo;s Day of Judgment, speaks of an angel ascending from the east who ministers to 144,000 servants of God (<a class=\"ref\">Revelation 7:1-4<\/a>; cf. 14:1-5; <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4OTQyXQ==\">Isaiah 66:19<\/a>). <\/p> ",
