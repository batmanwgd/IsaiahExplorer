Some scholars suggest this applies specifically to the children of scattered and despised Judah, while others have identified the defeated Philistines as the subject of this promise they are also children of the Lord and He will not forget them. The identity of the redeemed poor does not matter. What is important is that their hungry bellies shall yet be filled with food and their starving spirits shall be fed with the bread of eternal truths.<\/p>",
