    "html": "<p><a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 5:2<\/a>.<i>And he fenced it <\/i>\u2014 In this verse the prophet, carrying on the allegory, proceeds to express, in parabolical language, the singular favours which God had bestowed on the Jewish nation, and the peculiar care which he had taken of them. He separated them from other nations, took them into covenant with himself, gave them a variety of laws and ordinances respecting his worship and service, and became, in an especial manner, their protector and governor. Thus <i>he fenced <\/i>his vineyard; Hebrew,  <span class=\"hebrew_text\">\u05d9\u05e2\u05d6\u05e7\u05d4\u05d5<\/span>, <i>circumsepsit eam, hedged it round <\/i>on all sides. In removing the heathen nations, and destroying all the forms of their idolatrous worship, forbidding all idolatry, and all intimate friendship and intermarriages with idolaters, and by giving them plain and ample directions for their whole conduct, lest they should fall by error or mistake, he <i>gathered out the stones thereof <\/i>\u2014 Which otherwise might have marred the land, (<a class=\"ref\">2 Kings 3:19<\/a>,) and injured the vines. In other words, he removed all the hinderances of fruitfulness. In that he formed his church of the posterity of those wise, holy, and faithful men, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and purged and reformed the nation in the wilderness before he established them in Canaan, he might truly be said to <i>plant <\/i>his vineyard <i>with the choicest vine<\/i> \u2014 Or, as the Hebrew is, <i>the vine of Sorek, <\/i>alluding to a valley between Ascalon and Gaza, running up eastward into the tribe of Judah, and famous for the best vines, and the richest vineyards. <i>And he built a tower in the midst of it <\/i>\u2014 As edifices, termed towers by the Jews, were erected in vineyards, containing, as Bishop Lowth supposes, \u201call the offices and implements, and the whole apparatus necessary for the culture of them, and the making of wine;\u201d and, doubtless, also serving for the accommodation and defence of the labourers; and as places of pleasure for the owners of the vineyards; so God provided his church with a most commodious and magnificent temple, furnished with all conveniences for every part of that worship and service which he required his people to perform to him, and affording every requisite accommodation for the residence, support, and comfort of the priests and Levites, while ministering in holy things, and employed in cultivating God\u2019s mystical vineyard; and where he, the Lord of the vineyard, might be peculiarly present, as the protector and consolation of his people, their refuge and strength, and very present help in times of trouble or danger. Thus the Chaldee paraphrast: \u201cI have constituted them the plant of a choice vine, and built my sanctuary in the midst of them.\u201d So also Jerome interprets the clause. He <i>also made a wine-press therein <\/i>\u2014 Hebrew,  <span class=\"hebrew_text\">\u05d5\u05d2\u05dd \u05d9\u05e7\u05d1 \u05d7\u05e6\u05d1<\/span>, which Bishop Lowth properly translates, \u201cAnd he hewed out also a lake therein;\u201d observing that the word  <span class=\"hebrew_text\">\u05d9\u05e7\u05d1<\/span>means, not the wine-press itself, or <i>calcatorium, <\/i>(the vessel or place where the grapes were stamped, or trod for the wine, which is expressed by another word,) but \u201cwhat the Romans called <i>lacus, <\/i>the <i>lake; <\/i>the large open place or vessel, which, by a conduit, or spout, received the <i>must <\/i>(or new wine) from the wine-press.\u201d This place, he thinks, in very hot countries, it was necessary, or very convenient, to have under ground, or in a cave hewed out of the side of a rock, \u201cfor coolness; that the heat might not cause too great a fermentation, and sour the must.\u201d Now this lake, made to contain the new wine, may here signify the great altar, made to receive the sacrifices and oblations, as the fruits of the spiritual vineyard. <i>And he looked that it should bring forth grapes <\/i>\u2014 Real, genuine fruit, true, substantial piety and virtue, or godliness and righteousness; <i>and it brought forth wild grapes <\/i>\u2014 Or, rather, <i>poisonous berries, <\/i>as Bishop Lowth translates  <span class=\"hebrew_text\">\u05d1\u05d0\u05e9\u05c1\u05d9\u05dd<\/span>, the word here used, which does not signify \u201cmerely useless, unprofitable grapes, such as wild grapes; but grapes offensive to the smell, noxious, poisonous;\u201d such as those mentioned <a class=\"ref\">2 Kings 4:39-41<\/a>. For, according to the force and intent of the allegory, \u201cTo good grapes ought to be opposed fruit of a dangerous and pernicious quality; as, in the explication of it, to judgment is opposed tyranny, and to righteousness oppression.\u201d See an elegant paraphrase of this part of the parable, <a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 2:21<\/a>.<\/p>",
