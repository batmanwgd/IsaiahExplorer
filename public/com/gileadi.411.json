    "html": "<p>By presuming to speak on behalf of Jehovah, the God of Israel, and by claiming his authority, Rabshakeh indeed &ldquo;scorns the living God&rdquo; ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MzU3XQ==\">Isaiah 37:4<\/a>): &ldquo;Whom have you mocked and ridiculed? Against who have you raised your voice, lifting your eyes to high heaven? Against the Holy One of Israel!&rdquo; ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4Mzc2XQ==\">Isaiah 37:23<\/a>). While it is true that Assyria&rsquo;s invasion of Judea is a consequence of his people&rsquo;s transgressions, Jehovah is nevertheless able to bring good out of evil by delivering those who trust in him. Through such means he manifests his power in the eyes of his people and of his people&rsquo;s enemies alike.<\/p> ",
