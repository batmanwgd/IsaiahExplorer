    "html": " <p>Israel deserves destruction, yet because she has a few righteous people, the Lord will \"not destroy them all\" (65:8). This response is a direct answer to Isaiah's plea in 63:17. The Lord will provide an inheritance for his elect (65:9), and a safe place for the righteous (65:10). Yet the Lord will send judgments upon the wicked, who chose their own way rather than the things the Lord delighted in (65:12). Because of Israel's wickedness, the Lord threatens to slay her people and make his covenant with another people (65:15).<\/p> <p>The Lord contrasts the blessings of the righteous (\"my servants\") with the punishments of the wicked: the righteous will eat while the wicked go hungry; the righteous will drink while the wicked thirst; the righteous will rejoice while the wicked will be ashamed; the righteous will sing in joy while the wicked will cry in sorrow (65:13-14). These blessings and cursings have both temporal and spiritual applications: for example, the wicked will go hungry for the bread of life and thirsty for the living waters brought by Christ.<\/p> <blockquote> Thus saith the Lord, As the <i>new wine<\/i> is found in the cluster, and one saith, <u>Destroy it not<\/u>; for a blessing is in <i>it<\/i>:     <br>so will I do for my servants' sakes, that <u>I may not destroy<\/u> them all. (65:8)     <br>And I will bring forth a <i>seed<\/i> <u>out of Jacob <\/u>,     <br>and <u>out of Judah<\/u> an <i>inheritor<\/i> of my mountains:     <br>and <i>mine elect<\/i> <u>shall inherit it<\/u>,     <br>and <i>my servants<\/i> <u>shall dwell there<\/u>. (65:9)     <br>And <i>Sharon<\/i> shall be a <u>fold of flocks<\/u>,     <br>and the <i>valley of Achor<\/i> a <u>place for the herds<\/u> to lie down in, for my people that have sought me. (65:10)     <br>But ye are they that <i>forsake<\/i> the <u>Lord<\/u>,     <br>that <i>forget<\/i> <u>my holy mountain<\/u>,     <br>that <i>prepare a table<\/i> for <u>that troop<\/u>,     <br>and that <i>furnish the drink offering<\/i> unto <u>that number<\/u>. (65:11)     <br>Therefore will <i>I number you<\/i> <u>to the sword<\/u>,     <br>and <i>ye shall all bow down<\/i> <u>to the slaughter<\/u>:     <br>because <i>when I called,<\/i> <u>ye did not answer<\/u>;     <br><i>when I spake,<\/i> <u>ye did not hear<\/u>;     <br>but <i>did evil<\/i> before <u>mine eyes<\/u>,     <br>and <i>did choose that<\/i> wherein <u>I <\/u> <i>delighted not.<\/i> (65:12)     <br>Therefore thus saith the Lord God, Behold, <i>my servants shall eat,<\/i> but <u>ye shall be hungry<\/u>: behold, <i>my servants shall drink,<\/i> but <u>ye shall be thirsty<\/u>:     <br>behold, <i>my servants<\/i> <u>shall rejoice<\/u>,     <br>but <i>ye<\/i> <u>shall be ashamed<\/u>: (65:13)     <br>Behold, <i>my servants<\/i> shall <u>sing for joy of heart<\/u>,     <br>but <i>ye<\/i> shall <u>cry for sorrow of heart<\/u>, and shall <u>howl for vexation of spirit<\/u>. (65:14)     <br>And <i>ye<\/i> shall leave <u>your name<\/u> for a curse unto my chosen: for the Lord God shall slay thee, and call <i>his servants<\/i> by <u>another name<\/u>: (65:15)     <br>That he who <i>blesseth himself in the earth<\/i> shall bless himself in the <u>God of truth<\/u>;     <br>and he that <i>sweareth in the earth<\/i> shall swear by the <u>God of truth<\/u>;     <br>because the <i>former troubles<\/i> <u>are forgotten<\/u>,     <br>and because <i>they<\/i> <u>are hid from mine eyes<\/u>.
