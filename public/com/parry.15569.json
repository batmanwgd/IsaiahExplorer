Indeed, the Atonement has already been firmly decreed, and mankind's sins can be blotted out by the Redeemer (44:22). Because of this great gift of redemption, all of God's creations sing praises to him (44:23).<\/p> <blockquote>Remember these, O Jacob and Israel; for thou art my servant:     <br>I have formed thee; thou art my servant:     <br>O Israel, thou shalt not be forgotten of me. (44:21)     <br>I have blotted out, as a <i>thick cloud,<\/i> thy <u>transgressions<\/u>,     <br>and, as a <i>cloud,<\/i> thy <u>sins<\/u>: return unto me; for I have redeemed thee. (44:22)     <br><i>Sing,<\/i> O ye <u>heavens<\/u>; for the Lord hath done it:     <br><i>shout,<\/i> ye <u>lower parts of the earth<\/u>:     <br><i>break forth into singing,<\/i> ye <u>mountains<\/u>, O <u>forest<\/u>, and <u>every tree<\/u> therein:     <br>for the <i>Lord hath redeemed<\/i> <u> Jacob <\/u>,     <br>and <i>glorified himself<\/i> in <u>Israel<\/u>.
