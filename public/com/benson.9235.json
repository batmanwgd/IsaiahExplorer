This seems to be spoken of the siege which the Jewish people endured, and of all their other labours and sufferings to prevent their coming under the Chaldean yoke. Thus the attempt of Zedekiah to withstand Nebuchadnezzar we find only brought greater evils upon the country, <a class=\"ref\">2 Chronicles 36:13 <\/a>. We <i>have not wrought any deliverance in the earth <\/i>\u2014In our land, where we had far greater advantages than we could have had elsewhere. <i>Neither have the inhabitants of the world <\/i>\u2014The Assyrians, Chaldeans, or our other enemies; <i>fallen <\/i>\u2014By our means. <\/p> ",
