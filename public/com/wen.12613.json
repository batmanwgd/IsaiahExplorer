In truth\u2014That is, firmly and constantly; for truth is often put for the stability and certainty of a thing, as <a class=\"ref\">2 Chronicles 32:1 ; Proverbs 11:18<\/a>. Tabernacle\u2014ln the house, or palace, which is called a tent, or tabernacle, with respect to the unsettledness of David's house, which now indeed was more like a tabernacle than a strong palace. Seeking\u2014Searching out the truth of things with care and diligence. Hasting\u2014Neither denying, nor yet delaying justice.",
