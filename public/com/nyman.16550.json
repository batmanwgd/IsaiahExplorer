As the Jews used phylacteries to remind them continually of the commandments of God, they wrote the commandments and wore them where they were continually before their eyes (see <a class=\"ref\">Deut. 6:6-9<\/a>). The Lord declared that he was keeping the promises made to Zion continually before his eyes, and that he would fulfill them at the time and in the manner promised. Another deeper meaning would be that the covenant made by Christ (to atone for the sins of the world and to bring to pass the resurrection) would be sealed or completed by his being nailed to the cross. These nail prints in the palms of his hands would then be a sign to the world, and especially to the Jews, that he had kept his promise (see <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODA3NiwxODA3OCwyMzA1NiwyMzA2Nl0seyIzODcwMCI6Nn1d\">Isaiah 22:23, 25; Zech. 12:10; 13:6; D&amp;C 45:48-53<\/a>).<\/p>     ",
