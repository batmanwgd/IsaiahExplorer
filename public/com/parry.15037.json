The phrase <i>Babylon is fallen<\/i> is an expression that was also revealed to John (Rev. 14:8; 18:2) and Joseph Smith (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 1:16<\/a>). <\/p> <p><i>graven images of her gods he hath broken.<\/i> Conquerors often made their captives' humiliation complete and their new kingdom secure by destroying the deities of the conquered people. They did this to show that <i>their<\/i> deities and kingdom were greater and more powerful than those of the fallen empire. When Jehovah destroys the kingdoms of the world (Babylon) at his second coming and before his millennial reign, he will destroy the people's images and gods.<\/p> ",
