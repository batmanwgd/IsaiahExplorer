The first is <em>Meaning<\/em> their captivity in Babylon. If they are to be the redeemed servants of the Lord, they need to be set free and to live and minister in the land of God\u2019s promises. That issue was dealt with in chapters 41\u201348: God has a plan of deliverance for his people, even before the tragedy has occurred, and there is nothing the Babylonian gods or the Babylonian power can do to stop that plan from being accomplished.<\/p>     <p>\u2003But there is a second problem confronting both God and his people. What is to be done about the sin that got the people into this dilemma in the first place? God has declared repeatedly that they are his chosen servants. But how can this be? How can these sinful people ever serve a just and holy God? He cannot simply ignore their sin, so what is to be done? In its own way, this alienation from God is a much more serious problem than their captivity in Babylon. So what can God\u2019s grace do to address this problem?<\/p>     <p>\u2003The answer to that question is given in chapters 49\u201355. Although the language and imagery of captivity continues, specific reference to Babylon and its idols is conspicuously absent, as is any further reference to Cyrus. In other words, a different kind of captivity is being addressed here, and the deliverer from this captivity is the Servant of the Lord, who was first introduced in 42:1\u20139. He will be for Israel what Israel could not be in itself. His servanthood will make possible theirs\u2014and ours. As he becomes the means of Israel\u2019s restoration to God, he makes them the prototype for the restoration of all the world.<\/p>     <p>\u2003This subdivision has three sections. In 49:1\u201352:12 God repeatedly insists that he has not cast his people off. In other words, the hope of the world begins in the heart of the Creator, who is unwilling to let his people go. But the section is also marked by an increasing intensity of anticipation. Somehow God is going to deliver his people from their captivity to sin. This intensity reaches its climax in chapter 52, with its ringing call to leave the captivity that has held them. The third section (54:1\u201355:13) is marked by an invitation to participate in a deliverance that is seen as accomplished.<\/p>     <p>\u2003What accounts for the change from anticipation to participation? It is the second section (52:13\u201353:12), the fourth and last of the so-called \u201cSuffering Servant\u201d passages, which provides the answer to our question, as the preceding \u201cServant Songs\u201d (49:1\u201313; 50:4\u20139) have led us to expect. The Servant of the Lord will give his life so that God\u2019s people may be restored from their alienation into his fellowship and his service.<\/p>     ",
