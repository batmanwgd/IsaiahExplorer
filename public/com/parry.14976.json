The olives (KJV reads \"grapes\") that the gleaners could not reach with their hands were knocked from the upper branches with a stick, or they were shaken from the tree (24:13; <a class=\"ref\">Deut. 24:20<\/a>). Isaiah continues the comparison between the valley of Rephaim's harvest and Israel's destruction by likening her few remaining inhabitants to the four or five olives that remain in the tree's uppermost bough (<a class=\"ref\">2 Kgs. 24:14; 25:12<\/a>). <\/p> ",
