    "html": "<p>Chapter 54 depicts many features of the new covenant Jehovah makes with his people at the inception of the millennial age, the term &ldquo;charity&rdquo; denoting its unconditional nature. As Jehovah made a &ldquo;covenant of peace&rdquo; with the Levites and with King David (<a class=\"ref\">Numbers 25:10-13; Jeremiah 33:20-22; Malachi 2:4-6<\/a>), so he makes it in the days of his end-time servant named David (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODc0NCI6M30=\">Isaiah 55:3-5<\/a> ;<a class=\"ref\">Ezekiel 34:23-25; 37:24-26<\/a>). His servant&rsquo;s personifying Jehovah&rsquo;s<em>covenant<\/em> , moreover (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDg3LDE4NjQ1XQ==\">Isaiah 42:6; 49:8<\/a>), means that he serves as its mediator as Moses did anciently (<a class=\"ref\">Exodus 19:3-6; Deuteronomy 29:1<\/a>).<\/p><p>The new covenant further resembles the covenant Jehovah made with Noah after the Flood (<a class=\"ref\">Genesis 9:8-17<\/a>). Only this time a world cataclysm like the Flood involves the shaking of mountains or nations. He who &ldquo;shakes&rdquo; the nations is the king of Assyria\/Babylon, who personifies Jehovah&rsquo;s<em>anger<\/em> (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODU2LDE3OTQ1XQ==\">Isaiah 10:5; 14:16<\/a>). The peace that characterizes the millennial age&mdash;as manifested in Jehovah&rsquo;s &ldquo;covenant of peace&rdquo;&mdash;stems directly from the &ldquo;price of our peace&rdquo; Jehovah pays in his descent phase (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTQzLDE4NTY5LDE4NzE3XQ==\">Isaiah 26:12; 45:7; 53:5<\/a>). That peace, his people now enjoy everlastingly (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTM0LDE4MzAwLDE4NzA0XQ==\">Isaiah 26:3; 33:20; 52:7<\/a>).<\/p> ",
