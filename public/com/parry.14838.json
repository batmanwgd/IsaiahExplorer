They are also symbolic of the worldly powers that will fight against Zion in the last days. Isaiah tells those who dwell in Zion to trust God and <i>be not afraid of the Assyrian,<\/i> for his power will be temporary and limited. Eventually God will destroy the Assyrian and save the remnant of Israel.<\/p> <p><i>rod\/staff.<\/i> Assyria will smite Israel with a rod, similar to the manner in which Egypt of old forced the children of Israel to become slaves (\"after the manner of Egypt\"; <a class=\"ref\">Ex. 1:11,  14<\/a>). The term <i>staff<\/i> may also be rendered scepter, representing dominion; thus Assyria will smite the Israelites with the rod and then rule over them.<\/p> ",
