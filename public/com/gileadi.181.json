While the righteous experience joy at their miraculous deliverance, the wicked yield to terror as they experience the world&rsquo;s all-time worst-case scenario. In that day, all the earth&rsquo;s inhabitants go into labor, some to perish, others to be delivered (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgwMzciOjN9LHsiMTgxNDgiOjJ9LHsiMTg5MzAiOjV9XQ==\">Isaiah 21:1-3; 26:17-18; 66:7-11<\/a>). Those who exercise perfect integrity live through the devouring fire to see Jehovah&rsquo;s coming in glory (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3sic2luZ2xlcyI6WzE4NTA4XX0seyIxODI5NCI6M31d\">Isaiah 33:14-16; 43:2<\/a>). Others, like Lot&rsquo;s wife, disintegrate in its conflagration (cf. <a class=\"ref\">Genesis 19:24-26<\/a>).<\/p>",
