    "html": " <i>he shall pass over to his<\/i><b> <\/b><i>strong hold for fear. <\/i>The Assyrians (the wicked) will flee to their own fortresses because of their fear of the Lord and his power to destroy.<\/p> <p><i>princes shall be afraid of the ensign. <\/i>Even the mighty leaders of Assyria, or the world, will flee before the ensign, or Zion's banner. This ensign identifies the Lord's army, the inhabitants of Zion. A modern revelation confirms that \"the glory of the Lord\" shall be in Zion, and \"the terror of the Lord also shall be there, insomuch that the wicked will not come unto it&hellip;. And it shall be said among the wicked: Let us not go up to battle against Zion, for the inhabitants of Zion are terrible; wherefore we cannot stand\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 45:67-70<\/a>). <\/p> <p><i>whose<\/i> <i>fire is in Zion, and his furnace in Jerusalem. <\/i>Zion and Jerusalem are the centers of the Lord's reign during the Millennium (24:23). The phrases<i> fire is in Zion<\/i> and <i>furnace in Jerusalem <\/i>find a counterpart in 33:14, where it is written that the righteous will <i>dwell with the devouring fire<\/i> and <i>everlasting burnings, <\/i>which are references to Christ. The two phrases in this verse also seem to parallel <a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 45:66-67<\/a>, which speaks of the \"glory of the Lord\" and the \"terror of the Lord\" that will be in Zion, protecting the righteous from the wicked.<\/p> ",
