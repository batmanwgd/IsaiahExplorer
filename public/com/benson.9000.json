The church and commonwealth of Israel is often called God\u2019s vineyard, and here<i>the vineyard,<\/i> by way of eminence, intrusted to the care of these rulers. <i>The spoil of the poor is in your houses<\/i>\u2014The goods which you have violently taken away from them. <i>What mean ye that ye beat my people? \u2014<\/i> What warrant have ye for it? How durst you presume to do it?<i>and grind the faces of the poor \u2014<\/i> A strong metaphor to denote grievous oppression; but it is exceeded by the Prophet <a class=\"ref\">Micah 3:1-3<\/a>.<\/p> ",
