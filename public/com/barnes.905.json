A child would usually learn to address his parents in that time. In fact, the event here predicted occurred in less than three years from the time when the prophecy was spoken; see the notes at <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 7:16<\/a>.<\/p><p><em>Before the king of Assyria<\/em>&mdash;By the king, or by his conquests. By the spoil of Samaria here, is to be understood, not the plunder which should be carried away from the city, but from the kingdom of Samaria. In other places, the land is called by the name of the capital; compare <a class=\"ref\">2 Kings 17:26; 2 Kings 23:19; Jeremiah 31:5<\/a>. The city of Samaria was not plundered until eighteen years after the time mentioned here by the prophet; <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 8:5-6<\/a>. These verses introduce again what was predicted in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 7:17<\/a>, following, respecting the invasion of the land by the king of Assyria. The cause of the invasion is specified, and the consequences are foretold.<\/p>",
