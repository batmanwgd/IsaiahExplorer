Her influence for good will be felt even in places considered to be spiritually or physically \"desolate.\" As she gathers in strength, additional stakes will be established and the tent of Zion will further expand.<\/p>     <p>The plea of the Lord to His covenant people of the latter days is: \"For Zion must increase in beauty, and in holiness; her borders must be enlarged; her stakes must be strengthened; yea, verily I say unto you, Zion must arise and put on her beautiful garments.\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 82:14<\/a>.)<\/p>     <p>Isaiah recited a similar plea in verse 1 of chapter 52: \"Awake, awake; put on thy strength, O Zion; put on thy beautiful garments.\" In response to the question of what Isaiah meant when he said \"Put on thy strength, O Zion and what people had Isaiah reference to?\" the Prophet Joseph Smith declared: \"He had reference to those whom God should call in the last days, who should hold the power of priesthood to bring again Zion, and the redemption of Israel; and to put on her strength is to put on the authority of the priesthood, which she, Zion, has a right to by lineage; also to return to that power which she had lost.\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 113:7-8<\/a>.)<\/p>",
