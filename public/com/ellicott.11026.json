The conqueror shall plunder the cities of Israel as the reaper cuts off the ears of corn. With his usual Dantesque vividness the prophet localises the imagery. The valley of Rephaim, or, as in<a class=\"ref\">Joshua 15:8; Joshua 18:16<\/a> , \u201cof the giants,\u201d lay to the south-west of Jerusalem in the direction of Bethlehem. It was famous for its fertility, and was often on that account attacked by the Philistines, who came to carry off its crops (<a class=\"ref\">2 Samuel 23:13<\/a>). The prophet had looked on the reaper\u2019s work and had seen in it a parable of that of the Assyrian invader.<\/p> ",
