    "html": " <i>noise of the multitude&hellip;nations gathered together.<\/i> The word <i>noise<\/i> in this verse may also be translated \"voice,\" such as in \"the voice of many people in the mountains.\" Elsewhere Isaiah likens the noise of a great multitude of people to the \"noise of the seas\" (17:12) and \"the rushing of mighty waters\" (17:12). The saints, or <i>multitude,<\/i> will gather together from the world's nations and kingdoms with the intent of building Zion (<a class=\"ref\">Matt. 24:30-31; D&amp;C 29:7-11<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\"> 45:66; 103:22<\/a>). <\/p> <p> <i>in the mountains like as of a great people.<\/i> This has reference to gathering of the Saints in the Rocky Mountains. On 6 August 1842, Joseph Smith prophesied that some of the Saints would \"live to go and assist in making settlements and build cities and see the saints become <i>a mighty people in the midst of the Rocky Mountains.<\/i>\" <\/p> <p><i>Lord of Hosts mustereth the hosts of the battle.<\/i> See commentary on 1:9.<\/p> ",
