    "html": "          <p>The Savior was to be a light to the Gentiles, as foretold here by Isaiah and pronounced by Simeon, the devout temple worker, in a blessing given to the infant Jesus (see <a class=\"ref\">Luke 2:32<\/a>). However, this light was also to be held up by others. Christ told the Nephites that he was the light to be held up by them (see <a class=\"ref\">3 Ne. 18:24<\/a>). And he may have been quoting part of verse 7 in sending Paul to the Gentiles to hold up that light (see <a class=\"ref\">Acts 26:17-18<\/a>). These verses in Isaiah speak of those servants who were to be called, following Christ's personal ministry, to further the mission which he would begin. The passage also speaks of another aspect of his mission-his preaching to the spirits in prison. Peter bore witness that Christ visited the spirits in prison during the interim between his death and resurrection (see <a class=\"ref\">1 Pet. 3:18-19<\/a>). After quoting <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDg4XQ==\">Isaiah 42:7<\/a>, Joseph Smith commented, \"It is very evident from this that He not only went to preach to them, but to deliver, or bring them out of the prison house\" (TPJS, p. 219). This work of liberating the captive spirits in the spirit world, which was begun by Christ, is now being furthered by the latter-day servants, restored Israel, as they perform ordinances vicariously for those who have died and entered into the spirit world. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODQ4NiI6NX0=\">Isaiah 42:5-9<\/a> has been cited by modern Church leaders as evidence of restored Israel's responsibility to help save the dead (see Joseph Fielding Smith, DS, 2:155; Theodore M. Burton, CR, Oct. 1964, p. 33). Such is the work of the Lord extended to the latter days before his judgments come upon the earth.<\/p>     ",
