When the ordinances such as baptism (JST <a class=\"ref\">Gen. 17:3-6; Moro. 8:14<\/a>, <a class=\"ref\"> 16<\/a>) are changed, their power to save is lost.<\/p> <p> <i>broken the everlasting covenant.<\/i> The everlasting covenant is the gospel with its covenants and ordinances. Because the ordinances had been perverted or lost, the Lord revealed for the last time through the Prophet Joseph Smith the everlasting covenant for the earth, \"lest all of the earth be smitten with a curse\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 1:12-16,  22<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 29:8-10<\/a>). <\/p> ",
