    "html": " <p> <em>Languish \"Are put to shame\"\u2014<\/em>, Here the text of Jeremiah leaves us much at a loss, in a place that seems to be greatly corrupted. The Septuagint join the two last words of this verse with the beginning of the following. Their rendering is: <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bf\u03c5\u03ba \u03b5\u03bd\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03c0\u03b7\u03c3\u03b7\u0345, \u03c4\u03b1 \u03c0\u03b5\u03b4\u03b9\u03b1 \u0395\u03c3\u03b5\u03b2\u03c9\u03bd<\/span>,. For <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d0\u05da <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, ach<\/span>, they must have read <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d0\u05dc <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, al<\/span>,; otherwise, how came they by the negative, which seems not to belong to this place? Neither is it easy to make sense of the rest without a small alteration, by reading, instead of <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u03b5\u03bd\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03c0\u03b7\u03c3\u03b7\u0345 \u03c4\u03b1, \u03b5\u03bd\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03c0\u03b7\u03c3\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9<\/span>,. In a word, the Arabic version taken from the Septuagint, plainly authorizes this reading of the Septuagint, and without the negative; and it is fully confirmed by MSS. Pachom. and 1. D. II., which have both of them <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u03b5\u03bd\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03c0\u03b7\u03c3\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c0\u03b5\u03b4\u03b9\u03b1 \u0395\u03c3\u03b5\u03b2\u03c9\u03bd<\/span>, without the negative; which makes an excellent sense, and, I think, gives us the true reading of the Hebrew text; <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d7\u05e9\u05d1\u05d5\u05df \u05e9\u05d3\u05de\u05d5\u05ea \u05e0\u05db\u05dc\u05de\u05d5 \u05d0\u05da <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, ak nichlemu shadmoth cheshbon<\/span>,. They frequently render the verb <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05e0\u05db\u05dc\u05dd <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, nichlam<\/span>, by <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u03b5\u03bd\u03c4\u03c1\u03b5\u03c0\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9<\/span>,. And <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05e0\u05db\u05dc\u05de\u05d5 <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, nichlemu<\/span>, answers perfectly well to <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d0\u05de\u05dc\u05dc <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, umlal<\/span>, the parallel word in the next line. The MSS. vary in expressing the word <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05e0\u05db\u05d0\u05d9\u05dd <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, nechaim<\/span>, which gives no tolerable sense in this place; one reads <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05e0\u05d5\u05db\u05d0\u05d9\u05dd <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, nochaim<\/span>,; two others <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d1\u05db\u05d0\u05d9\u05dd <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, bechaim<\/span>,; in another the <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05db <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, caph<\/span>, is upon a rasure of two letters; and the Vulgate instead of it reads <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05de\u05db\u05d5\u05ea\u05dd <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, mecotham<\/span>, <i>plagas suas<\/i>,. - L. <\/p>\n\n <p>For the men of Kirhares ye shall make a moan. For the fields of Heshbon are put to shame. This is Bp. Lowth's sense of the passage. <\/p>\n\n <p> <em>Her branches are stretched out \"Her branches extended themselves\"\u2014<\/em>, For <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05e0\u05d8\u05e9\u05d5 <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, nitteshu<\/span>, a MS. has <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05e0\u05d2\u05e9\u05d5 <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, niggeshu<\/span>,; which may perhaps be right. Compare <a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 48:32<\/a>, which has in this part of the sentence the synonymous word <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05e0\u05d2\u05e2\u05d5 <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, nagau<\/span>,. <\/p>\n\n <p>The meaning of this verse is, that the wines of Sibmah and Heshbon were greatly celebrated, and in high repute with all the great men and princes of that and the neighboring countries; who indulged themselves even to intemperance in the use of them. So that their vines were so much in request as not only to be propagated all over the country of Moab to the sea of Sodom, but to have scions of them sent even beyond the sea into foreign countries. <\/p>\n\n <p> <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d4\u05dc\u05de\u05d5 <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, halemu<\/span>, knocked down, demolished; that is overpowered, intoxicated. The drunkards of Ephraim are called by the prophet, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTY2XQ==\">Isaiah 28:1<\/a>, <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d9\u05d9\u05df \u05d4\u05dc\u05d5\u05de\u05d9 <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, halumey yayin<\/span>, drinkers of wine. See Schultens on <a class=\"ref\">Proverbs 23:25<\/a>. Gratius, speaking of the Mareotic wine, says of it, <\/p>\n\n <p> <i>Pharios quae fregit noxia reges<\/i>,. Cyneg. 312. <\/p>",
