The idea of prostitution as representing apostasy from Jehovah was involved in the thought that Israel was the bride whom He had wooed and won (Hosea 1-3; <a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 2:2<\/a>). The imagery was made more impressive by the fact that actual prostitution entered so largely into the ritual of many of the forms of idolatry to which the Israelites were tempted (<a class=\"ref\">Numbers 25:1-2<\/a>). So Ezekiel (<a class=\"ref\">Ezekiel 16:1-14<\/a>) develops the symbolism with an almost terrible fulness. So our Lord spoke of the Pharisees as an \u201cadulterous generation\u201d (<a class=\"ref\">Matthew 12:39<\/a>). The fact that Hosea, an earlier contemporary, had been led to tell how he had been taught the truth thus set forth by a living personal experience, is not without significance in its bearing on the genesis of Isaiah\u2019s thoughts.<\/p>\n <p>Righteousness lodged in it; but now murderers.\u2014Better, assassins. The word implies not casual homicide, but something like the choice of murder and robbery as a profession. Hosea (<a class=\"ref\">Hosea 6:9<\/a>) had painted a like picture as true of Samaria. The traveller who sojourned in Jerusalem, the poor who lived there, were exposed to outrage and murder; and all this was passing before men\u2019s eyes at the very time when they were boasting, as it were, of their \u201cglorious reformation.\u201d<\/p>",
