    "html": "<p> Their whole nature is broken up into discord. <em> \u201cThe way of peace they know not, and there is no right in their roads: they make their paths crooked: every one who treads upon them knows no peace.\u201d<\/em> With \u05d3\u05bc\u05e8 \u05da , the way upon which a man goes, the prophet uses interchangeably (here and in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODA4XQ==\">Isaiah 59:7<\/a>) \u05de\u05e1\u05dc\u05bc\u05d4 , a high-road thrown up with an embankment; \u05de\u05e2\u05d2\u05bc\u05dc (with the plural in <em> \u0131\u0302m <\/em> and <em> o\u0302th <\/em> ), a carriage-road; and \u05e0\u05ea\u05d9\u05d1\u05d4 , a footpath formed by the constant passing to and fro of travellers. Peaceable conduct, springing form a love of peace, and aiming at producing peace, is altogether strange to them; no such thing is to be met with in their path as the recognition of practice of right: they make their paths for themselves ( \u05dc\u05d4\u05dd , <em> dat. ethicus<\/em> ) , i.e., most diligently, twisting about; and whoever treads upon them (<em> ba\u0302h <\/em> , neuter, as in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTU2XQ==\">Isaiah 27:4<\/a>), forfeits all enjoyment of either inward or outward peace. <em> Sha\u0302lo\u0304m <\/em> is repeated significantly, in Isaiah's peculiar style, at the end of the verse. The first strophe of the prophecy closes here: it was from no want of power or willingness on the part of God, that He had not come to the help of His people; the fault lay in their own sins.<\/p>",
