    "html": " <p>In the last days, Zion will be established in her glory (62:2). Her righteousness will be like a light to the world, which the Gentiles will see and approach (62:1-2). No longer will she be called forsaken or desolate (meaning divorced or widowed), but she will be known as a married woman (62:4). Zion will be cherished by the Lord as a bride is cherished by her bridegroom (62:5).<\/p> <p>The Lord counsels those who call on him to give him no rest until Jerusalem is restored and glorified (62:6-7). He promises that Israel will come to reap the rewards of her labors and that he will bring that blessing by the power of his arm (62:8-9). The way will be prepared for Israel to be gathered, and her people shall be called \"The holy people, The redeemed of the Lord\" (62:10-12).<\/p> <p>This chapter has two matching sets of six themes, repeated in sequence:<\/p> <p>A1&nbsp; The Lord will not hold his peace (62:1).<\/p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B1&nbsp; The watchmen will not hold their peace (62:6).<\/p> <p>A2&nbsp; Zion will shine brightly, attracting Gentiles and \"all kings\" (62:1-2).<\/p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B2&nbsp; Zion will be praised throughout the earth (62:7).<\/p> <p> A3&nbsp; Zion will be given a new name, the rightful reward for her righteousness<\/p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (62:2).<\/p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B3&nbsp; The people of Zion will be given food and drink, the rightful fruits of<\/p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; their labors (62:8).<\/p> <p>A4&nbsp; The people of Zion will be a royal crown and diadem in the Lord's hand<\/p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (62:3).<\/p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B4&nbsp; The people of Zion will be honored in the royal courts of God's holiness<\/p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (62:9).<\/p> <p>A5&nbsp; Zion will no longer be forsaken or desolate (62:4).<\/p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B5&nbsp; Zion will not be forsaken (62:12).<\/p> <p>A6&nbsp; The Lord will rejoice over Zion as a bridegroom rejoices over a bride (62:5).<\/p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B6&nbsp; The Lord promises salvation and reward (62:11). <\/p> <blockquote> <i>For Zion's sake<\/i> <u>will I not hold<\/u> my peace,     <br>and <i>for Jerusalem's sake<\/i> <u>I will not rest<\/u>,     <br>until <i>the righteousness thereof<\/i> go forth <u>as brightness<\/u>,     <br>and <i>the salvation thereof<\/i> <u>as a lamp that burneth<\/u>.
