Rather, Isaiah and his followers should let the Lord \"be [their] fear,\" for he is as a temple, a cornerstone, and sure foundation for those righteous ones who have placed their trust in him.<\/p> <blockquote> For the Lord spake thus to me with a strong hand,<b> <\/b>and instructed me that I should not walk in the way of this people, saying, (8:11)     <br><i>Say<\/i> ye not, <u>A [conspiracy<\/u>],     <br>to all to whom this people shall <i>say,<\/i> <u>A [conspiracy<\/u>];     <br><i>neither fear<\/i> ye their fear,     <br><i>nor be afraid.<\/i> (8:12)     <br><i>Sanctify the Lord of hosts<\/i> himself; and <u>let him be your fear<\/u>,     <br>and <u>let him be your dread<\/u>. (8:13) And <i>he shall be for a sanctuary;<\/i>     <br>but for a <i>stone of stumbling and for a rock of offence<\/i> to both the <u>houses of Israel<\/u>,     <br>for a <i>[trap] and for a snare<\/i> to the <i><u>inhabitants of Jerusalem<\/u>. (8:14)<\/i>     <br>And many among them shall <i>stumble, and fall,<\/i>     <br>and <i>be broken, and be snared, and be taken.<\/i> (8:15)<\/blockquote> ",
