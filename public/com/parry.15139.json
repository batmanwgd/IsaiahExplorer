    "title": "A Song about a \"Strong City\" and the \"Lofty City\"",
    "html": " <p>This song, which will be sung by \"the righteous nation which keepeth the truth\" at the time of the Second Coming, is about a \"strong city\" and the \"lofty city.\" The strong city is Zion, or Jerusalem. She has gates that only the righteous may enter. Her strength does not come from walls and bulwarks made of mortar and stone but from God's salvation. His power and everlasting strength will protect the city's inhabitants, who will enjoy perfect peace.<\/p> <p>By contrast, Jehovah will bring down those who dwell in the lofty city, where the wicked and proud are found. In fact, Jehovah will bring down this city \"even to the dust,\" and the feet of the poor and the needy will \"tread it down.\"<\/p> <blockquote>In that day shall this song be sung in the land of Judah;     <br>We have a strong city;     <br>salvation will God appoint for walls and [ramparts]. (26:1)     <br>Open ye [your gates],     <br>that the righteous nation which keepeth the truth may enter in. (26:2)     <br>Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace,     <br><i>whose mind [rests] <u>on thee<\/u>:<\/i>     <br><i>because he trusteth<\/i> <u>in thee<\/u>. (26:3)     <br><i>Trust<\/i> ye in the <u>Lord<\/u> for ever:     <br>for in the <u>Lord Jehovah<\/u> is everlasting <i>strength:<\/i> (26:4)     <br>For <i>he bringeth down<\/i> them that <u>dwell on high<\/u>;     <br>the <u>lofty city<\/u>, <i>he layeth it low;<\/i>     <br><i>he layeth it low,<\/i> even <u>to the ground<\/u>;     <br><i>he bringeth it<\/i> even <u>to the dust<\/u>. (26:5)     <br>The foot shall tread it down,     <br>even the <i>feet<\/i> of the <u>poor<\/u>,     <br>and the <i>steps<\/i> of the <u>needy<\/u>. (26:6)<\/blockquote> ",
