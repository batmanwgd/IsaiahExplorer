As God will not accept of that which cost nothing, so much less of that which is the effect of rapine and oppression. <i>And I will direct their work in truth <\/i>\u2014I will lead them so, that they shall do all things in sincerity. They shall do good works with good intentions, and to good ends: they shall love <i>truth, <\/i> and walk in <i>truth, <\/i> and serve God <i>in spirit and truth. I will make an everlasting covenant with them <\/i>\u2014Though they have broken covenant with me, yet I will renew my ancient covenant made with their fathers, confirmed with the blood of the Messiah; and it shall be everlasting, never to be abrogated. <i>And their seed shall be known among the Gentiles <\/i>\u2014That is, <i>eminently; <\/i> a promise of the increase of the church: such shall be their prosperity and multiplying, that they shall be known abroad by their great increase: or else the meaning is, the church shall have a seed of the <i>Gentiles; <\/i> whereas the church has been confined to one corner of the world, now it shall remain in one nation alone no more, but shall fill all the nations of the earth. <i>All shall acknowledge they are the seed which the Lord hath blessed <\/i>\u2014Such shall be the visible characters of God\u2019s love to them, and of God\u2019s grace in them. <\/p> ",
