The trees, representative of people (<a class=\"ref\">Judg. 9:15; Ezek. 31:8<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\">Hosea 14:8; Zech. 11:2<\/a>), now rejoice and sing because Satan has been cast down to hell.<\/p> <p><i>no woodsman is come up against us.<\/i> This implies that the king of Babylon had cut down some of the trees, or murdered the people. Thus the king was seeking to become like God, who has authority to end life. We recall also that Jehovah is the great forester identified in 10:33-34, and hence the king of Babylon attempts to imitate God's ability to cut down nations and peoples. Yet, as J. Alec Motyer observes, \"With exact justice the arrogant woodsman [the king of Babylon] has 'had the chop!'\" Satan, similarly, attempts to make people suffer the second death.<\/p> ",
