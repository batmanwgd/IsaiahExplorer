His exclamation <i>Woe is me<\/i> was uttered earlier when, in God's presence, he was conscious of his own sins (6:5). He now feels the pain of others' condemnation as deeply as he felt his own.<\/p> <p><i>treacherous dealers. <\/i>Isaiah's heartfelt sorrow is caused by the world's wickedness. The wicked have been treacherous in their hearts and have dealt treacherously with the innocent (21:2; 33:1). They have preyed on the weak, have sworn falsely both to their neighbors and to God (48:1), and have broken the everlasting covenant (24:5).<\/p> ",
