When, like Esau, they want their birthright back and are willing to slay their brothers for it (<a class=\"ref\">Genesis 27:41<\/a>), Jehovah intervenes to cut them off from his blessings and to lay waste their habitations (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 1:7; 21:2; 24:1; 42:15<\/a>). Their now uninhabitable land becomes a memorial of the damned for future generations (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 13:20-21; 14:22-23; 32:14; 66:24<\/a>). The hell on earth they leave behind that is a consequence of their wickedness foreshadows the foreboding world they inherit in the hereafter.<\/p>",
