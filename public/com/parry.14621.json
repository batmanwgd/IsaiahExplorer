Those who were once precious (like silver and wine) but have polluted themselves with the ways of the world are called <i>dross.<\/i> The Lord, through Ezekiel, said that \"the house of Israel is to me become dross&hellip;they are even the dross of silver\" (<a class=\"ref\">Ezek. 22:18<\/a>; see <a class=\"ref\">Ps. 119:119; Alma 34:29<\/a>). \"Silver can contain some alloy and still be silver, but <i>silver<\/i> which has <i>become dross<\/i> has suffered total degeneration. Similarly, as soon as wine is touched with water no particle of it remains undiluted.\" Sin corrupts us as water dilutes wine and dross contaminates precious metal.<\/p> ",
