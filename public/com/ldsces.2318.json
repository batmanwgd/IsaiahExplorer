    "html": " <p> <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODAxNiI6NH0=\">Isaiah 19:11&ndash;14 <\/a> clearly promises that the leaders of Egypt&rsquo;s major centers would be as fools and unable to save their nation. Zoan was Tanis, Noph was Memphis, and No was Thebes. The prophecy in verses 16&ndash;17 that in the latter days Judah would strike terror in the hearts of the Egyptians may have been partially fulfilled in some of the battles of those two nations during the 20th century. Verses 24&ndash;25 are of particular interest to Latter-day Saints, for they promise that Egypt and other nations of that part of the world will embrace the restored gospel. <\/p> <p class=\"cite\"> LDS Church Educational System Old Testament Student Manual, 1 Kings&ndash;Malachi, Religion 302, Chapter 14, Item 29 <\/p> ",
