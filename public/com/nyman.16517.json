Jesus' response to the scribe was that he was \"not far from the kingdom of God\" (<a class=\"ref\">Mark 12:28-34<\/a>). What the scribe apparently did not recognize was that Jesus was that God. Verse 21 adds that he is \"a just God and a <i>Saviour\"<\/i> (italics added). Jesus Christ was the Administrator of the world by \"divine investiture of authority,\" as explained by the First Presidency in an official statement in 1916 (see <i>Messages of the First Presidency,<\/i> 6 vols. [Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, Inc., 1965-75], 5: 31-34).<\/p>     ",
