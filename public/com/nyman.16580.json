The prophet Abinadi, after quoting the entire chapter of <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 53<\/a>, declared to the priests of King Noah that \"God himself shall come down among the children of men, and shall redeem his people\" (<a class=\"ref\">Mosiah 15:1<\/a>). All the prophets since the time of Adam had testified of Christ, yet the people would not believe that he was the Messiah spoken of by these prophets (see <a class=\"ref\">Rom. 10:16<\/a>). They would not believe, in spite of the miracles he performed among them, which revealed his power to be \"the arm of <i>the<\/i> Lord\" (see <a class=\"ref\">John 12:37-38<\/a>). This phrase is also used to designate the power of the Lord's second coming (see <a class=\"ref\">1 Ne. 22:10-11<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 45:47<\/a>). <\/p>     ",
