There is only <i>one<\/i> way that leads to God, not multiple paths. As the apostle Paul preached, there is but \"One Lord, one faith, one baptism.\" (<a class=\"ref\">Ephesians 4:5<\/a>.)<\/p>     <p>The invitation of the Lord to all is to come unto Him, to cast off the burdens of sin, and to be perfected in Him. (<a class=\"ref\">Matthew 11:28; 3 Nephi 12:20; Moroni 10:32<\/a>.) None are excluded, for \"he inviteth them all to come unto him and partake of his goodness; and he denieth none that come unto him.\" (<a class=\"ref\">2 Nephi 26:33<\/a>.) To come unto Christ means that one must disavow and turn away from all error, from anything that will prevent him or her from coming to a correct understanding of His doctrines, covenants, and saving ordinances.<\/p>",
