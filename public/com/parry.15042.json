    "html": " <p>This section contains a single prophecy directed to three groups: the Dedanite caravans, Tema's inhabitants, and Kedar's nomads. Isaiah prophesies that within a year many of Kedar's people will be destroyed (21:16-17). Refugees will flee the swords and bows of the conquering nation and escape the \"grievousness of war\" (21:15); Isaiah calls upon the inhabitants of Dedanim and Tema to provide water and food (21:13-14) for these fugitives from Kedar (21:15-16). No mention is made of who it is that will war against the nomads of Kedar.<\/p> <blockquote>The burden upon Arabia. In the forest in Arabia shall ye lodge, O ye travelling companies of Dedanim. (21:13)     <br>The inhabitants of the land of Tema brought water to him that was thirsty, they prevented with their bread him that fled. (21:14)     <br>For they fled from the swords, from the drawn sword, and from the bent bow, and from the grievousness of war. (21:15)     <br>For thus <i>hath the Lord said<\/i> unto me,     <br>Within a year, according to the years of an hireling, and all the <i>glory of Kedar <\/i><u>shall fail<\/u><i>:<\/i> (21:16)     <br>And the residue of the number of archers, the <i>mighty men of the children of Kedar,<\/i> <u>shall be diminished<\/u>:     <br>for the <i>Lord God of Israel hath spoken<\/i> it.
