Now as the cluster must not be destroyed because there is a blessing, a nutritive part in it; so Israel shall not be destroyed, because there are righteous persons in it. But as the bark and kernels are thrown away, when the wine is pressed out, so shall the sinners be purged away from among the just, and on their return from exile, shall not be permitted to enter into the land of Israel;\"<a class=\"ref\">Ezekiel 20:38<\/a> .<\/p> \n\n<p><em>For my servant's sakes \"For the sake of my servant\"\u2014<\/em> It is to be observed that one of the Koningsburg MSS. collated by Lilienthal points the word<span class=\"greek-hebrew\"> \u05e2\u05d1\u05d3\u05d9<\/span><span class=\"translit\"> abdi<\/span> , singular; that is, \"my servant,\" meaning the Messiah; and so read the Septuagint, which gives a very good sense.
