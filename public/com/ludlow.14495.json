    "html": " <p>The house of Israel&rsquo;s final complaint&mdash;that Israel has been robbed by the wicked&mdash;is refuted by the Lord&rsquo;s promise of godly vengeance. In an ironic twist of justice, the spoil and captives of Israel&rsquo;s adversaries will be taken from them and returned to Israel. The wicked oppressors who have attempted to take &ldquo;the prey&rdquo; from the Israelites and captivate the &ldquo;lawful&rdquo; children of Israel (v. 24) will be forced to eat their own flesh and drink their own blood in retribution for their evil crimes (v. 26). This prophecy will be fulfilled in the end of days as Christ&rsquo;s millennial kingdom is established.<\/p> <p>Isaiah completes the chapter by listing several names by which people will know the Savior. He testifies that the God of Israel is the &ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Savior,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Redeemer,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;mighty One of Jacob.&rdquo; These titles help clarify the glorious mission of the Savior and His magnificent sacrifice for the righteous Israelites. They help focus Israel&rsquo;s worship on their true God. And, as promised, eventually all flesh will know the Lord of this earth (v. 26; compare Isaiah 45:23).<\/p> <p>If we follow the counsel of the Lord, allowing Him to mold us into polished servants, acting as a light to the Gentiles, following the call of the Shepherd, clothing ourselves in righteousness, and assisting in the gathering of Israel, we too can partake of the endless posterity and eternal happiness provided by the atonement of our Savior.<\/p> ",
