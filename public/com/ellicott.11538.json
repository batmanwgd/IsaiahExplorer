It has to be remembered that the words had not yet received the special application given to it in <a class=\"ref\">Daniel 9:26<\/a>, and had been used of the theocratic kings, of Saul (<a class=\"ref\">1 Samuel 26:9; 1 Samuel 26:11; 1 Samuel 26:16<\/a>), of the house of David (<a class=\"ref\">2 Samuel 22:51; 2 Samuel 23:1<\/a>), and of the patriarch Abraham (<a class=\"ref\">Psalms 105:15<\/a>). What is meant, therefore, is that Cyrus, the future deliverer, would be as truly a king \u201cby the grace of God\u201d as David had been, not only, like Nebuchadnezzar, \u201ca servant of Jehovah\u201d (<a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 27:6; Jeremiah 43:10<\/a>), but \u201cfulfilling all his pleasure,\u201d whom He grasps by the right hand and guides. <\/p>\n <p>I will loose the loins.\u2014Literally, I will ungird, either as a general symbol of weakening, or specifically for disarming, the sword being suspended from the girdle. The \u201ctwo-leaved gates\u201d are those of kingly palaces; the \u201cgates,\u201d those of cities, which will have to open to him. The words here, and in the next verse, may have been used with a special reference to the \u201chundred brazen gates\u201d of Babylon (Herod. i. 179). <\/p>",
