    "html": "<p><em>Forasmuch as this people refuseth \"Because this people have rejected\" -<\/em>The gentle waters of Shiloah, a small fountain and brook just without Jerusalem, which supplied a pool within the city for the use of the inhabitants, is an apt emblem of the state of the kingdom and house of David, much reduced in its apparent strength, yet supported by the blessing of God; and is finely contrasted with the waters of the Euphrates, great, rapid, and impetuous; the image of the Babylonian empire, which God threatens to bring down like a mighty flood upon all these apostates of both kingdoms, as punishment for their manifold iniquities, and their contemptuous disregard of his promises. The brook and the river are put for the kingdoms to which they belong, and the different states of which respectively they most aptly represent. Juvenal, inveighing against the corruption of Rome by the importation of Asiatic manners, says, with great elegance, that \"the Orontes has been long discharging itself into the Tiber:\" - <\/p>\n\n<p>    <i>Jampridem Syrus in Tiberim defluxit Orontes<\/i>.<\/p>\n\n<p>And Virgil, to express the submission of some of the Eastern countries to the Roman arms, says: - <\/p>\n\n<p>   <i>Euphrates ibat jam mollior undis<\/i>.<\/p>\n\n<p>  <i>Aen. 8:726.<\/i><\/p><i>\n\n<\/i><p><i>   <\/i>\"The waters of the Euphrates now flowed more humbly and gently.\"<\/p>\n\n<p>But the happy contrast between the brook and the river gives a peculiar beauty to this passage of the prophet, with which the simple figure in the Roman poets, however beautiful, yet uncontrasted, cannot contend.<\/p>",
