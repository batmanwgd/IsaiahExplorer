This expression means that the whole land from east to west will become a place of safety and refuge for the Lord's people (<a class=\"ref\">Hosea 2:15<\/a>). <\/p> <p><i>a fold of flocks\/a place for the herds.<\/i> The wars, contention, and slavery to which Israel was repeatedly subjected will be replaced with a peaceful, pastoral lifestyle in the Millennium. Those who seek the Lord are blessed to live in peace.<\/p> <p><i>my people that have sought me.<\/i> Those who turn to the Lord with their hearts and deeds will be brought into his fold. This is in contrast to those in 65:11, who \"forsake the Lord\" (see also 65:1 in JST).<\/p> ",
