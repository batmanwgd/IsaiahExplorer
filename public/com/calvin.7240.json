    "html": "<p><i> For thou hast made of a city a heap.<\/i> Some refer this to Jerusalem; but I think that there is a change of the number, as is very customary with the prophets; for the Prophet does not speak merely of a single city, but of many cities, which he says will be reduced to heaps. As to the view held by some, that the Romans made Jerusalem a palace, it has nothing to do with the Prophet\u2019s meaning, which will be easily enough understood, if we keep in remembrance what has been already stated, that the Prophet does not confine his thoughts to those calamities by which the Lord afflicts many nations, but extends his view to the end of the chastisements. In this manner the Lord determined to tame and subdue the obstinacy of men, whom he would never have brought into subjection to him without having been broken down by various afflictions.<\/p> \n<p><i> A palace of foreigners,<\/i><i> that it may not be a city.<\/i> The Prophet does not merely mean that, when the natives have been driven out, \u201cforeigners\u201d wil1 inhabit the cities which have been taken; for that would not agree with what he immediately adds, \u201cthat it may be no longer a city;\u201d but that wandering bands of men who shall be in want of a habitation will there find abundance of room, because there will be no inhabitants left. Since<span class=\"greek-hebrew\"> \u05d0\u05e8\u05de\u05d5\u05df<\/span> (<i> arm\u014dn<\/i>) denotes a magnificent palace, the Prophet thus says ironically, that highwaymen will dwell as in palaces, on account of the vast extent of the place which shall be deserted.<\/p> ",
