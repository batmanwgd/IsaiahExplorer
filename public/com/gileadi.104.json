    "html": " <p>The verb &ldquo;go&rdquo; denotes Jehovah&rsquo;s actual commission of Isaiah as his prophet. The terms &ldquo;these people&rdquo; or &ldquo;this people&rdquo; (<em>ha&lsquo;am hazzeh <\/em>), however, reflect the people&rsquo;s repudiation of their covenant relationship with Jehovah that is commonly expressed by the possessive &ldquo; <em>my <\/em> people&rdquo; (<em>&lsquo;ammi <\/em>). When they grow alienated, they see things their way, not his (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODc0OSI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 55:8-9<\/a>). Hence the words, &ldquo;Go on hearing, but not understanding; Go on seeing, but not perceiving.&rdquo; As Jehovah forewarns, a wayward people&rsquo;s typical response when a prophet appeals to them to repent is to harden their hearts and dull their senses. <\/p> <p>Although Isaiah&rsquo;s role as a hardener of his people&rsquo;s hearts seals upon them Jehovah&rsquo;s condemnation, there exists a redeeming side to his prophetic ministry. &ldquo;Seeing&rdquo; with the eyes, &ldquo;hearing&rdquo; with the ears, &ldquo;understanding&rdquo; in the heart, and &ldquo;repenting&rdquo; at the same time constitutes Jehovah&rsquo;s formula for &ldquo;healing&rdquo; or salvation. A remnant of Jehovah&rsquo;s people&mdash;a &ldquo;holy offspring&rdquo; comprised of those who repent (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzgzXQ==\">v 13<\/a>)&mdash;thus survives destruction in his Day of Judgment. Typifying them are Isaiah&rsquo;s disciples, for whom Jehovah provides sanctuary at the time others suffer covenant curses (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzgyMSI6NX0=\">Isaiah 8:13-17<\/a>). <\/p> ",
