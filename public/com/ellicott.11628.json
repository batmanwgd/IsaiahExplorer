He came in the deliverance from Babylon, in a promise of still greater blessings, in the fullest sense, in and through His Servant, and yet none came to help in the work, or even to receive the message. (Comp. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 63:3<\/a>.) Not that He needed human helpers. In words that remind us, in their sequence, of the phenomena of the plagues of Egypt, the prophet piles up the mighty works of which He is capable. The words are echoed in <a class=\"ref\">Revelation 6:12; Revelation 8:9; Revelation 8:12<\/a>.<\/p>",
