Its citizens, the Chaldeans, once admired throughout the earth for creating this model of opulence, become synonymous with the curse of Sodom and Gomorrah. Babylon and all who are identified with it&mdash;the sinners and wicked of the earth and the world (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MDQ1LDE4MDQ3XQ==\">vv 9, 11<\/a>)&mdash;disappear forever (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc5NTEiOjJ9LFsxODA0NV0seyIxODYwMSI6MTV9XQ==\">Isaiah 14:22-23; 21:9; 47:1-15<\/a>).<\/p>",
