Probably here, as in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MDM3XQ==\">Isaiah 21:1<\/a>, and <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MDU0XQ==\">Isaiah 22:1<\/a>, we have a mystical prophetic name, Edom being altered to Dumah, i.e., \u201csilence,\u201d as in <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 94:17; Psalms 115:17<\/a>, the silence of the grave. In this case, as in the preceding, there is first the oppressive silence of expectancy, and then of desolation. <\/p>\n <p>He calleth . . . out of Seir . . .\u2014The subject is indefinite: one calleth. The watchman hears the silence of the night broken by a voice from Seir. It is probable that the prophet had actually been consulted by the Edomites, and that this is his answer to their enquiries. The cry is, \u201cWatchman, what part of the night?\u201d In the weary night of calamity the sufferer desires to know what hour it is, how much of the darkness still remains to be lived through. The answer is mysterious and ill-boding. There is a \u201cmorning\u201d coming, a time of light and hope, but the day which is so opened closes too quickly in the blackness of night (<a class=\"ref\">Amos 5:18<\/a>). The words sum up the whole future of Edom, subject as it was to one conqueror after another, rising now and then, as under Herod and the Romans, and then sinking to its present desolation. <\/p>",
