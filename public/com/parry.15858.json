    "html": " <i>delight thyself in the Lord.<\/i> If we obey the Sabbath with pure hearts, not only will we find joy in our obedience but we will find joy in the Lord himself.<\/p> <p><i>high places of the earth.<\/i> The holy mount, or the temple, would be the high places on which the Lord treads (<a class=\"ref\">Deut. 33:29; Micah 1:2-3<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\">Hab. 3:19<\/a>). Thus, those mortals who \"ride upon the high places\" are those who are blessed to be where the Lord is. This verse compares very closely with <a class=\"ref\">Deut. 32:13<\/a>, which speaks of Israel's conquest of Canaan. Thus Isaiah's prophecy may refer to the renewal of the covenant between God and Israel and to the reconquest of the promised land.<\/p> <p><i>feed thee with the heritage of Jacob.<\/i> When we keep the Sabbath, the Lord will enable us to partake freely of the blessings promised to Jacob.<\/p> <p><i>the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.<\/i> This passage testifies of the source of the promises in this passage. The same words are recorded in 1:20 and 40:5.<\/p> ",
