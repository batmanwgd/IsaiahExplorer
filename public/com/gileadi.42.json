    "html": "<p>While the preceding passage depicts the idolatry and pride of Jehovah&rsquo;s people (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzY5MiI6N30=\">vv 6-12<\/a>), this passage portrays Jehovah&rsquo;s Day of Judgment coming on a series of geo-physical objects. That disparity is resolved when we discern the objects&rsquo; metaphorical meaning: they, too, represent peoples and their transitory human establishment: &ldquo;Mountains&rdquo; and &ldquo;hills&rdquo; represent large and small nations (cf.<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzY4OCI6Mn0=\">vv 2-3<\/a>); &ldquo;cedars&rdquo; and &ldquo;oaks&rdquo; designate people (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3OTM3LDE4ODQ3XQ==\">Isaiah 14:8; 61:3<\/a> ;<a class=\"ref\">Psalm 92:12<\/a>); &ldquo;towers&rdquo; and &ldquo;walls&rdquo; signify human institutions (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzQ1LDE4MjMxLDE4MjQzXQ==\">Isaiah 5:5; 30:13, 25<\/a>); &ldquo;ships&rdquo; denote the shipping industry (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MDc5LDE4MDkyXQ==\">Isaiah 23:1, 14<\/a>).<\/p><p>In a real sense Jehovah&rsquo;s Day of Judgment is also the day of the king of Assyria\/Babylon (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxNzgwMF0seyIxNzk0NSI6Mn1d\">Isaiah 7:17; 14:16-17<\/a>). Like a mythical Mesopotamian god, the archtyrant goes a-conquering and cuts down the cedars of Lebanon: &ldquo;On account of my vast chariotry I have conquered the highest mountains, the farthest reaches of Lebanon. I have felled its tallest cedars, its choicest cypresses. I have reached its loftiest summit, its finest forest&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4Mzc3XQ==\">Isaiah 37:24<\/a> ; cf.<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODU2LDE3ODY2XQ==\">10:5, 15<\/a>). The Hebrew prophets thus use the name &ldquo;Lebanon&rdquo; to figuratively represent Jehovah&rsquo;s people Israel (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODM1XQ==\">Isaiah 60:13<\/a> ;<a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 22:23; Ezekiel 17:3<\/a>).<\/p> ",
