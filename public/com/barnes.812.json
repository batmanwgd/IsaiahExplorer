It is an emphatic mode of speaking&mdash;expressing deep abhorrence and suddenness of denunciation. &lsquo;Woe to the impious! Ill!&rsquo; <\/p> <p> <em>For the reward of his hands <\/em>&mdash;Of his conduct. The hands are the instruments by which we accomplish anything, and hence, they are put for the whole man. <\/p> <p> <em>Shall be given him <\/em>&mdash;That is, shall be repaid to him; or he shall be justly recompensed for his crimes. This is the principle on which God rules the world. It shall be well here and hereafter, with those who obey God; it shall be ill here and forever, with those who disobey him. <\/p> ",
