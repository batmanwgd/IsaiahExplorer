    "html": " <p> <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isa. 31<\/a> may be divided into two parts. Part one, 31:1-3, prophesies woe unto all who rely on the arm of flesh rather than on God. Specifically, Judah had relied on Egypt's military powers for deliverance rather than trusting in God, but the woe applies to us if we rely on our armies, weapons of war, or other means of temporal deliverance, or security, rather than on our God.<\/p> <p>Part two, 31:4-9, speaks mainly to us today. If we, who are part of Zion, will cast away our wickedness as one casts away false gods, then the Lord will defend Zion. He will be like a mighty lion, \"roaring on his prey\" (31:4), or like a bird, flying protectively over her nestlings to preserve them; he will use his mighty sword to protect Zion.<\/p> <blockquote> Woe to them that go down to <u>Egypt<\/u> for <i>help;<\/i>     <br>and <i>stay<\/i> on <u>horses<\/u><i>,<\/i>     <br>and <i>trust<\/i> in <u>chariots<\/u><i>,<\/i> because they are many;     <br>and in <u>horsemen<\/u><i>,<\/i> because they are very strong;     <br>but they <i>look<\/i> not unto the <u>Holy One of Israel<\/u><i>,<\/i>     <br>neither <i>seek<\/i> the <u>Lord<\/u>! (31:1)     <br>Yet he also is wise, and will <i>bring evil,<\/i>     <br>and will <i>not call back his words:<\/i>     <br>but will arise<i> against<\/i> <i>the house<\/i> of the <u>evildoers<\/u><i>,<\/i>     <br>and <i>against the help<\/i> of <u>them that work iniquity<\/u><i>.<\/i> (31:2)     <br>Now the <i>Egyptians<\/i> are <u>men<\/u><i>,<\/i> and not God;     <br>and <i>their horses<\/i> <u>flesh<\/u><i>,<\/i> and not spirit.     <br>When the Lord shall stretch out his hand,     <br>both <i>he that helpeth<\/i> <u>shall fall<\/u><i>,<\/i>     <br>and <i>he that is [helped<\/i>] <u>shall fall down<\/u><i>,<\/i>     <br>and <i>they all<\/i> <u>shall fail<\/u> together. (31:3)     <br>For thus hath the Lord spoken unto me,     <br>Like as the lion and the young lion roaring on his prey,     <br>when a multitude of shepherds is called forth against him,     <br>he will not <i>be afraid<\/i> of <u>their voice<\/u><i>,<\/i>     <br>nor <i>abase himself<\/i> for the <u>noise of them<\/u>:     <br>so shall the <i>Lord of hosts<\/i> come down to fight<i> <\/i><u>for mount Zion<\/u><i>,<\/i>     <br>and <u>for the hill<\/u> thereof. (31:4)     <br>As birds flying, so will the <i>Lord of hosts<\/i> <u>defend Jerusalem<\/u>;     <br>defending also <i>he<\/i> <u>will deliver it<\/u>;     <br>and passing over <i>he<\/i> <u>will preserve it<\/u><i>.<\/i> (31:5)     <br>Turn ye unto him from whom the children of Israel have deeply revolted. (31:6)     <br>For in that day every man shall cast away his <i>idols<\/i> of <u>silver<\/u><i>,<\/i>     <br>and his <i>idols<\/i> of <u>gold<\/u><i>,<\/i> which your own hands have made unto you for a sin. (31:7)     <br>Then shall the Assyrian fall with <i>the sword,<\/i> <u>not of a mighty man<\/u>;     <br>and <i>the sword,<\/i> <u>not of a mean man<\/u><i>,<\/i> shall devour him:     <br>but <i>he<\/i> shall <u>flee from the sword<\/u><i>,<\/i>     <br>and <i>his young men<\/i> shall <u>be discomfited<\/u><i>.<\/i> (31:8)     <br>And <i>he<\/i> shall pass over to his strong hold for <u>fear<\/u><i>,<\/i>     <br>and <i>his princes<\/i> shall <u>be afraid<\/u> of the ensign,     <br>saith the Lord, whose <i>fire<\/i> is in <u>Zion<\/u><i>,<\/i>     <br>and his <i>furnace<\/i> in <u>Jerusalem<\/u><i>.<\/i> (31:9)<\/blockquote> ",
