See chap. 7:17, &c. For this is of nearly the same argument, except that it is more extensive, and involves many more mysteries. The first part is entirely prophetical, from this to <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTc4MTk=\">Isaiah 8:11<\/a>, and contains a declaration of the events of the subsequent period, immediately leading to the time of fulfilling the promise respecting Immanuel: of these events, the first is the subversion of Ephraim, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzgxNCI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 8:6-7<\/a>; the second, the affliction of Judah, by the Assyrians also, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTc4MTY=\">Isaiah 8:8<\/a>; the third, the destruction of the hostile counsels and attempts of future times, which seemed to threaten a total excision of the church of God, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzgxNyI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 8:9-10<\/a>.\u201d \u2014 Vitringa and Dodd.<\/p>",
