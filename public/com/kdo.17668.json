    "html": "<p> Therefore judgment would overtake them in this blind, dull, and stupid animal condition. <em> \u201cTherefore my people go into banishment without knowing; and their glory will become starving men, and their tumult men dried up with thirst.\u201d<\/em> As the word <em> \u201ctherefore\u201d<\/em> (<em> la\u0302ce\u0304n <\/em> , as in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3Njc5XQ==\">Isaiah 1:24<\/a>) introduces the threat of punishment, <em> ga\u0302la\u0302h <\/em> (go into captivity) is a prophetic preterite. Israel would go into exile, and that \u201cwithout knowing\u201d (<em> m ibb'li<\/em> -<em> da'ath <\/em> ). The meaning of this expression cannot be \u201cfrom want of knowledge,\u201d since the <em> min<\/em> which is fused into one word with <em> b'li <\/em> is not causal, but negative, and <em> m ibb'li <\/em> , as a preposition, always signifies \u201cwithout\u201d (<em> absque <\/em> ). But are we to render it \u201cwithout knowing it\u201d (as in <a class=\"ref\">Hosea 4:6<\/a>, where <em> hadda'ath <\/em> has the article), or \u201cunawares?\u201d There is no necessity for any dispute on this point, since the two renderings are fundamentally one and the same. The knowledge, of which <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzUyXQ==\">Isaiah 5:12<\/a> pronounces them destitute, was more especially a knowledge of the judgment of God that was hanging over them; so that, as the captivity would come upon them without knowledge, it would necessarily come upon them unawares. \u201cTheir glory\u201d (<em> C ebo\u0304do\u0304 <\/em> ) and <em> \u201ctheir tumult\u201d<\/em> (<em> hamono <\/em> ) are therefore to be understood, as the predicates show, as collective nouns used in a personal sense, the former signifying the more select portion of the nation (cf., <a class=\"ref\">Micah 1:15<\/a>), the latter the mass of the people, who were living in rioting and tumult. The former would become <em> \u201cmen of famine\u201d<\/em> (<em> m e\u0306the\u0304 <\/em> <em> ra\u0302a\u0302b <\/em> : \u05de\u05ea\u05d9 , like \u05d0\u05e0\u05e9\u05c1\u05d9 in other places, viz., <a class=\"ref\">2 Samuel 19:29<\/a>, or \u05d1\u05bc\u05e0\u05d9 , <a class=\"ref\">1 Samuel 26:16<\/a>); the latter <em> \u201cmen dried up with thirst\u201d<\/em> (<em> tsiche\u0304h <\/em> <em> tsa\u0302ma\u0302h <\/em> : the same number as the subject). There is no necessity to read \u05de\u05ea\u05d9 (dead men) instead of \u05de\u05ea\u05d9 , as the lxx and Vulgate do, or \u05de\u05d6\u05d9 ( \u05de\u05d6\u05d4 ) according to <a class=\"ref\">Deuteronomy 32:24<\/a>, as Hitzig, Ewald, B\u00f6ttcher, and others propose (compare, on the contrary, <a class=\"ref\">Genesis 34:30<\/a> and <a class=\"ref\">Job 11:11<\/a>). The adjective <em> tzicheh <\/em> (<em> hapax <\/em> <em> leg <\/em> ) is formed like <em> C hire\u0304sh <\/em> , <em> C e\u0304heh <\/em> , and other adjectives which indicate defects: in such formations from verbs <em> Lamed<\/em> - <em> He <\/em> , instead of <em> e<\/em> we have an <em> ae<\/em> that has grown out of <em> ay<\/em> (Olshausen, \u00a7182, <em> b<\/em> ). The rich gluttons would starve, and the tippling crowd would die with thirst.<\/p>",
