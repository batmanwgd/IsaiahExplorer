Isaiah's invitation is to the wicked inhabitants of the nations, the gentile nations, to call upon the Lord so that they may receive his mercy and receive a remission of their sins. The modern priesthood holders were called to go to those wicked nations and cry repentance. Thus the two references fit into the same time period and context.<\/p>     <p>Several of the Brethren have quoted these two verses to illustrate the principles of revelation and repentance.<\/p>     ",
