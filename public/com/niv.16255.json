He begins by referring to the past. The people have heard all the predictions God has made, and they know all his predictions have come true (48:3). He made the predictions precisely so that when the events occurred, it would be impossible to say that some idol god performed the actions (48:4\u20135). In 48:6a, Isaiah calls the people to \u201cadmit\u201d the truth of their experience and to draw the appropriate conclusions from that experience.<\/p>     <p>\u2003Then in 48:6b, the prophet turns to the future. He will predict new things that have not been heard before. What these things are, are not specified, and indeed that is not the point of the statement. The point is that God can do new things, something the idols cannot do. He is the Creator and can therefore say and do things that have never happened before. He is doing this precisely so that no one can \u201cdefame\u201d him by comparing him to an idol and so that no idol may share his \u201cglory\u201d (48:11).<\/p>     ",
