This prophecy, strangely enough, is pronounced on the beasts, the camels and asses belonging to Judah's leaders, who are using them to transport their gifts and bribes to Egypt. Ironically, the children of Israel once escaped bondage through the Negev (<i>south<\/i>) carrying Egypt's treasures with them (<a class=\"ref\">Ex. 11:2<\/a>), but now they return with the treasures of Jerusalem to purchase an alliance, another form of bondage. The beasts may represent Judah's leaders.<\/p> <p><i>young and old lion\/viper\/fiery flying serpent. <\/i>These same creatures plagued the Israelites as they escaped Egypt's pharaoh and armies (<a class=\"ref\">Num. 21:4-6; Deut. 8:15<\/a>; see the discussion of <i>fiery<\/i> <i>flying<\/i> <i>serpent <\/i>in<i> <\/i>commentary on 14:29).<\/p> <p><i>they will carry their riches upon&hellip;young asses.<\/i> Judah's leaders will carry gifts to Egypt, a people that shall not profit them. Similarly, we sometimes devote our time, energy, or resources (our riches) to purposes or causes that are contrary to God's will. In the end, all such activities will not profit us.<\/p> ",
