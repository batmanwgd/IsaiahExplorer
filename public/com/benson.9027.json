As I have called them to this work, so I will assist them in it. <i>None shall slumber nor sleep<\/i>\u2014They shall all be watchful and diligent to take all opportunities of executing my judgments. <i>Nor the latchet, &c., be broken<\/i> \u2014<i><\/i> I will take all impediments out of their way. <i>Whose arrows are sharp<\/i>\u2014Who are every way furnished and ready for my work, waiting only for my command. <i>Their horses\u2019 hoofs like flint \u2014<\/i> Because they shall not be broken or battered by the length or stoniness and ruggedness of the way. <i>And their wheels like a whirlwind<\/i>\u2014For the swiftness of their march, and for the force and violence of their chariots in battle. <i>They shall roar like young lions<\/i>\u2014Which signifies both their cruelty, and their eagerness to catch and devour the prey. <i>They shall lay hold on the prey,<\/i> &c.\u2014These words do not agree to the Assyrians, for they were forced to retreat with great shame and loss, and the Jews were delivered from them: but they agree perfectly both to the Chaldeans and the Romans, both of whom<i>carried the prey away safe, and none delivered it \u2014<\/i> That is, neither the Jews themselves, nor any of their confederates, to whose help they trusted.<\/p> ",
