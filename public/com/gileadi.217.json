These, however, are synonymous ideas: &ldquo;Their arrows are sharp; all their bows are strung. The tread of their warhorses resembles flint; their chariot wheels revolve like a whirlwind. They have the roar of a<em>lion<\/em> ; they are aroused like young lions: growling, they seize the prey, and escape, and none comes to the rescue&rdquo; ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzc2OCI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 5:28-29<\/a>; emphasis added). Jehovah&rsquo;s righteous people, on the other hand, are gathered out: &ldquo;The ransomed of Jehovah shall return; they shall come singing to Zion&rdquo; ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MzMxXQ==\">Isaiah 35:10<\/a>).<\/p> ",
