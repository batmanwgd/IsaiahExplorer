    "html": "<p>Jerusalem, in manifest allusion to the strong figure employed in the close of the preceding chapter, is represented as fallen asleep in the dust, and in that helpless state bound by her enemies. The prophet, with all the ardor natural to one who had such joyful news to communicate, bids her awake, arise, put on her best attire, (holiness to the Lord), and ascend her lofty seat; and then he delivers the message he had in charge, a very consolatory part of which was, that \"no more should enter into her the uncircumcised and the polluted,\" <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODY5OCI6Nn0=\">Isaiah 52:1-6<\/a>. Awaking from her stupefaction, Jerusalem sees the messenger of such joyful tidings on the eminence from which he spied the coming deliverance. She expresses, in beautiful terms, her joy at the news, repeating with peculiar elegance the words of the crier, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzA0XQ==\">Isaiah 52:7<\/a>. The rapturous intelligence, that Jehovah was returning to resume his residence on his holy mountain, immediately spreads to others on the watch, who all join in the glad acclamation, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzA1XQ==\">Isaiah 52:8<\/a>; and, in the ardor of their joy, they call to the very ruins of Jerusalem to sing along with them, because Jehovah maketh bare his holy arm in the sight of all the nations, and all the ends of the earth are about to see the salvation of Israel's God, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzA2XQ==\">Isaiah 52:9<\/a> , <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzA3XQ==\">Isaiah 52:10<\/a>. To complete the deliverance, they are commanded to march in triumph out of Babylon, earnestly exhorted to have nothing to do with any of her abominations, and assured that Jehovah will guide them in all their way, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzA4XQ==\">Isaiah 52:11<\/a> , <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzA5XQ==\">Isaiah 52:12<\/a>. The prophet then passes to the procuring cause of this great blessedness to the house of Israel in particular, and to the world in general, viz., the humiliation, sufferings, death, burial, resurrection, and ascension of Jesus Christ; a very celebrated and clear prophet which takes up the remainder of this and the whole of the following chapter.<\/p> ",
