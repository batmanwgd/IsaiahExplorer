    "html": "<p><b>(<a class=\"ref\">3 Nephi 22:13<\/a>).<\/b>\"<i>Great shall be the peace of thy children.<\/i>\" This verse may have specific reference to millennial conditions, when \"children shall grow up without sin unto salvation.\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 45:58<\/a>.) It may also imply that there will be some direct teaching of these blessed children by the Lord Himself. However, there may be a more immediate application. This entire verse is used by the Primary of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as its general theme. The goal of the Church and righteous parents everywhere is to teach the children about their Heavenly Father and their Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, that the peace of righteousness might prevail in their lives.<\/p>     <p>In speaking of Isaiah's promise of peace to the children, President Spencer W. Kimball, twelfth prophet of the Lord in the latter days, said, \"Surely every good parent would like this peace for his offspring. It comes from the simple life of the true Latter-day Saint as he makes his home and family supreme.\" (<i>Ensign,<\/i> July 1973, p. 16.)<\/p>     <p>The Savior's tender feelings for children were evident in His mortal ministry in the Holy Land (JST Matthew 19:13-15), as well as in His postmortal ministry in the Americas, where \"he took their little children, one by one, and blessed them, and prayed unto the Father for them.\" (<a class=\"ref\">3 Nephi 17:21<\/a>.) Furthermore, in a revelation given in 1831, He specifically charged parents with teaching their children \"the doctrine of repentance, faith in Christ the Son of the living God, and of baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of the hands.\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 68:25<\/a>.)<\/p>",
