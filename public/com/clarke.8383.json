    "html": "<p><em>A city \"The city\" -<\/em>Nineveh, Babylon, Ar, Moab, or any other strong fortress possessed by the enemies of the people of God.<\/p>\n\n<p>For the first <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05de\u05e2\u05d9\u05e8 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">meir<\/span>, of a city, the Syriac and Vulgate read <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d4\u05e2\u05d9\u05e8 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">hair<\/span>, the city; the Septuagint and Chaldee read <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05e2\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">arim<\/span>, cities, in the plural, transposing the letters. After the second <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05de\u05e2\u05d9\u05e8 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">meir<\/span>, a MS. adds <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05dc\u05d2\u05dc <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">lagol<\/span>, for a heap.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>A palace of strangers \"The palace of the proud ones\" -<\/em>For <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d6\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">zarim<\/span>, strangers, MS. Bodl. and another read <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d6\u05d3\u05d9\u05dd <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">zedim<\/span>, the proud: so likewise the Septuagint; for they render it <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u03b1\u03c3\u03b5\u03b2\u03c9\u03bd<\/span>  here, and in  <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTgxMjQ=\">Isaiah 25:5<\/a>, as they do in some other places: see  <a class=\"ref\">Deuteronomy 18:20,  Deuteronomy 18:22<\/a>. Another MS. reads <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05e6\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">tsarim<\/span>, adversaries; which also makes a good sense. But <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d6\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">zarim<\/span>, strangers, and <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d6\u05d3\u05d9\u05dd <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">zedim<\/span>, the proud, are often confounded by the great similitude of the letters <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d3 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">daleth<\/span>  and <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05e8 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">resh<\/span> . See  <a class=\"ref\">Malachi 3:15;  Malachi 4:1;  Psalm 19:14<\/a>, in the Septuagint; and  <a class=\"ref\">Psalm 54:5<\/a>, where the Chaldee reads <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d6\u05d3\u05d9\u05dd <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">zedim<\/span>, compared with  <a class=\"ref\">Psalm 86:16<\/a>.<\/p>",
