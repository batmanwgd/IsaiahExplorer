    "html": " <i>draw iniquity with cords of vanity\/sin as&hellip;a cart rope.<\/i> The image is of a beast of burden, such as a donkey or ox (representative of a wicked person), pulling a cart of goods (representing sins). The wicked are burdened with sins, which they must drag behind them, just as a beast of burden hauls its load from place to place. The verse also seems to suggest that vanity is the key component from which our cords are made. We commit a sin and then drag it after us because of our vanity and pride. <i>Vanity<\/i> also means uselessness or emptiness, an interesting image. Sin is sometimes as difficult to break as a thick rope that is strong enough to pull a cart, but it is possible to break sin with the help of Christ: \"Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest\" (<a class=\"ref\">Matt. 11:28<\/a>). <\/p> ",
