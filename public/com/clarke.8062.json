Sacrifices and prayers are not profitable to the offerer, nor acceptable to the gods, unless accompanied with an upright life.<\/p> \n\n<p><em>The fat of fed beasts, etc.\u2014<\/em> The fat and the blood are particularly mentioned, because these were in all sacrifices set apart to God. The fat was always burnt upon the altar, and the blood was partly sprinkled, differently on different occasions, and partly poured out at the bottom of the altar. See Leviticus 4.<\/p> ",
