Isaiah acts on the method of Nathan when he said, \u201cThou art the man.\u201d He has painted the drunkards of Ephraim; now he turns and paints in yet darker colours the drunkards of Judah. Priests were seen reeling to their services, prophets reeling in the very act of their counterfeit inspiration. The threefold iteration of the word for \u201creel\u201d emphasises the scandals of the scene. The sins of the sons of Eli, those of which Micah (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3Njk3XQ==\">Isaiah 2:11 <\/a>) had spoken, were reproduced in all their enormity. The most loathsome features of their drunkenness are printed in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTczXQ==\">Isaiah 28:8 <\/a> with a boldness which is almost photographic. The prohibition of wine during the time when the priests were on duty (<a class=\"ref\">Leviticus 10:1-9 <\/a>) adds to the guilt thus represented. <\/p> ",
