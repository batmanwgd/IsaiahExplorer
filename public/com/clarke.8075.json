I have seen this done with the naked hand, and no injury whatever sustained.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Purge away thy dross \"In the furnace\" -<\/em>The text has <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05db\u05d1\u05e8 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">cabbor<\/span>, which some render \"as with soap;\" as if it were the same with <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05db\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05ea <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">keborith<\/span> ; so Kimchi; but soap can have nothing to do with the purifying of metals. Others, \"according to purity,\" or \"purely,\" as our version. Le Clerc conjectured that the true reading is <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05db\u05db\u05d5\u05e8 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">kechur<\/span>, \"as in the furnace;\" see  <a class=\"ref\">Ezekiel 22:18,  Ezekiel 22:20<\/a>. Dr. Durell proposes only a transposition of letters <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d1\u05db\u05e8 <\/span>  to the same sense; and so likewise Archbishop Secker. That this is the true reading is highly probable.<\/p>",
