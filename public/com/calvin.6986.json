    "html": " <p> <i>Is not Calno as Carchemish?<\/i>, Here he mentions by name certain cities, though others think that they were countries; but it is more probable that they were cities, or some fortified places. \u201cShall it not happen,\u201d says he, \u201cto those places which I have not yet subdued as it has happened to others that opposed me?\u201d He therefore compares <i>Calno<\/i>, <i>Arpad<\/i>, and <i>Samaria<\/i>, which he afterwards subdued, to <i>Carchemish<\/i>, <i>Hamath<\/i>, and <i>Damascus<\/i>, which he had formerly subdued, and says that those will not be stronger than these. Thus wicked men are wont to boast and talk proudly of their former actions, so as to imagine that they will break through every obstruction, and that nothing can stand in the way of their plans and exertions, and even think that they will accomplish everything without the will or knowledge of God. <\/p>\n <p>When we read this history, let us learn that we ought not to be proud of having been strong, or of having succeeded to our wish; for he who hath exalted us will be able to cast us down. And if he reproves the Assyrian for that haughtiness, how much more ought they to be reproved who ascribe to themselves the praise of righteousness and holiness, as if they could be regenerated by their own power; for it cannot be doubted that they rob God of his honor, and claim for themselves what belongs to him! <\/p>",
