    "html": "<p> The consolatory words, \u201cFear not,\u201d are now repeated, for the purpose of once more adding the promise that Israel will not succumb to its foes, but will acquire power over its enemies. <em> \u201cFear not, thou worm Jacob, and handful Israel: I will help thee, saith Jehovah; and thy Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel. Behold, I have made thee a threshing roller, a sharp new one, with double edges: thou wilt thresh mountains, and pound them; and hills thou wilt make like chaff. Thou wilt winnow them, and wind carries them away, and tempest scatters them: and thou wilt rejoice in Jehovah, and glory in the Holy One of Israel.\u201d<\/em> Israel, which is now helplessly oppressed, is called \u201cworm of Jacob\u201d (<em> gen. appos.<\/em> ) in compassion, i.e., Jacob that is like a worm, probably with some allusion to <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 22:7<\/a>; for the image of the Messiah enriches itself in these discourses, inasmuch as Israel itself is looked upon in a Messianic light, so that the second David does not stand by the side of Israel, but appears as Israel's heart, or true and inmost essence. The people are then addressed as the \u201cpeople of Israel,\u201d with some allusion to the phrase \u05de\u05e1\u05e4\u05bc\u05e8 \u05de\u05ea\u05d9 (i.e., few men, easily numbered) in <a class=\"ref\">Genesis 34:30; Deuteronomy 4:27<\/a> (lxx \u03bf\u0313\u03bb\u03b9\u03b3\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u0300\u03c3 \u0313\u0399\u03c3\u03c1\u03b1\u03b7\u0301\u03bb ; Luther, <em> Ir armer hauffe Israel <\/em> , ye poor crowd of Israel). They no longer formed the compact mass of a nation; the band of the commonwealth was broken: they were melted down into a few individuals, scattered about hither and thither. But it would not continue so. \u201cI help thee\u201d (perfect of certainty) is Jehovah's solemn declaration; and the Redeemer (<em> redemtor<\/em> , <a class=\"ref\">Leviticus 25:48-49<\/a>) of His now enslaved people is the Holy One of Israel, with His love, which perpetually triumphs over wrath. Not only will He set it free, but He will also endow it with might over its oppressors; <em> samt\u0131\u0304kh <\/em> is a perfect of assurance (Ges. \u00a7126, 4); <em> m o\u0304rag <\/em> (roller) signifies a threshing-sledge (Arab. <em> naureg <\/em> , <em> no\u0304reg <\/em> ), which has here the term \u05d7\u05e8\u05d5\u05bc \u05e5 (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTkyXQ==\">Isaiah 28:27<\/a>) as a secondary name along with \u05d7\u05d3\u05e9\u05c1 , and is described as furnished on the under part of the two arms of the sledge not only with sharp knives, but with two-edged knives ( \u05e4\u05bc\u05d9\u05e4\u05d9\u05bc\u05d5\u05ea a reduplication, like \u05de\u05d0\u05e1\u05bc\u05d0\u05d4 in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTYwXQ==\">Isaiah 27:8<\/a>, whereas \u05de\u05d9\u05de\u05d9 is a double plural). Just like such a threshing machine would Israel thresh and grind to powder from that time forth both mountains and hills. This is evidently a figurative expression for proud and mighty foes, just as wind and tempest denote the irresistible force of Jehovah's aid. The might of the enemy would be broken down to the very last remnant, whereas Israel would be able to rejoice and glory in its God.<\/p>",
