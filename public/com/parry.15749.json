In his revelation, John the Beloved witnessed the same plea: \"And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues\" (<a class=\"ref\">Rev. 18:4<\/a>). <\/p> <p><i>touch not that which is unclean.<\/i> We as the Lord's covenant people must not touch or be involved with idols or any other thing of Satan (<a class=\"ref\">2 Cor. 6:15-18<\/a>). <\/p> <p><i>vessels.<\/i> This word refers to the sacred <i>vessels<\/i> of the temple (<a class=\"ref\">Ezra 1:7-11<\/a>), which could be borne only by those who held the priesthood. Thus the Lord here is commanding priesthood holders to be clean (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 38:41-42; 133:5<\/a>). The sacred vessels directly contrast with \"that which is unclean.\"<\/p> ",
