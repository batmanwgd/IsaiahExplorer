This point is expressed with colorful force in this section.<\/p>     <p>\u2003Isaiah 10:1\u20134, the immediately preceding stanza dealing with social injustice, began with the funeral cry, \u201cWoe!\u201d Verse 5 begins with the same word, but now it is directed toward the instrument God had used to punish Israel\u2019s and Judah\u2019s sins: the nation of Assyria. This is God\u2019s way of showing two things. (1) The promised destruction by Assyria is temporary and not permanent. God is not going to wipe out his people, letting Assyria run roughshod over them. (2) Assyria is not operating on its own. It may think so, but it is not. However great the Assyrian power, it operates only under God\u2019s sufferance. It only serves God\u2019s purposes. Once those purposes have been served, Assyria will be subject to the same moral scrutiny as any other nation. Just because that nation has been God\u2019s tool does not mean its people can live without any accountability to their Creator. In fact, they deny such accountability, insisting that they are the product of their own hands. Thus, they are one more expression of the creaturely pride that has such deadly effect on God\u2019s creatures (see 2:6\u20134:1; 13\u201314).<\/p>     ",
