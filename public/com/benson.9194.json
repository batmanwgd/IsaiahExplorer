Silence is a mark of grief and consternation: see <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NjA1XQ==\">Isaiah 47:5 <\/a>; <a href=\"\/\/www.studylight.org\/desk\/index.cgi?q1=Lamentations+11:10&t1=en_nas\" id=\"6\" class=\"stL\" target=\"_blank\">,Lamentations 11:10 <\/a>. The prophet here addresses the people of Tyre now fled to the island. The title of island, however, is often given by the Hebrews to places not surrounded by the sea, but only bordering upon it; <i>whom the merchants of Zidon have replenished <\/i>\u2014With mariners and commodities. Tyre and Sidon, being cities near each other, and both famous for merchandise and navigation, helped to enrich each other. <i>And by great waters the seed of Sihor, <\/i>,&c.\u2014Sihor here means the river Nile, so called, as it is also <a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 2:18 <\/a>,, and <a class=\"ref\">1 Chronicles 13:5 <\/a>,, from the blackness of its waters charged with the mud, which it brings down from Ethiopia, when it overflows; as it was called by the Greeks <i>Melas, <\/i>,and by the Latins <i>Melo, <\/i>,for the same reason. \u201cThe English translation,\u201d says Lowth, \u201cpublished under Queen Elizabeth, gives us a clearer sense of this verse thus: <i>The seed of Nilus, <\/i>,growing by <i>the abundance of waters, <\/i>,and <i>the harvest of the river was her revenues.\u201d <\/i>,Egypt, by its extraordinary fertility, caused by the overflowing of the Nile, supplied the neighbouring nations with corn, by which branch of trade the Tyrians gained great wealth. <\/p>,",
