Did not the Lord? <\/i>\u2014Do not flatter yourselves with a conceit of impunity, because you are a people whom God hath favoured with many and great privileges; for as God hath punished you formerly, be assured, if you continue to sin, he will punish you more and more. \u201cIt was reasonably to be expected that the Jews, blessed with such great privileges, would have been greatly honoured and respected; but, abusing those privileges, their case and situation have been, in various periods, what the prophet describes in these verses; broken, plundered, spoiled, despised by other nations, subject to the insolence of conquerors, shut up in prison, trod upon, abused and punished in such a manner as may justly raise the greatest commiseration. Their history, since the crucifixion of the Redeemer, supplies us with one continued detail of their miseries and afflictions; yet, which is most astonishing, <i>who among them giveth ear? who heareth for the time to come? <\/i>\u2014Who among them considereth the cause of their sufferings, and becometh <i>obedient to the law of Christ? <\/i> \u201d\u2014Dodd. <\/p> ",
