Truly, the phrase \"follow the prophet\" is a rallying cry for the righteous and their way of safety. (The \"ensign <i>to<\/i>[or for] the nations\" is discussed in the commentary in verse 12, as well as in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NjU5XQ==\">Isaiah 49:22<\/a> and <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzY2XQ==\">Isaiah 5:26<\/a>.)<\/p>",
