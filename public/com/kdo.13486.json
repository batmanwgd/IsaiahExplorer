Blessed is the mortal that doeth this, and the son of man that layeth fast hold thereon; who keepeth the Sabbath, that he doth not desecrate it, and keepeth his hand from doing any kind of evil.\u201d<\/i>, Jehovah and Israel have both an objective standard in the covenant relation into which they have entered: <span class=\"normal hebrew\">,\u05de\u05e9\u05c1\ufb44\u05d8<\/span>, (right) is practice answering to this; <span class=\"normal hebrew\">,\u05d9\u05e9\u05c1\ufb35\u05e2\u05d4<\/span>, (salvation) the performance promised by God; <span class=\"normal hebrew\">,\u05e6\u05d3\u05e7\u05d4<\/span>, (righteousness) on both sides such personal activity as is in accordance with the covenant relation, or what is the same thing, with the purpose and plan of salvation. The nearer the full realization on the part of Jehovah of what He has promised, the more faithful ought Israel to be in everything to which it is bound by its relation to Jehovah. <span class=\"normal hebrew\">,\u05d6\u05d0\u05ea<\/span>, (this) points, as in <a class=\"ref\">Psalm 7:4<\/a>, to what follows; and so also does <span class=\"normal hebrew\">,\ufb31\ufb34<\/span>, which points back to <span class=\"normal hebrew\">,\u05d6\u05d0\u05ea<\/span>,. Instead of <span class=\"normal hebrew\">,\u05e9\u05c1\u05de\u05d5\u05e8<\/span>, or <span class=\"normal hebrew\">,\u05dc\u05e9\u05c1\u05de\u05e8<\/span>, we have here <span class=\"normal hebrew\">,\u05e9\u05c1\u05de\u05e8<\/span>, the <span class=\"normal hebrew\">,\u05d6\u05d0\u05ea<\/span>, being described personally instead of objectively. <span class=\"normal hebrew\">,\ufb49\u05c1\ufb31\u05ea<\/span>, is used as a masculine in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzU2LDE4NzYwXQ==\">Isaiah 56:2, Isaiah 56:6<\/a>, (cf., <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODAwXQ==\">Isaiah 58:13<\/a>), although the word is not formed after the same manner as <span class=\"normal hebrew\">,\u05e7\ufb38\u05dc<\/span>, but is rather contracted from <span class=\"normal hebrew\">,\u05e9\u05c1\ufb31\u05ea\u05ea<\/span>, (a festive time, possibly with <span class=\"normal hebrew\">,\u05e2\u05ea<\/span>,= <span class=\"normal hebrew\">,\u05e2\u05d3\u05ea<\/span>, understood), and therefore was originally a feminine; and it is so personified in the language employed in the worship of the synagogue. <\/p>\n\n\n\n <p>(Note: According to <i>b. Sabbath<\/i>,119 <i>a<\/i>, R. Chanina dressed himself on Friday evening in his sabbath-clothes, and said, \u201cCome, and let us go to meet Queen Sabbath.\u201d And so did also Jannai, saying, \u201cCome, O bride; come, O bride.\u201d Hence the customary song with which the Sabbath was greeted had <span class=\"normal hebrew\">,\u05e0\u05e7\ufb31\u05dc\u05d4 <\/span> <span class=\"normal hebrew\">,\u05e9\u05c1\ufb31\u05ea <\/span> <span class=\"normal hebrew\">,\ufb44\u05e0\u05d9 <\/span> <span class=\"normal hebrew\">,\ufb3b\ufb3c\u05d4 <\/span> <span class=\"normal hebrew\">,\u05dc\u05e7\u05e8\u05d0\u05ea <\/span> <span class=\"normal hebrew\">,\u05d3\u05d5\u05d3\u05d9 <\/span> <span class=\"normal hebrew\">,\u05dc\u05db\u05d4<\/span>, as it commencement and refrain.) <br> <\/p>",
