Isaiah prophesies to the king of Judah (Ahaz) that the alliance will fail and offers to give Ahaz a sign. Ahaz refuses, but Isaiah gives the sign anyway, that a virgin will conceive and bring forth a son called Immanuel, but before the child reaches the age of accountability, the alliance of Syria and Israel will be broken (a dual prophecy of a later Immanuel). If Ahaz refuses to believe the Lord, Judah will be invaded by the Assyrians and the Egyptians, people will be captured and humiliated, leaving productive farmland to become pasture for hunting and grazing.  <\/p>  <h4>Dividing the Tree of 2 Nephi 17 into Branches<\/h4>  <ul>  <li>  1\u20132: The kingdoms of Syria and Israel threaten war against the kingdom of Judah  <\/li>  <li>  3\u20139: Isaiah prophesies that the Syria-Israel coalition will fail  <\/li>  <li>  10\u201316: Isaiah prophesies of Immanuel <\/li>  <li>  17\u201325: Isaiah prophesies against the kingdom of Judah if she doesn't listen  <\/li>  <\/ul>    ",
