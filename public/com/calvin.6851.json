    "html": "<p><i> The proof of their countenance will answer in them,<\/i> or,<i> will answer against them<\/i> As the Prophet had to do with impudent and brazen-faced hypocrites, who impudently boasted that they were good men; so he says that their countenance testifies what kind of persons they are, and that it will not be necessary to bring witnesses from a distance, in order to prove their wickedness; for<i> to answer<\/i> means \u201cto bear testimony,\u201d or \u201cto confess.\u201d Although, therefore, they disguise their face and countenance, so that they frequently deceive others, yet God compels them to show and prove what they are; so that, in spite of themselves they carry, as it were, in their forehead a mark of their deceit and hypocrisy.<\/p> \n<p>Some explain it, that their crimes are so manifest that they cannot avoid seeing, as in a mirror, the baseness which they desire to conceal But the former meaning is confirmed by what immediately follows, that they<i> declared their sin in the same manner as the inhabitants of Sodom<\/i> . By these words he intimates that they devoted themselves to iniquity in such a manner, that they boasted of their transgressions without any shame; as if it had been honorable and praiseworthy in them to trample on every distinction between right and wrong, and not to indulge in every kind of wickedness. On this account he compares them to the inhabitants of<i> Sodom<\/i> , (<a class=\"ref\">Genesis 18:20<\/a> ,) who were so much blinded by their lusts, that they rushed, with brutish stupidity, to everything base. So, then, this is<i> the answer of the countenance<\/i> , which he mentioned a little before, that they carry about with them plain tokens of impiety, which are abundantly sufficient to prove their guilt.<\/p> \n<p><i> Woe unto their soul!<\/i> Here he declares what was formerly mentioned, that the whole cause of their calamities is to be found in themselves; for by their sins and iniquities they provoked the Lord; and consequently that they have no means of evasion, that it is useless to contrive idle pretenses, because the evil itself dwells in their bones; as if he had said, \u201cGod cannot be accused, as if he punished you unjustly. Acknowledge that it has been done by yourselves; give glory to a righteous judge and lay the whole blame on yourselves.\u201d<\/p> ",
