The scholars of the world have no understanding of the Old Testament prophet's reference to the words of a sealed book that are delivered to both the learned and the unlearned. The added verses in the Book of Mormon reveal that the book will come from \"them which have slumbered\" (meaning the destroyed civilizations of the Nephites and the Jaredites). (<a class=\"ref\">2 Nephi 27:6<\/a>.)<\/p>     <p>It will contain revelations that tell of events \"from the beginning of the world to the ending thereof,\" but this information will be sealed up, yet to come forth in \"the own due time of the Lord.\" (<a class=\"ref\">2 Nephi 27:7-11<\/a>.)<\/p>     <p>The portion of the book which has not been sealed will be made available to the world, and \"three witnesses shall behold it, by the power of God, \u2026 and they shall testify to the truth of the book.\" (<a class=\"ref\">2 Nephi 27:12<\/a>.) In 1829, Oliver Cowdery, David Whitmer, and Martin Harris were called of God to be these witnesses. They bore testimony to the world of having seen the plates from which the Book of Mormon was translated, of seeing the heavenly messenger Moroni, and of hearing the voice of God bear record that the plates had been translated \"by the gift and power of God.\"<\/p>     <p>The added text of Nephi also tells that, in addition to the translator of the record (Joseph Smith) and the Three Witnesses, \"a few according to the will of God\" will also be called \"to bear testimony.\" (<a class=\"ref\">2 Nephi 27:13<\/a>.) These few are known as the Eight Witnesses, who were divinely authorized to see and handle the plates under the direction of theProphet Joseph. Those who bore testimony of their participation on this momentous occasion were Christian Whitmer; Jacob Whitmer; Peter Whitmer, Jr.; John Whitmer; Hiram Page; Joseph Smith, Sr.; Hyrum Smith; and Samuel H. Smith. Their testimony, as that of the Three Witnesses, can be found in the forepart of the Book of Mormon. (See also HC 1:58, note.)<\/p>     <p>In addition to the twelve formal witnesses listed above (including Joseph Smith), the truthfulness of the book will be testified \"in the mouth of as many witnesses as seemeth [the Lord] good.\" (<a class=\"ref\">2 Nephi 27:14<\/a>; see also <a class=\"ref\">2 Nephi 11:3<\/a>.) This prophecy has been fulfilled by the millions who have borne testimony of its truthfulness from the days it was first published until the present time; and millions, if not billions, will continue to add their testimony of it in the future.<\/p>     <p>The Nephite text also adds this warning: \"And wo be unto him that rejecteth the word of God!\" (<a class=\"ref\">2 Nephi 27:14<\/a>.) Such rejection occurs not only when the book is spurned by unbelievers but also when Latter-day Saints those who have accepted the book as the word of God fail to take it seriously. Regarding such neglect, consider the warnings of two latter-day prophets.<\/p>     <p>President Joseph Fielding Smith, tenth prophet of the Lord in these latter days, stated: \"No member of [The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints] can stand approved in the presence of God who has not seriously and carefully read the Book of Mormon.\" (CR, October 1961, p. 18.)<\/p>     <p>President Ezra Taft Benson, the thirteenth man to wear the prophet's mantle in this dispensation, declared: \"Every Latter-day Saint should make the study of this book a lifetime pursuit. Otherwise he is placing his soul in jeopardy and neglecting that which could give spiritual and intellectual unity to his whole life.\" (CR, April 1975, p. 97.)<\/p>     <table>         <tbody>             <tr>                 <td>11 <u>And the vision of all is become unto you as the words of a book that is sealed, which men deliver to one that is<\/u> learned, saying<u>,<\/u> Read this, I pray thee<u>:<\/u>                     <br>                     <br>. . . <u>a<\/u>nd <u>he<\/u><i> saith<\/i><u>,<\/u> I cannot<u>;<\/u> for it is sealed<u>:<\/u>                     <br>                     <br>12 <u>And the book is<\/u> deliver<u>ed<\/u> to him that is not learned<u>,saying, Read this, I pray thee:<\/u> and <u>he<\/u><i> saith,<\/i> I am not learned.                     <br>                 <\/td>                 <td>6 <u>And it shall come to pass that the Lord God shall bring forth unto you the words of a book, and they shall be the words of them which have slumbered.<\/u>                     <br>                     <br>7 <u>And behold the book shall be sealed; and in the book shall be a revelation from God, from the beginning of the world to the ending thereof.<\/u>                     <br>                     <br>8 <u>Wherefore, because of the things which are sealed up, the things which are sealed shall not be delivered in the day of the wickedness and abominations of the people.
