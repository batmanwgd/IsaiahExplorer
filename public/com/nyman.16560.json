The persecution of the Latter-day Saints, particularly in the days of Joseph Smith, is very similar to the events in these verses. The passage may also describe the persecution of the Savior as he was condemned. According to tradition, Isaiah also faced persecutors, eventually being sawn asunder with a wooden saw.<\/p>     ",
