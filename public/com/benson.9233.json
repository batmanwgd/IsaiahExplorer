The reader will observe, the song begun, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTMyXQ==\">Isaiah 26:1<\/a> , is continued, and Isaiah is foretelling what the language of the church would be after her deliverance. <i>By thee only<\/i>\u2014By thy favour and help, by which alone we have been rescued from the tyranny of our enemies, and not by our merits or strength;<i>will we make mention of thy name \u2014<\/i><\/p> \n<p>Celebrate thy praise, and trust in thee for the future. Bishop Lowth renders the clause, <i>Thee only, and thy name, henceforth will we celebrate. They are dead, &c., they shall not rise<\/i>\u2014Those tyrants are destroyed, they shall never live or rise again to molest us. He probably refers to the miraculous destruction of Sennacherib\u2019s army before Jerusalem, and to the overthrow of the Babylonian empire. <i>Therefore hast thou visited and destroyed them,<\/i> &c.\u2014That they might be thus effectually destroyed thou didst undertake the work; and thou hast perfectly accomplished it, and abolished the monuments or memorials of their greatness and glory. The prophet speaks of what he foresaw, with certainty, would be done, as though it were effected already.<\/p> ",
