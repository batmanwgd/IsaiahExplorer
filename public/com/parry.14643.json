    "html": " <p>This section features a detailed description of the \"day of the Lord,\" or the Second Coming, which is presented both in symbolic and in plain terms. The repetition found in the passage gives emphasis to specific aspects of the revelation. For example, Isaiah speaks three times concerning the \"fear of the Lord\" and the \"glory of his majesty\" (2:10, 19, 21); twice he says that \"the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day\" (2:11, 17). On two occasions Isaiah uses the phrase \"for fear of the Lord [shall come upon them], and the glory of his majesty [shall smite them]\" (2:10, 19); twice he notes that the idols of humanity will be destroyed (2:18, 20), and twice he mentions that the loftiness or haughtiness of man would be bowed down or made low (2:11, 17).<\/p> <p>This passage also clarifies the great contrast between the exaltation of God and the lowliness of mankind. When the day of the Lord shall come, the wicked will be \"humbled,\" \"bowed down,\" \"brought low,\" and \"made low.\" They will seek low areas of earth (a phrase that recalls hell, the grave, and the underworld), holes, caves, clefts, and rocks that are normally used by dark-seeking creatures like moles and bats. In contrast, the Lord is described as one who causes fear, possesses majesty, is exalted, and has great glory. The events that will accompany the Second Coming will be dreadful for the wicked and the proud and haughty; they will be brought down into the dust through the power, might, and glory of Jesus Christ, and God alone will be exalted.<\/p> <blockquote> [O ye wicked ones], <i>enter into the rock,<\/i> and <i>hide [ye] in the dust;<\/i>     <br>for the <u>fear of the Lord<\/u> and the <u>glory of his majesty<\/u> [shall smite thee]. (2:10)     <br>[And it shall come to pass that] the <i>lofty looks of man<\/i> shall be <u>humbled<\/u>,     <br>and the <i>haughtiness of men<\/i> shall be <u>bowed down<\/u>,     <br>and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day.
