Most threshing instruments work best on level ground, but this special threshing tool, because it is created by the Lord, is capable of threshing hills and mountains, a seemingly impossible task. That means that we, the house of Israel, are capable of performing impossible works through the power of God, who created us. Part of our goal, through harvesting the white fields (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 4<\/a>), is to seek out the honest in heart. Eventually the gathering will separate the righteous from the wicked, just as wheat is separated from the tares.<\/p> ",
