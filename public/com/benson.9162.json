In these verses the prophet describes \u201cthe immediate causes of these evils; 1st, The folly of the princes and rulers, who valued themselves upon their Wisdom , , 2 d, The cowardice and effeminacy of the people in general. Egypt would not have become a prey to so many foreign enemies, but through the excessive weakness of the Egyptians, both in counsel and in action. They had not the courage even to defend themselves. They trusted chiefly to their Grecian and other mercenaries, who, instead of defending, were often the first to betray them.\u201d\u2014Bishop Newton. <i>How say ye unto Pharaoh <\/i>\u2014Why do ye put such false and foolish words into Pharaoh\u2019s mouth? <i>I am the son of the wise <\/i>\u2014Wisdom is hereditary and natural to me. This vain opinion of himself they cherished by their flatteries. <i>The son of <\/i>,the <i>ancient kings \u2014 <\/i>,The prophet derides the vanity of the Egyptians, who used to boast of the antiquity of their nation, and especially of their kings, who, as they pretended, had reigned successively for 10,000 years. <i>Where are thy wise men? <\/i>\u2014Who pretended, that either by their deep policy, or by their skill in astrology, or magic, they could certainly foresee things to come. <i>The princes of Noph are deceived <\/i>\u2014Another chief city, and one of the king\u2019s seats, called also <i>Moph, <\/i>,in the Hebrew text, (<a class=\"ref\">Hosea 9:6 <\/a>,,) and by other and later writers, <i>Memphis. They that are the stay \u2014 <\/i>,Their chief counsellors; <i>of the tribes <\/i>\u2014Of the provinces, which he calls by a title borrowed from the Hebrews, in whose language he spake and wrote this prophecy. <i>The Lord hath mingled <\/i>\u2014Hath <i>poured out, <\/i>,or given them to drink, <i>a perverse spirit\u2014A spirit of error, <\/i>,or <i>delusion, <\/i>,as the LXX. and Chaldee render it. That is, he has suffered them, in punishment of their sins, to take foolish steps, and follow pernicious counsels. <i>They have caused Egypt to err in every work <\/i>\u2014In all their designs and undertakings. They have given such ill counsel, and pursued such wrong measures, that nothing has succeeded as it should. <i>Neither shall there be any work which the head or tail may do <\/i>\u2014The people shall generally want employment, or, as some explain it, all orders of men, from the highest to the lowest, shall fail in the discharge of their duty, or be unsuccessful in all they undertake. <\/p>,",
