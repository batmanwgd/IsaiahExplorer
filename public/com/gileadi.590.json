    "html": " <p>The heavens vanishing as by smoke, the earth&rsquo;s wearing out like a garment, and its inhabitants perishing like vermin (cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxNzc3MCwxNzk2MF0seyIxODEwMCI6M31d\">Isaiah 5:30; 14:31; 24:4-6 <\/a>) represent the earth&rsquo;s return to chaos that ends its present cycle before it regenerates to a paradisiacal state. Because salvation follows righteousness (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NTcwLDE4NjAwLDE4NzU1XQ==\">Isaiah 45:8; 46:13; 56:1 <\/a>), salvation&mdash;as typified by the earth&rsquo;s regeneration (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4Njc3XQ==\">v 3 <\/a>)&mdash;depends on its inhabitants attaining a state of righteousness. On these principles of <em>salvation <\/em> preceded by <em>righteousness <\/em>&mdash;exemplified by Jehovah and his servant&mdash;rests all that doesn&rsquo;t die (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgzMjIiOjd9LFsxODc5NSwxODc5OF0seyIxODgzOSI6Nn1d\">Isaiah 35:1-7; 58:8, 11; 60:17-22 <\/a>). <\/p> ",
