    "html": " <p> <em>Ye rulers of Sodom \"Ye princes of Sodom\"\u2014<\/em>, The incidental mention of Sodom and Gomorrah in the preceding verse suggested to the prophet this spirited address to the rulers and inhabitants of Jerusalem, under the character of princes of Sodom and people of Gomorrah. Two examples of a sort of elegant turn of the like kind may be observed in St. Paul's Epistle to the Romans, <a class=\"ref\">Romans 15:4, Romans 15:5, Romans 15:12, Romans 15:13<\/a>. See Locke on the place; and see <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3Njg0XQ==\">Isaiah 1:29<\/a>, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3Njg1XQ==\">Isaiah 1:30<\/a>, of this chapter, which gives another example of the same. <\/p>\n\n <p>And - like unto Gomorrah. - The <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d5<\/span>, vau is added by thirty-one of Kennicott's MSS., twenty-nine of De Rossi's and one, very ancient, of my own. See note on <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NjYxXQ==\">Isaiah 1:6<\/a>; (note). <\/p>",
