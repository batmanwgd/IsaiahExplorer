    "html": "<p> (2) The people that walked in darkness . . .\u2014The words throw us back upon<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzgyOSI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 8:21-22<\/a> . The prophet sees in his vision a light shining on the forlorn and weary wanderers. They had been wandering in the \u201cvalley of the shadow of death\u201d (the phrase comes from<a class=\"ref\">Psalms 23:4; Job 3:5<\/a>), almost as in the gloom of Sheol itself. Now there breaks in the dawn of a glorious day. Historically the return of some of the inhabitants of that region to their allegiance to Jehovah and the house of David (<a class=\"ref\">2 Chronicles 30:11; 2 Chronicles 30:13<\/a>) may have been the starting point of the prophet\u2019s hopes. The words have to the Christian student a special interest, as having been quoted by St. Matthew (<a class=\"ref\">Matthew 4:15-16<\/a>) in connection with our Lord\u2019s ministry in Galilee, perhaps with His being \u201cof Nazareth,\u201d which was in the tribe of Zebulun. We cannot positively say that such a fulfilment as that was in the prophet\u2019s thoughts. The context shows in that he was thinking of Assyrian invasions, and the defeat of Assyrian armies, of a nation growing strong in numbers and prosperity. In this, as in other cases, the Evangelist adapts the words of prophecy to a further meaning than that which apparently was in the mind of the writer, and interprets them by his own experience. When he compared the state of Galilee, yet more, perhaps, that of his own soul, before and after the Son of man had appeared as the light of the world, Isaiah\u2019s words seemed the only adequate expression of the change.<\/p> ",
