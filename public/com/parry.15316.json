    "html": " <i>Look upon Zion, the city of our solemnities. <\/i>Zion will be a city of solemnities, or, perhaps, solemn assemblies.<\/p> <p><i>Jerusalem a quiet habitation. <\/i>Jerusalem, a city that has witnessed many wars and much bloodshed, will be a peaceful city (see 32:17) when the Lord reigns as \"our king\" (33:22).<\/p> <p><i>a tabernacle&hellip;shall not be taken down. <\/i>This refers to the tabernacle of Moses, a portable temple that was a large tent with stakes and cords. The stakes were sticks or posts driven into the ground; cords or ropes connected the tabernacle to the stakes. Both the stakes and cords supported the tabernacle.<\/p> <p> The entire verse speaks about latter-day Zion and informs us that the temples of the Lord will be surrounded and upheld by the stakes of Zion, which are gathering places of the Lord's people. As the stakes and cords of a tent serve to uphold it during a storm, so the stakes of Zion are \"for a defense, and for a refuge from the storm, and from wrath when it shall be poured out without mixture upon the whole earth\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 115:6<\/a>). The phrase \"a tabernacle&hellip;shall not be taken down\" contrasts with Moses' portable tabernacle that had to be repeatedly put up and \"taken down\"\u2014Jerusalem at the Second Coming will be a permanent, everlasting place.<\/p> ",
