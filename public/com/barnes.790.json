Pride commonly evinces itself in a lofty carriage and supercilious aspect; <a class=\"ref\">Psalm 18:27<\/a>. <\/p> <p> <em>Shall be humbled <\/em>&mdash;By the calamities that shall sweep over the land. This does not mean that he shall be brought &ldquo;to be&rdquo; humble, or to have a humble heart, but that that on which he so much prided himself would be taken away. <\/p> <p> <em>The Lord alone... <\/em>&mdash;God will so deal with them as to vindicate his honor; to turn the attention entirely on himself, and to secure the reverence of all the people. So terrible shall be his judgments, and so &ldquo;manifestly&rdquo; shall they come from &ldquo;him,&rdquo; that they shall look away from everything else to &ldquo;him&rdquo; alone. <\/p> <p> <em>In that day <\/em>&mdash;In the day of which the prophet speaks, when God would punish them for their sins, Reference is probably made to the captivity at Babylon. It may be remarked, that one design of punishment is to lead people to regard and honor God. He will humble the pride of people, and so pass before them in his judgments, that they shall be compelled to &ldquo;acknowledge&rdquo; him as their just Sovereign and Judge. <\/p> ",
