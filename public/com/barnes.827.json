    "html": "<p><i>And her gates<\/i> \u2014Cities were surrounded with walls, and were entered through gates opening into the principal streets. Those gates became, of course, the places of chief confluence and of business; and the expression here means, that in all the places of confluence, or amidst the assembled people, there should be lamentation on account of the slain in battle, and the loss of their mighty men in war.<\/p><p><i>And she<\/i> \u2014Jerusalem is often represented as a female distinguished for beauty. It is here represented as a female sitting in a posture of grief. <p><i>Being desolate, shall sit upon the ground<\/i> \u2014To sit on the ground, or in the dust, was the usual posture of grief and mourning, denoting great depression and humiliation; <a class='ref'> Lamentations 2:10; Lamentations 3:28; Jeremiah 15:17; Job 3:13; Ezra 9:3-5<\/a>. It is a remarkable coincidence, that in the medals which were made by the Romans to commemorate the captivity of Judea and Jerusalem, Judea is represented under the figure of a female sitting in a posture of grief, under a palm tree, with this inscription\u2014judea capta. The passage here, however, refers not to the captivity by the Romans, but to the first destruction by Nebuchadnezzar. It is a tender and most affecting image of desolation. During the captivity at Babylon, it was completely fulfilled; and for ages since, Judea might be appropriately represented by a captive female sitting pensively on the ground. <p><\/div> ",
