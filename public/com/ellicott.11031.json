    "html": "<p> (10) Hast not been mindful of the rock of thy strength.\u2014Jehovah, as the true defence, the fortress rock of His people ( <a class=\"ref\">Deuteronomy 32:4<\/a>), is contrasted with the rock-fortresses in which the people had put their trust. They had forsaken the One, and therefore, by a just retribution, the others should be forsaken.<\/p> \n<p>Therefore shalt thou plant pleasant plants.\u2014Better, thou didst plant. The word for \u201cpleasant\u201d is found here only as a common noun. The singular appears as a proper name in <a class=\"ref\">Genesis 46:21, Numbers 26:40<\/a> , and in the more familiar instance of Naaman the Syrian ( <a class=\"ref\">2 Kings 5:1<\/a>). It would appear that the prophet chose the peculiar term to indicate the foreign, in this case the Syrian, character of the worship to which he refers as the \u201cplant\u201d which Israel had adopted. Mr. Cheyne, following an ingenious suggestion of Lagarde\u2019s, connects it (1) with the Arabic Nahr No\u2019man, the name of the river Belus near Acre, and (2) with the Arabic name (Shakaiku-\u2019n-nom\u00e2n) for the red anemone. The former was near the head-quarters of the worship of Thammuz, the Ph\u0153nician Adonis, and the flower was sacred to him, and so it is inferred that the prophet refers to \u201cthe gardens of Adonis,\u201d fair but perishable (Plato, Ph\u0153dr. p. 276 B), in which Israel had delighted ( <a class=\"ref\">Ezekiel 8:14<\/a>). The addition of \u201cstrange slips,\u201d literally, vine-slips of a strange one\u2014i.e., of a strange god (comp. <a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 2:21<\/a>)\u2014confirms at least the general drift of this interpretation.<\/p> ",
