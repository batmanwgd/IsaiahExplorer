    "html": "<p>A protracted satire against idolaters, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NTU0XQ==\">verses 9-20<\/a> poke fun at idol makers and worshipers of false gods. Transposed into modern times&mdash;but equally relevant to Judah&rsquo;s ancient Babylonian exile&mdash;the worldly objects people covet, get fixated on, spend their energies and resources on, by their very nature displace Jehovah in their lives and thus deprive them of his covenant blessings. When Babylon&rsquo;s socio-economic system that is based on the production, promotion, and sale of the works of men&rsquo;s hands collapses in Jehovah&rsquo;s Day of Judgment, the material &ldquo;things&rdquo; people have left can&rsquo;t help them.<\/p><p>If idolaters actually got a sense of Jehovah&rsquo;s reality&mdash;&ldquo;Were they all to assemble and take their stand [before me]&rdquo;&mdash;they would at once realize their folly and &ldquo;cringe in fear&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NTQ1XQ==\">v 11<\/a>). But when Jehovah&rsquo;s people become so infatuated with the allures of the Harlot Babylon that nothing else interests them, they are ripe for destruction: &ldquo;By your skill and science you were led astray, thinking to yourself, I exist, and there is none besides me! Catastrophe shall overtake you, which you shall not know how to avert by bribes; disaster shall befall you from which you cannot ransom yourself&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 47:10-11<\/a>).<\/p>",
