    "html": "<p>The servant&rsquo;s function as <em>nail<\/em> expresses his role as a proxy savior under the terms of the Davidic Covenant. The burden that &ldquo;hangs&rdquo; or &ldquo;depends&rdquo; (<em>talu<\/em>) on him consists of the children of <em>his<\/em> &ldquo;father&rdquo;&mdash;his Savior&mdash;who are identified as &ldquo;vessels&rdquo; great and small, a term that serves as a metaphor for Jehovah&rsquo;s people (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzA4LDE4OTQzXQ==\">Isaiah 52:11; 66:20<\/a>). The imagery of a <em>nail<\/em> &ldquo;in a sure place&rdquo; signifies the burden of suffering a proxy savior endures in answering for his people&rsquo;s disloyalties to Jehovah, as when the servant obtains Jehovah&rsquo;s people&rsquo;s temporal salvation or deliverance from a mortal threat (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzExLDE4NzIzXQ==\">Isaiah 52:14; 53:11<\/a>).<\/p>",
