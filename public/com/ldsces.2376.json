    "html": "<p>John saw a vision similar to Isaiah&rsquo;s and spoke of this righteous man as an &ldquo;angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the living God&rdquo; (<a class=\"ref\">Revelation 7:2<\/a>). The Lord revealed to Joseph Smith that this angel of the east was &ldquo;Elias which was to come to gather together the tribes of Israel and restore all things&rdquo; (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 77:9<\/a>).<\/p><p>Of this &ldquo;angel,&rdquo; Elder Bruce R. McConkie said: &ldquo;Who has restored all things? Was it one man? Certainly not. Many angelic ministrants have been sent from the courts of glory to confer keys and powers, to commit their dispensations and glories again to men on earth. At least the following have come: Moroni, John the Baptist, Peter, James and John, Moses, Elijah, Elias, Gabriel, Raphael, and Michael. (<a class=\"ref\">D. &amp; C. 13; 110; 128:19&ndash;21<\/a> .) Since it is apparent that no one messenger has carried the whole burden of the restoration, but rather that each has come with a specific endowment from on high, it becomes clear that<em>Elias is a composite personage. The expression must be understood to be a name and a title for those whose mission it was to commit keys and powers to men in this final dispensation.<\/em> (<em>Doctrines of Salvation,<\/em> vol. 1, pp. 170&ndash;174.)&rdquo; (<em>Mormon Doctrine,<\/em> p. 221.)<\/p><p>Thus the &ldquo;man from the east&rdquo; seems to mean angels of the Restoration, who are grouped together under the composite title of Elias.<\/p><p class=\"cite\"> LDS Church Educational System Old Testament Student Manual, 1 Kings&ndash;Malachi, Religion 302, Chapter 16, Item 15<\/p> ",
