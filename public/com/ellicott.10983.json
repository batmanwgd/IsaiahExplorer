(See <a class=\"ref\">Genesis 14:18; Daniel 4:24; Luke 8:28; Acts 16:17 <\/a>.) The Persians carried their adulation still further, and applied the title \u201cgod\u201d to their kings (\u00c6sch. Pers. 623), as the Syrians afterwards did in the case of Antiochus Theos. The Assyrian and Babylonian inscriptions, for the most part, fall short of this, and describe the king as the \u201cservant,\u201d or \u201cpriest,\u201d of Assur, or Bel, or Nebo, \u201cthe viceroy, or vicar, of the gods.\u201d <\/p> ",
