    "html": " <p> <em>He will swallow up death\u2014 <\/em> He, by the grace of God, will taste death for every man. <a class=\"ref\">Hebrews 2:9 <\/a>. Probably, swallow up death, and taste death, in both these verses, refer to the same thing: Jesus dying instead of a guilty world. These forms of speech may refer to the punishment of certain criminals; they were obliged to drink a cup of poison. That cup which every criminal in the world must have drunk, Jesus Christ drank for them; and thus he swallowed up death: but as he rose again from the dead, complete victory was gained. <\/p> \n\n <p>From these three verses we learn: - <\/p> <ol> I. That the Gospel is a plenteous provision: \"I will make a feast for all people.\"\n\n <\/ol> II. That it is a source of light and salvation: \"I will destroy the veil. I will abolish death. and bring life and immortality to light.\" <ol> III. That it is a source of comfort and happiness: \"I will wipe away all tears from off all faces.\"\n\n <\/ol> As in the Arabic countries a covering was put over the face of him who was condemned to suffer death, it is probable that the words in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTI2XQ==\">Isaiah 25:7 <\/a>; may refer to this. The whole world was condemned to death, and about to be led out to execution, when the gracious Lord interposed, and, by a glorious sacrifice, procured a general pardon.",
