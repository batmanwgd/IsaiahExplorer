    "html": "<p><b>(<a class=\"ref\">2 Nephi 18:19<\/a>).<\/b>\"<i>Should not a people seek unto their God for the living to <u>hear from<\/u> the dead?<\/i>\" The Book of Mormon text significantly clarifies this verse. This clarification is not an invitation for one to seek contact with the dead. It seems this is Isaiah's way of saying we must avoid seances and other such nonsense. Fortune tellers, wizards, sorcerers, soothsayers, and others who claim to conjure up contact with the spirit world should be avoided like the plague. There is no doubt they can make contact with the evil spirits in Satan's world, and those who play with this fire will get spiritually burned. God is the God over the living and the dead, and He does not grant foolish requests.<\/p>",
