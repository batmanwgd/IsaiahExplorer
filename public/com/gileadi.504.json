Nevertheless, as their Savior he takes their transgressions on himself in order to redeem them: &ldquo;He was pierced for our transgressions, crushed because of our iniquities; the price of our peace he incurred, and with his wounds we are healed&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzE3XQ==\">Isaiah 53:5<\/a>; cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODg3NSI6Mn0=\">63:8-9<\/a>). The expression &ldquo;for my own sake&rdquo; defines Jehovah&rsquo;s role as a proxy savior under the terms of the Davidic Covenant. If his people will but repent, he will &ldquo;blot out&rdquo; their offenses and heal them (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzgwLDE4NTU2XQ==\">Isaiah 6:10; 44:22<\/a>).<\/p>",
