The word &lsquo;instruments&rsquo; here denotes evidently the means by which the churl accomplishes his object; whether it be by words, by judicial decisions, or by crafty devices. This is also a kind of proverbial expression, and is given as a further reason why such a person would not be employed by a wise and virtuous prince.<\/p><p><em>Are evil<\/em>&mdash;He will make use of any unprincipled means, any wicked plan or device, to accomplish his purpose. &ldquo;With lying words.&rdquo; With false representations; or with deceitful promises and assurances. His aim would be particularly directed to the poor and humble, as more easily deprived of their rights than the rich and powerful. It was also of greater importance to defend the rights of the poor, and therefore the prophet says that such a person should not be in the employ of a just and virtuous ruler.<\/p><p><em>Even when the needy speaketh right<\/em>&mdash;That is, although the cause of the needy is one of truth and equity. When this would be manifest, the unprincipled man in power would deprive him of his rights, and, therefore, under a wise and virtuous administration, such a person should not be employed.<\/p> ",
