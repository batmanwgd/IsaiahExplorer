The pillars of &ldquo;smoke&rdquo; form a word link to the &ldquo;mushrooming clouds of smoke&rdquo; that billow upward when &ldquo;the earth is scorched and people are but fuel for the fire&rdquo; in Jehovah&rsquo;s Day of Judgment (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzg0OCI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 9:18-19<\/a>). While the wicked of the world suffer the fire and smoke of destruction, Jehovah protects his repentant people beneath his cloud of glory (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc3MzkiOjJ9LHsiMTgxMjMiOjJ9XQ==\">Isaiah 4:5-6; 25:4-5<\/a>).<\/p> ",
