These leaders are praised as those who can somehow achieve superhuman things. Inevitably they fail, for too much is being asked of them. In language reminiscent of chapter 3, God says that he will deprive Israel and Judah of all such false leaders. The same phrase \u201chead and tail\u2026palm branch and reed\u201d occurs in 19:15, where it refers to the leadership of Egypt. This may have been a proverbial way of speaking of totality, something like \u201cfront to back, top to bottom.\u201d<\/p>     <p>\u2003It does not matter who these leaders are, whether they are social, political, or spiritual (9:15); they will all be swept away. As a result of their leadership the land has become so corrupt that no one, neither the strongest (\u201cthe young men\u201d) nor the weakest (\u201cthe fatherless and widows\u201d), will be in a position to claim any special favors from God.<\/p>     ",
