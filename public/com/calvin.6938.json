Some commentators, I am aware, are of opinion that it was a different person; but a careful examination of the circumstances will convince any one, that this was the same <i>Urijah<\/i>, of whom the sacred history declares that he was slavishly devoted to the ungodliness and lawless desires of the king. (<a class=\"ref\">2 Kings 16:11<\/a>.) As to those who think that it was a different person, because Isaiah here calls this man <i>faithful<\/i>, such an argument carries little weight; for the Prophet did not look at the man, but at the office which he held, and which rendered him a fit person for bearing testimony. Accordingly, he does not mean that he was a good and excellent man, but that his office gave him such influence that nobody could reject him, and that his testimony was, as they say, free from every objection. <\/p>\n <p> <i>Uriah the priest, and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah.<\/i>, I think that this prophecy was affixed to the gates of the temple, <i>Uriah and Zechariah<\/i>, having been <i>taken<\/i>, to be <i>witnesses<\/i>,; for he does not speak of a vision, but of a command of God, which he actually obeyed, in order that these words, like a common proverb, might be repeated by every person. <\/p>",
