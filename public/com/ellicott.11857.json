The LXX., Josephus, and Strabo render it by the plain, or the woodland. (Comp. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4Mjg5XQ==\">Isaiah 33:9<\/a>; <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MzIzXQ==\">Isaiah 35:2<\/a>.) <\/p> \n <p>The valley of Achor.\u2014The name, traditionally connected with the sin of Achan (<a class=\"ref\">Joshua 7:24-26<\/a>), belonged to a valley running into the plain of Jericho, and is here taken as the Eastern limit of the region bounded by the Sharon on the west. The whole district was to be as a \u201cgarden of the Lord\u201d for the restored remnant. (Comp. the striking parallelism of <a class=\"ref\">Hosea 2:15<\/a>.) <\/p> ",
