He saith,<i> he made his grave,<\/i> because this was Christ\u2019s own act, and he willingly yielded up himself to death and burial. And that which follows,<i> with the wicked,<\/i> does not denote the sameness of place, as if he should be buried in the same grave with other malefactors, but the sameness of condition. But the words may be rendered,<i> A grave was appointed for him with the wicked; but he was with the rich at his death.<\/i> Or, as Bishop Lowth reads it,<i> His grave was appointed with the wicked; but with the rich man was his tomb.<\/i> See his notes. \u201cAs our Lord was crucified between two thieves, it was doubtless intended he should be buried with them. \u2018Thus his grave was appointed with the wicked;\u2019 but Joseph of Arimathea came and asked for his body, and Pilate, convinced that he had committed no crime, readily granted Joseph\u2019s request. Thus \u2018he was with the rich at his death,\u2019 that is, till his resurrection: and this took place contrary to the intention of his enemies,<i> because he had done no violence,<\/i> &c., for otherwise Joseph would scarcely have requested Pilate, and probably Pilate would not have consented, to deliver up the body of a crucified malefactor.\u201d \u2014 Scott. But this latter clause may be connected with the following verse, and rendered,<i> Although he had done no violence,<\/i> &c<i> ., yet it pleased the Lord,<\/i> &c. In this light it is considered by Bishop Lowth and many others.<\/p> ",
