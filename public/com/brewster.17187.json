When that priesthood is exercised in righteousness, Zion puts on or displays \"her beautiful garments.\" (See DCE, 40.) This verse may also be a reference to sacred garments that are provided in holy places; perhaps when we put on our \"beautiful garments\" we remember sacred covenants and the need to keep ourselves worthy to enter into the presence of God.<\/p>",
