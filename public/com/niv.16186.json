Verses 1\u20134 spoke of the political leaders and the nobility, whereas verses 7\u20138 show that the priests and prophets are no better off. They too are besotted with the attempt to please and satisfy themselves. Undoubtedly, alcohol abuse is a problem for them, but it is only a symptom of their deeper problem, an unwillingness to surrender their needs and desires to the Lord (cf. also Mal. 2:1\u20139).<\/p>     <p>\u2003The result is that those who should be giving clear guidance and teaching in that desperate hour are \u201cbefuddled\u201d and staggering around in a stupor. The \u201ctables\u201d (28:8) may be tables at which the priests sit to give judgment, or they may be the mats around which the partygoers sit. In any case, Isaiah says they \u201care covered with vomit,\u201d expressing the depths of his disgust with what is taking place.<\/p>     <p>\u2003Verses 9\u201310 express the mockery of these religious leaders for the true prophet. \u201cWho does he think he is,\u201d they say, \u201ctreating us like little children?\u201d Of course, childishness is just what alcohol does to a person, but it makes them unable to recognize the fact. They denounce the repetitive simplicity of the prophet\u2019s teaching, clearly wanting something more nuanced and ambiguous as befits their supposedly sophisticated understanding.<\/p>     <p>\u2003The prophet responds in 28:11\u201313 by saying that since this is what they think they are getting, it is exactly what they <em>will<\/em> get, only from other lips than his. Since they refuse God\u2019s invitation to rest in him by abandoning their petty pride and demeaning pleasures, they will learn his truth through \u201cforeign lips and strange tongues.\u201d In other words, the Assyrians will teach them that what the prophet said is true. Then the demands of the conquerors will <em>really<\/em> be repetitively simple. If the people will not learn the easy way of faith, then they must learn the hard way of experience: \u201cThey will go and fall backward\u201d (28:13).<\/p>     ",
