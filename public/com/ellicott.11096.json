This was probably identical with the \u201cpool of Hezekiah,\u201d known also as the Birket-el-Batrak (\u201cpool of the patriarchs\u201d), between two walls, that to the north of Zaon, and that which runs to the north-east round the Acra. During the rainy season this is supplied by the small conduit which runs from the upper pool along the surface of the ground, and then under the wall near the Joppa gate (Robinson, Researches, i., 437-439). The \u201cold pool\u201d was probably the pool of Siloam (<a class=\"ref\">John 9:7 <\/a>), or the king\u2019s pool (<a class=\"ref\">Nehemiah 2:14 <\/a>). <\/p> \n <p>Ye have not looked unto the maker thereof.\u2014These material defences, the prophet affirms, will avail but little if they forget Him who was the true \u201cbuilder and maker\u201d of the city, and who alone can secure its safety. <\/p> ",
