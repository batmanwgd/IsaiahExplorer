    "html": "<p>While the Book of Mormon can accurately be described as a marvelous work and a wonder, Isaiah&rsquo;s prophecy includes more than the book. Elder LeGrand Richards exclaimed:<\/p><p>&ldquo;What would really constitute a marvelous work and a wonder? Why should not honest lovers of truth welcome the pronouncement of such a work? Should any generation reject revealed truth when sent from heaven, even as they rejected the Christ when he came among men? Why does it seem so much easier to accept and believe in the dead prophets than in living prophets?<\/p><p>&ldquo;In the accomplishment of this promised marvelous work and a wonder, the Lord had in mind a &lsquo;restitution of all things&rsquo; and moved upon Peter to so prophesy to those who had crucified his Lord: [<a class=\"ref\">Acts 3:19&ndash;21<\/a> ].&rdquo; (<em>A Marvelous Work and a Wonder,<\/em> pp. 34&ndash;35.)<\/p><p>Thus the entire restoration of the priesthood&mdash;the Church, the ordinances, the gospel truths&mdash;constitute the marvelous work and a wonder that Isaiah foretold.<\/p><p class=\"cite\"> LDS Church Educational System Old Testament Student Manual, 1 Kings&ndash;Malachi, Religion 302, Chapter 15, Item 18<\/p> ",
