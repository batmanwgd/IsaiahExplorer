When they keep the terms of his covenant, Jehovah defends them against all who attack them. Even as the enemy encroaches upon them, however, his unrepentant people fail to turn to him: &ldquo;Have you forgotten Jehovah, your Maker, who suspends the heavens, who sets the earth in place, that you go all day in constant dread of the oppressor&rsquo;s rage as he readies himself to wreak destruction?&rdquo; ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4Njg3XQ==\">Isaiah 51:13<\/a>).<\/p> ",
