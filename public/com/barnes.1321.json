    "html": "<p><em>Which say to the seers<\/em>&mdash;The prophets (see the note at <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NjU2XQ==\">Isaiah 1:1<\/a>).<\/p><p><em>See not<\/em>&mdash;They desire not that they should communicate to them the will of Yahweh.<\/p><p><em>Prophesy not unto us right things<\/em>&mdash;It is not probable that they &ldquo;openly&rdquo; demanded of the prophets that they should declare falsehood and deceit, but their conduct was as if they had required that. The sense is, they bore with impatience the theatenings and commands of the true prophets; they were offended at their plainness and their reproofs of their vices; and they preferred the false prophets, who fell in with their prejudices, and who did not denounce the judgment of God for their crimes.<\/p><p><em>Speak unto us smooth things<\/em>&mdash;That is, those things which are in accordance with our feelings, prejudices, and desires; which assure us of prosperity and success, and which will not disturb us with the apprehension of punishment. This was spoken particularly of their desire to make a league with Egypt, an enterprise for which the true prophets threatened them with the divine displeasure, but which probably the false prophets encouraged.<\/p><p><em>Prophesy deceits<\/em>&mdash;Not that they would openly and avowedly demand to be deceived, but they demanded that which the prophet says would be deceits. No man &ldquo;professedly&rdquo; desires to be deceived; but many a man is willing to put himself under that kind of teaching which is deceit, and which he might know to be falsehood if he would examine it.<\/p> ",
