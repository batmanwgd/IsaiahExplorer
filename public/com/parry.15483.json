The Lord challenges the false gods to prophesy, to tell what will happen in the future, an act that only God can do, often through his prophets.<\/p> <p><i>let them show the former things.<\/i> The false gods are not even able to tell things that have already happened, because they are not living. Even men are able to relate historical facts.<\/p> ",
