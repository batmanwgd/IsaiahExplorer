The Hebrew word properly means salvation, but the reference is to God as the Deliverer or Saviour. The immediate allusion is probably to the return from Babylon, but the remote and more important reference is to the coming of the Redeemer (see the notes at <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODQyMiI6MTB9\">Isaiah 40:1-10<\/a>). <\/p> <p> <em>Behold, his reward is with him <\/em>&mdash;See these words explained in the notes at <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDMxXQ==\">Isaiah 40:10<\/a>. <\/p> ",
