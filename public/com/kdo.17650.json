The daughter of Zion loses her sons, and consequently the daughters of Zion their husbands. - <em> \u201cThy men will fall by the sword, and thy might in war.\u201d<\/em> The plural <em> m ethim <\/em> (the singular of which only occurs in the form <em> m ethu <\/em> , with the connecting vowel <em> u\u0304 <\/em> as a component part of the proper names) is used as a prose word in the Pentateuch; but in the later literature it is a poetic archaism. <em> \u201cThy might\u201d<\/em> is used interchangeably with \u201cthy men,\u201d the possessors of the might being really intended, like <em> robur <\/em> and <em> robora <\/em> in Latin (compare <a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 49:35<\/a>).<\/p>",
