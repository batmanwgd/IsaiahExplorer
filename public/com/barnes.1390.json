    "html": "<p><em>Thine eyes<\/em>&mdash;The eyes of the righteous, described in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4Mjk1XQ==\">Isaiah 33:15<\/a>.<\/p><p><em>Shall see the king in his beauty<\/em>&mdash;Some understand this of the Assyrian king. Thus Kimchi understands it, and supposes it means that they shall see him at the walls of Jerusalem; that is, shall see him destroyed. Vitringa supposes it means Yahweh himself as the king of his people, and that they should see him in his glory. Others suppose it relates to the Messiah. But the immediate connection requires us to understand it of Hezekiah (compare the note at <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODI2MSI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 32:1-2<\/a>). The sense is, &lsquo;You shall be defended from the hostile army of the Assyrian. You shall be permitted to live under the peaceful and prosperous reign of your pious monarch, and shall see him, not with diminished territory and resources, but with the appropriate magnificence which becomes a monarch of Israel.&rsquo;<\/p><p><em>The land that is very far off<\/em>&mdash;You shall be permitted to look to the remotest part of the land of Judea as delivered from enemies, and as still under the happy scepter of your king. You shall not be confined by a siege, and straitened within the narrow walls of Jerusalem. The empire of Hezekiah shall be extended over the wide dominions that appropriately belong to him, and you shall be permitted to range freely over the whole land, even over the parts that are now occupied by the forces of the Assyrian. Virgil has a beautiful passage remarkably similar to this:<\/p><p>&mdash;jurat ire, et Dorica castra,<\/p><p>Desertosque videre locos, litusque relicturn.<\/p><p>AEn. ii. 28.<\/p>",
