The legions of Egypt are represented by the flies that swarmed on the banks of the Nile (<a class=\"ref\">Exodus 8:24<\/a>, and possibly <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3OTk5XQ==\">Isaiah 18:1<\/a>), those of Assyria by the bees of their forests and their hills (<a class=\"ref\">Deuteronomy 1:44; Psalms 118:12<\/a>).
