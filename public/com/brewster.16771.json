Jacob described and warned against such arrogance: \"O the vainness, and the frailties, and the foolishness of men! When they are learned they think they are wise, and they hearken not unto the counsel of God, for they set it aside, supposing they know of themselves, wherefore, their wisdom is foolishness and it profiteth them not. And they shall perish.\" (<a class=\"ref\">2 Nephi 9:28<\/a>; see also <a class=\"ref\">2 Nephi 28:15<\/a>.)<\/p>",
