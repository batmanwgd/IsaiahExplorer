    "html": " <p> <i>Because Jehovah hath overpowered you with the spirit of slumber.<\/i>, For the purpose of shewing more clearly the source of this blindness, he attributes it to the judgment of God, who determined to punish in this manner the wickedness of the people. As it belongs to him to give eyes to see, and to enlighten minds by the spirit of judgment and understanding, so he alone deprives us of all light, when he sees that by a wicked and depraved hatred of the truth we of our own accord wish for darkness. Accordingly, when men are blind, and especially in things so plain and obvious, we perceive his righteous judgment. <\/p>\n <p> <i>Your prophets and principal seers.<\/i>, He adds, that the people are deprived of those aids and helps which ought to have imparted light to the understanding and given direction to others. Such was the office of the prophets, whom he describes by both of these names, <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05e0\u05d1\u05d9\u05d0\u05d9\u05dd<\/span>, (<i>n\u0113b\u012b\u012bm<\/i>,) and <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d7\u05d6\u05d9\u05dd<\/span>, (<i>ch\u014dz\u012bm<\/i>,) \u201cprophets\u201d and \u201cseers.\u201d In short, he means not only that men who are endued with reason and understanding will be deprived of common sense, but that their teachers also, whose duty it was to enlighten others, will be altogether senseless so as not to know the road, and, being covered with the darkness of ignorance, will shamefully go astray, and will be so far from directing others that they will not even be able to guide themselves. <\/p>",
