    "html": " <p><i>The Lord promises that if we seek him we will find him, and if we ask of him we will receive. He also testifies that we will not find him if we do not seek. Unfortunately, as this chapter shows, the measure of iniquity in the world is full. The people willfully choose false forms of worship and provoke the Lord to anger. The Lord sends his servant to a nation that does not know him, as he sends many of us as missionaries to people who do not know us or the Lord.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>Though the wicked may continue in their sin for a time, eventually the Lord will bring them to judgment. Then the righteous will be blessed in every way, and those who reject the Lord will be cursed. Which group will we belong to\u2014those who accept the covenant in obedience, or those who go their own way? The culmination of the Lord's blessings will come in the Millennium, which day many of us might see.<\/i><\/p> ",
