He has power to declare events before they happen (46:10). He has power to do whatever he pleases (46:10). He can call helpers from faraway places (\"ravenous bird,\" \"man that executeth my counsel\"; 46:11). Those who are stubborn (\"stouthearted\") and wicked (\"far from righteousness\") need to take heed, for the Lord will be victor and Zion and righteous Israel will triumph with him (46:12-13).<\/p> <blockquote><i>Remember<\/i> this, and [show] yourselves <u>men<\/u>:     <br><i>bring it again to mind,<\/i> O ye <u>transgressors<\/u>.
