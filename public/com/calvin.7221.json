According to his custom, he illustrates the judgment of God more clearly by figures, which are fitted to produce an effect on sluggish minds. <\/p> \n <p> <i>The lofty people of the earth. <\/i> By the \u201clofty ones\u201d we must understand those eminent persons who held a higher rank than others; for this is more wonderful than if the common people had fallen. Yet if it be thought preferable to explain it as relating peculiarly to the Jews, I have no objection; for although the Assyrians and Egyptians excelled them in wealth and power, still the Jews held the highest rank in this respect, that they had been adopted by God. But I prefer the other exposition, which makes the meaning to be, that the Lord would inflict punishment, not only on common people, but also on those who surpassed others in rank and splendor. <\/p> ",
