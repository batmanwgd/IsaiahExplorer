It meets us there four times (, 65:9, 22), and is echoed and interpreted in the voice from heaven of <a class=\"ref\">Matthew 3:17<\/a>. That voice fixed on the human consciousness of the Son of Man that He was \u201cthe servant of the Lord,\u201d and throughout His life we trace an ever expanding and conscious reproduction of the chief features of Isaiah\u2019s picture. Disciples like St. Matthew learnt to recognise that likeness even in what might seem to us subordinate details (<a class=\"ref\">Matthew 12:17-21<\/a>). <\/p>\n <p>I have put my spirit . . .\u2014An echo from <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODg3XQ==\">Isaiah 11:2<\/a>, heard once more in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODQ1XQ==\">Isaiah 61:1<\/a>.

It expands the thought of <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzY4NyI6NH0=\">Isaiah 2:1-4<\/a>. There the Temple is the centre from which the knowledge and the \u201cjudgment\u201d (used here in the sense of law, or ordinance) flow; here it is from the personal teaching of \u201cthe servant.\u201d <\/p>",
