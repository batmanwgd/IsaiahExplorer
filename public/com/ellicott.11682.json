The Servant, once despised and forsaken, takes his place with them, though not in the same manner, or by the same means. We may have echoes of the words in our Lord\u2019s language as to the \u201cspoiling of the strong man\u201d ( <a class=\"ref\">Matthew 12:29<\/a>) as to the contrast between the greatness of His Kingdom and that of the rulers and great ones of the world ( <a class=\"ref\">Matthew 20:25; Mark 10:42; Luke 22:25<\/a>). The LXX., Vulg., Luther, and some modern scholars render, I will give him the multitude as a prey, the spoil \u201cof the mighty ones.\u201d<\/p> \n<p>Because he hath poured out . . .\u2014The absolutely voluntary character of the sacrifice is again emphasised. The next clause is better taken as he let himself be numbered.

The ideal Servant, contemned, condemned, failing, is seen, at last, to be identical with the ideal King.<\/p> ",
