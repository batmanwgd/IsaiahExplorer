These verses, or part of them, may also have been a part of Isaiah's writings at one time. Although we recognize the similarity between verse 15 and <a class=\"ref\">Mal. 4:1<\/a>, Nephi's words could not have come from this book. Malachi had not written his work at the time Lehi left Jerusalem, so it could not have been included on the plates of brass. It might very well be that Malachi, living several hundred years after Isaiah, was quoting from the original Isaiah text. <\/p>     ",
