    "html": "<p><b>(<a class=\"ref\">Mosiah 12:22; 15:29; 3 Nephi 16:18; 20:32<\/a>).<\/b>\"<i>Thy watchmen shall lift up the voice.<\/i>\" There are minor differences in these texts, the most notable being the Savior's use of \"<i>their<\/i> watchmen\" in His second recitation of the verse. In this instance He was referring to the watchmen of Jerusalem rather than those in Zion. Watchmen are charged with the responsibility of safeguarding the people of the Lord and of keeping the doctrines of His gospel pure. Speaking for himself and others called to serve in the governing councils of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, President Spencer W. Kimball declared, \"We continue to warn the people and plead with them, for we are watchmen upon the towers, and in our hands we have a trumpet which we must blow loudly and sound the alarm.\" (DCE, 626.)<\/p>     <p>At the great day of the Millennium, the watchmen will no longer need to be on the lookout for iniquity; they will lift up their united voices in song and worshipful praise rather than in crying repentance.<\/p>",
