Or rather, the prophet here, in metaphorical expressions, borrowed from an earthquake, signifies how terribly Judea should be shaken by wars, desolations, and other divine judgments, to the entire overthrow of their church and commonwealth; <i>and shall be removed <\/i>\u2014 The people shall be removed, or their constitution, civil and religious, <i>like a cottage <\/i>\u2014 Or, <i>like a lodge <\/i>in a garden, of which this word is used, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 1:8<\/a>, which is soon taken down and set up in another place: <i>or, like a tent, <\/i>which is easily and commonly carried from place to place. <i>And the transgression thereof shall be heavy upon it <\/i>\u2014 Upon their state and nation, especially the sin of crucifying the Lord of glory. <i>And it shall fall <\/i>\u2014 Their government shall be overturned, their state dissolved, and their nation ruined; <i>and not rise again <\/i>\u2014 Not till the latter days, when they shall believe in and receive Him whom they rejected and crucified.<\/p>",
