It was evidently in Mesopotamia, and was probably the same which was afterward called Ana, situated near a ford of the Euphrates. The situation of Ivah is not certainly known. It was under the Assyrian dominion, and was one of the places from which colonists were brought to Samaria <a class=\"ref\">2 Kings 17:24, 2 Kings 17:31<\/a>. Michaelis supposes that it was between Berytus and Tripoli, but was under the dominion of the Assyrians.<\/p>",
