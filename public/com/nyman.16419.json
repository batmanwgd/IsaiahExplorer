Satan, who had had such a great influence upon the kingdoms of the earth, is now powerless and unable to do anything for those who are prisoners. As Mormon abridged the records of the Nephites, he warned against the outcome of those who perverted the ways of the Lord and followed the devil (see <a class=\"ref\">Alma 30:60<\/a>). The state of such individuals is described in this passage of Isaiah.<\/p>     ",
