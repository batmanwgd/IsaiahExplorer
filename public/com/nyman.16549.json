A woman's love for her offspring is considered to be one of the strongest bonds that exist, but the Lord's love and promises are even stronger and are never forgotten. Zion (the Americas) was the land given to the children of the house of Joseph (see <a class=\"ref\">3 Ne. 15:12-13; Gen. 49:22-26<\/a>). The Lord has promised that the New Jerusalem, the epitome of beauty, will be established upon this land (see 3 <a class=\"ref\">1 Ne. 20:22<\/a>). The Prophet Joseph Smith said concerning the location of Zion:<\/p>     <p>You know there has been great discussion in relation to Zion-where it is, and where the gathering of the dispensation is, and which I am now going to tell you. The prophets have spoken and written upon it; but I will make a proclamation that will cover a broader ground. The <i>whole of America is Zion itself from north to south, and is described by the Prophets, who declare that it is the Zion where the mountain of the Lord should be, and that it should be in the center of the land.<\/i> When Elders shall take up and examine the old prophecies in the Bible, they will see it. (TPJS, p. 362.)<\/p>     <p>Isaiah's representing the land of Zion as speaking in verse 14 is consistent with another scripture (see <a class=\"ref\">Moses 7:48-49<\/a>). The Book of Mormon retains the identifying phrase \"O house of Israel\" at the end of verse 15.<\/p>     ",
