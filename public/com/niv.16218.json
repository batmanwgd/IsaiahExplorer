More recent thinking has suggested that the real significance of the material is not as a new call but as an extension and expansion of chapter 6. No longer is the prophetic message to be primarily one of judgment. That point has been made and will be confirmed in the fires of the Exile. Now, however, the message is to be one of hope. Special prominence is given to speech in the passage. Although the people have withered and fallen like dried grass, God\u2019s word as spoken by his prophet will not fail. Just as he had said that judgment would come, and it had, so he now says restoration will come, and it will!<\/p>     <p>\u2003Verses 1 and 2 provide an introduction and set the tone for the following three three-verse stanzas. The idea of the word translated \u201ccomfort\u201d (v. 1) is to \u201cencourage,\u201d as is \u201cspeak tenderly\u201d (v. 2). Isaiah sees a day when God\u2019s servants will be crushed to the ground under the burden of their sins. They will feel sure that all is lost and that all the promises have been nullified by their rebellion. But the message to be proclaimed to them is that this is not so. The Exile is not to destroy them but only to punish them. Now that punishment is complete (\u201cdouble\u201d), and God has a word of hope for them.<\/p>     <p>\u2003In the first stanza (40:3\u20135), some of the language of chapter 35 is resumed. There is a \u201chighway\u201d in the \u201cdesert\/wilderness.\u201d But in this case, the highway is for \u201cour God.\u201d As in 52:7 and 63:1, it is God who comes to helpless Zion to set her free. Nothing can prevent his swift coming to his people\u2019s aid, neither mountains nor valleys. The highway will be level and straight, so that God can come quickly. Once again, the identity of the one speaking is not important. Rather, it is the word to be spoken. If there is to be deliverance for God\u2019s people, it must come from God\u2019s direct intervention. There is no other hope.<\/p>     <p>\u2003That fact is underlined in the second stanza (40:6\u20138), where perhaps another voice (though possibly the same voice as in vv. 3\u20135) cries out that \u201call men [Heb. flesh] are like grass.\u201d This has a twofold implication. On the one hand, Judean flesh is like grass. They have been consumed by their sins, and there is no permanence in them at all, nor is there anything they can do to help themselves. But it is also true that Babylonian flesh is as grass. If the Judeans are to be delivered, God will have to do it. But if he <em>does<\/em> decide to do it, there is nothing the Babylonians can do to prevent it. There is no permanence in anything human, but if God speaks a promise, that \u201cword\u201d will stand, and nothing earthly can alter it.<\/p>     <p>\u2003Because that is so, \u201cZion\u201d has a word to declare to the surrounding villages. There is some controversy about the speaker in this final stanza (40:9\u201311). One possibility is that represented in the NIV text, namely, that there is yet a third unidentified speaker, who is commanded to bring the \u201cgood tidings to Zion.\u201d There is a certain attractiveness to this proposal since the content of the previous stanzas has been addressed to Zion.<\/p>     <p>\u2003However, the most natural way to read the Hebrew is that Zion is this messenger of good tidings. There is a consistency in that point of view also, in that Zion\u2019s place is not merely as a recipient of God\u2019s grace but also as a messenger of that grace to the surrounding world. The good news, as it is stated later in 52:7, is about the intervention of God in the world: He \u201ccomes.\u201d The Creator breaks into his world, both to break the power of evil with his strong \u201carm\u201d (40:10) and, \u201clike a shepherd,\u201d to gather up the broken in his gentle \u201carms.\u201d<\/p>     ",
