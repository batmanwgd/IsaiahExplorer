Baldness (not natural baldness, but the shaving of the hair) was a great shame and signified great calamity (compare<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzMyXQ==\">Isaiah 3:24<\/a>). The Lord suggests that when Judah saw their impending doom they should have seen it as a call to deep repentance and clothed themselves with sackcloth and baldness. Instead, they acted as though they had been called to a joyous feast, and they were singing the refrain of the world: &ldquo;let us eat and drink; for to morrow we shall die&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MDY2XQ==\">Isaiah 22:13<\/a>). As is typical of the wicked in a time of crisis, they would prefer to indulge their passions than to repent (see<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODA3MCI6M30=\">vv. 17&ndash;19<\/a>).<\/p><p class=\"cite\"> LDS Church Educational System Old Testament Student Manual, 1 Kings&ndash;Malachi, Religion 302, Chapter 14, Item 39<\/p> ",
