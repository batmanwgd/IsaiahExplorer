Sennacherib, soon after his return from his Egyptian expedition, which, I imagine, took him up three years, invested Jerusalem. He is represented by the prophet as lifting up his rod in his march from Egypt, and threatening the people of God, as Pharaoh and the Egyptians had done when they pursued them to the Red Sea. But God in his turn will lift up his rod over the sea, as he did at that time, in the way, or after the manner, of Egypt; and as Sennacherib has imitated the Egyptians in his threats, and came full of rage against them from the same quarter; so God will act over again the same part that he had taken formerly in Egypt, and overthrow their enemies in as signal a manner. It was all to be, both the attack and the deliverance, <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d1\u05d3\u05e8\u05da <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">bederech<\/span>, or <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05db\u05d3\u05e8\u05da <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">kederech<\/span>, as a MS. has it in each place, in the way, or after the manner, of Egypt.<\/p>",
