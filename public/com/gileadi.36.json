Those who were &ldquo;your people&rdquo;&mdash;expressing the covenant formula (<a class=\"ref\">Exodus 6:7; Leviticus 26:12<\/a>)&mdash;now follow the customs of the peoples round about against which Moses had warned (<a class=\"ref\">Deuteronomy 12:29-31; 31:16-18<\/a>). Jehovah&rsquo;s covenants with his people comprehend all the divine knowledge a people can possibly attain. To turn to pagan sources for spiritual enlightenment is to cut oneself off from the light that Jehovah personifies (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NjkxXQ==\">v 5<\/a>).<\/p> ",
