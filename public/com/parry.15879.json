Perhaps the idea here is that the Lord desired to raise up some kind of intercessor among mortals and was troubled that there was none.<\/p> <p><i>no intercessor.<\/i> There was no one to intercede for the Lord's covenant people, no one to help them in their bondage. The context suggests that the intercession here may not be that of the Atonement but of the Second Coming.<\/p> <p><i>his arm brought salvation unto him.<\/i> The Lord himself became the intercessor. His arm, which symbolizes his power, became the force that brought salvation or deliverance to his people.<\/p> <p><i>his righteousness&hellip;sustained him.<\/i> The Lord was able to deliver Zion because of his personal righteousness.<\/p> ",
