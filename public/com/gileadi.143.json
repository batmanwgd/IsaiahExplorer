A similar synonymous parallelism identifies &ldquo;forests&rdquo; as &ldquo;cities&rdquo;: &ldquo;By a hail shall <em>forests <\/em>,be felled, <em>cities <\/em>,utterly leveled&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4Mjc5XQ==\">Isaiah 32:19 <\/a>; emphasis added). Although the fire that burns them up is the king of Assyria\/Babylon&mdash;Jehovah&rsquo;s <em>anger <\/em>,and <em>wrath <\/em>,, his <em>fire <\/em>,and <em>sword <\/em>,(cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODI0NV0seyIxODkzOCI6Mn1d\">Isaiah 30:27; 66:15-16 <\/a>)&mdash;the people&rsquo;s wickedness is the cause.
