    "html": " <p><i>We are of the house of Israel, and here the Lord calls us to hearken. He has sent a servant to testify of truth and to help restore Israel to her promised blessings. Through the efforts of such servants, the Lord will gather Israel from all parts of the earth. We in the latter days are privileged to help in this gathering work. As we stand as missionaries to our neighbors, inviting them to come and partake of the blessings of the gospel, we are joining the Lord's servant in his work and helping to bring to pass the prophecies about the deliverance and the gathering of Israel. Those who are so gathered will be greatly blessed. The Lord will open the way for them to return to him; he will lead and guide them and provide for their every spiritual need.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>This passage has a wonderful message of comfort to all who suffer and feel lost in the world. \"Can a woman forget her sucking child?\" the Lord asks. \"Yea, they may forget, yet will I not forget thee\" (49:15)<\/i><\/p> <p><i>In the gathering, the Lord will send many helpers: kings and queens will bring in their arms and on their shoulders those who have been lost.<\/i><\/p> ",
