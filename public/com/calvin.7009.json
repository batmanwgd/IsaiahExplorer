Thus he foretells the destruction and ruin of Judea, which he compares to the<i>cutting down of a forest<\/i> ; by which he means that there is nothing so valuable that the enemies will not destroy it, till they have stripped the whole land of its ornaments.<\/p> \n<p><i>And Lebanon will fall violently. <\/i> He mentions<i>Lebanon<\/i> , because that mountain, as we all know, was highly celebrated for fruitful and highly valuable trees. Now, if he had been speaking of the Assyrians, it would not have been appropriate to introduce the destruction of<i>Lebanon<\/i> . Hence we infer that the Prophet, in this passage, again threatens the Jews; and this agrees well with the introduction of the discourse, for it begins with a word which calls attention, <i>Behold. <\/i><\/p> ",
