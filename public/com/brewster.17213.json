    "html": "<p>Seven hundred years before the birth of the Messiah, the prophet Isaiah saw in vision the rejection and sorrow that would be suffered by the Son of God during His mortal sojourn. He witnessed the events of those final earthly moments when Jesus Christ would personally pay the price for all mankind's sins and would then give His life as part of the ransom to be paid for the redemption of all.<\/p>     <p>About five hundred and fifty years after Isaiah recorded this great prophecy, another prophet, by the name of Abinadi, quoted it to a people who were steeped in wickedness. Speaking with great \"power and authority from God,\" Abinadi boldly called them to repentance. He recited the Ten Commandments and proclaimed that \"salvation doth not come by the law alone\" but requires the intervention (atonement) of God (Jehovah or Jesus Christ) Himself. He reminded the people that since the beginning of time on this earth, all the prophets have testified of the mission of this Messiah. (<a class=\"ref\">Mosiah 13<\/a>.) Abinadi then quoted the fifty-third chapter of Isaiah in its entirety, in what is now <a class=\"ref\">Mosiah 14<\/a>. During the rest of his sermon, he then provided some commentary.<\/p>     <p>President Joseph Fielding Smith observed: \"Now <i>Bible<\/i> commentators will tell you that this [<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 53]<\/a> has nothing to do with the life of Jesus Christ. To them this story is one concerning suffering Israel. I want to tell you that it is a story, a synopsis of the life of our Redeemer, revealed to <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzEzXQ==\">I<\/a>saiah 700 years before the Lord was born.\" (DS 1:23.)<\/p>",
