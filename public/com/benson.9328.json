    "html": "<p> <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODMyNiI6M30=\">Isaiah 35:5-7<\/a>. <i>Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened<\/i>\u2014The poor Gentiles, who before were blind and deaf, shall now have the eyes and ears of their minds opened to see God\u2019s works, and to hear and receive his word. And, in token hereof, many persons who are literally and corporally blind and deaf, shall have sight and hearing miraculously conferred upon them; all which things being so fully accomplished in Christ, and, as has been just observed, applied by him to himself, it is plain that this prophecy belongs primarily to the times of the gospel. <i>Then shall the lame leap as a hart<\/i>\u2014For joy, or shall proceed readily and nimbly in the way of duty. <i>And the tongue of the dumb shall sing<\/i>\u2014The praises of his Redeemer and Saviour. <i>For in the wilderness shall waters break out<\/i>\u2014The most dry and barren places shall be made moist and fruitful: which is principally meant of the plentiful effusion of God\u2019s grace upon such persons and nations as had been wholly destitute of it. <i>In the habitation of dragons shall be grass,<\/i> &c.\u2014Those dry and parched deserts, in which dragons have their abode, shall yield abundance of grass, and reeds, and rushes, which grow only in moist ground. Thus it was when Christian churches were planted and flourished in the cities of the Gentiles, which for many ages had been habitations of dragons, or rather of devils, <a class=\"ref\">Revelation 18:2<\/a>. When the property of the idols\u2019 temples was altered, and they were converted to the service of Christianity, then the habitations of dragons became fruitful fields.<\/p> ",
