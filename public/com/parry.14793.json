    "html": " <i>yoke\/staff\/rod.<\/i> In biblical times the staff and rod were instruments used by taskmasters on the slaves; a yoke was a wooden frame designed to harness together beasts of burden. These three items\u2014the <i>yoke, staff,<\/i> and <i>rod\u2014<\/i>signify forms of oppression, or the manner in which Israel had been burdened by her neighbors (10:5, 24-27). In particular, the language of this verse recalls the manner in which Egypt oppressed the Israelites before Moses led them out of captivity (for example, see <i>yoke <\/i>in <a class=\"ref\">Lev. 26:13<\/a>; <i>burden<\/i> in <a class=\"ref\">Ex. 1:11; 2:11<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\"> 5:4; 6:6<\/a>; and <i>taskmasters<\/i> in <a class=\"ref\">Ex. 3:7; 5:6<\/a>, <a class=\"ref\"> 10-14<\/a>). Just as Moses delivered ancient Israel from the Egyptian yoke of physical bondage, Jesus Christ delivers us from the yoke of spiritual bondage.<\/p> ",
