For the prophet here evidently intends to express the punishment of their dulness.<i> With stammering lips, and another tongue<\/i> \u2014 By people of a strange language, whom he will bring among them, and into whose power he will deliver them;<i> will he speak to this people<\/i> \u2014 Seeing they will not hear him speaking by his prophets and ministers, in their own language, they shall hear their enemies speaking to them in a strange language. It was a great aggravation of the misery of the Jews, during their captivity, that they did not understand the language of the Chaldeans, whose captives they were.<i> To whom he said<\/i> \u2014 To which people, the Lord, by his ministers, said,<i> This<\/i> \u2014 This doctrine, or the word of the Lord, as it follows,<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTc4XQ==\">Isaiah 28:13<\/a> ;<i> is the rest<\/i> \u2014 The only way, in the observance of which you will find rest.<i> Wherewith,<\/i> &c. \u2014 The word<i> wherewith<\/i> is supplied by our translators, there being nothing for it in the Hebrew, which is,<i> cause ye the weary to rest<\/i> \u2014 Namely, your weary minds and weary country. As if he had said, As rest is offered you by the prophets in God\u2019s name, do you embrace it; which is to be done by hearkening to God\u2019s word. So shall this people, which hath been so often, and so long, wearied and harassed by great and manifold calamities, find rest and peace.<i> Yet they would not hear<\/i> \u2014 They were wilfully ignorant, and obstinately refused the very means of instruction.<\/p> ",
