The verb is used in <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 42:4<\/a> of a festal procession to the Temple, but here refers simply to the journey of life, and implies that it is to be carried on to the end as with calm and considerate steps. The Authorised Version suggests wrongly the thought of a life-long bitterness.<\/p> ",
