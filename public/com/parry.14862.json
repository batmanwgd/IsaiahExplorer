Behold, thus saith the Lord, it is a descendant of Jesse, as well as of Joseph, unto whom rightly belongs the priesthood, and the keys of the kingdom, for an ensign, and for the gathering of my people in the last days\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 113:5-6; Rom. 15:12<\/a>). Latter-day Saint scholars generally agree that the <i>root of Jesse<\/i> refers to the Prophet Joseph Smith. He is a descendant of both Jesse and Joseph; he held the priesthood; he possessed the keys of the kingdom; he played a primary role in the lifting of the ensign upon the tops of the mountains; and the keys of the gathering of Israel were committed into his hands (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 110:11<\/a>). This prophecy may also be fulfilled by another prophet yet to come, who shall also have the characteristics Isaiah saw.<\/p> <p><i>an ensign of the people; to [him] shall the Gentiles seek.<\/i> A modern revelation explains that God's everlasting covenant is a standard or <i>ensign<\/i> that the <i>Gentiles<\/i> shall <i>seek<\/i> (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 45:9<\/a>). In another revelation Zion \"shall be an ensign unto the people, and there shall come unto her out of every nation under heaven\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 64:42<\/a>). Here Isaiah suggests that the <i>root of Jesse<\/i> is also <i>an ensign<\/i> and <i>to him shall the Gentiles seek.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>rest.<\/i> This prophet's rest in the presence of God will be glorious. The meaning of <i>rest<\/i> is presented in the scriptures (JST <a class=\"ref\">Ex. 34:2; Alma 40:12<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 84:23-24<\/a>). <\/p> ",
