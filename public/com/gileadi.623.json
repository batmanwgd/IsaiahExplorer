    "html": "<p>Jehovah&rsquo;s ancient covenant people, now received back, remarry their Redeemer whom they long repudiated. The account of his taking back his former spouse thus abounds in covenant language. Terms such as &ldquo;loving compassion&rdquo; and &ldquo;everlasting charity&rdquo; denote an unconditional and eternal covenant. The words &ldquo;I forsook you, indeed, momentarily&rdquo; and &ldquo;in fleeting exasperation I hid my face from you&rdquo; express justified actions, showing that consequences for transgression in the form of covenant curses are, in the end, designed to bring Jehovah&rsquo;s people back into a blessed relationship with him.<\/p>",
