His personifying Jehovah&rsquo;s <em>anger <\/em> and <em>wrath <\/em> toward a corrupt humanity accords with Jehovah&rsquo;s design to convince the earth&rsquo;s inhabitants to repent of evil. Jehovah thus uses the wicked to destroy the wicked and to induce those who might be persuaded to return to him.
