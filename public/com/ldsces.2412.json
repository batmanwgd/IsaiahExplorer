    "html": "<p>God&rsquo;s promises to Israel were stated in a direct way in the Abrahamic covenant. Most Latter-day Saints have patriarchal blessings that declare their descent from Abraham through one of the twelve tribes. Abraham, then, is the &ldquo;rock&rdquo; from whence Israel was hewn and the &ldquo;pit&rdquo; from whence they were digged. Israel, both ancient and modern, is urged to &ldquo;look unto Abraham [our] father, and unto Sarah&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 51:1&ndash;2<\/a>). They are the ones through whom the Saints claim their promised blessings. By means of the covenant established with Abraham and Sarah, &ldquo;the Lord shall comfort Zion&rdquo; and make &ldquo;her desert like the garden of the Lord&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTg2Nzc=\">v. 3<\/a>). This passage is a plain assurance that God will fulfill for Abraham and his descendants all that He has promised in the covenant.<\/p><p class=\"cite\">LDS Church Educational System Old Testament Student Manual, 1 Kings&ndash;Malachi, Religion 302, Chapter 17, Item 12<\/p>",
