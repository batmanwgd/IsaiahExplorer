    "html": "<p>To indicate that all isn&rsquo;t gloom and doom&mdash;while at the same time inferring how few righteous people remain when compared to the wicked&mdash;Isaiah inserts a single, hopeful line. Elsewhere, he predicts that the righteous who keep faith with Jehovah through troubled times ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgxMzIiOjN9LFsxODI4Nl1d\">Isaiah 26:1-3; 33:6<\/a>) are gathered to safety before calamity strikes ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3OTEwLDE4NzY3XQ==\">Isaiah 13:3; 57:1<\/a>). The term &ldquo;well&rdquo; or &ldquo;good&rdquo; (<em>tob<\/em>) connotes covenant blessings, suggesting that those who keep the terms of Jehovah&rsquo;s covenant, who have laid up &ldquo;the fruits of their own labors&rdquo; for the evil day, enjoy sufficiency even as others starve (cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzE1XQ==\">v 7<\/a>).<\/p> ",
