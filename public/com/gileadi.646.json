She is supplanted by the Daughter of Zion, the loyal wife whom he marries by an everlasting covenant (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODM3NV0seyIxODcyOSI6Nn1d\">Isaiah 37:22; 54:5-10<\/a>). Today&rsquo;s pornographic imagery, lewd movies, and revealing posters easily qualify as the Harlot&rsquo;s &ldquo;emblems&rdquo; of fornication. The &ldquo;lofty mountain&rdquo; alludes to the elite nation of Jehovah&rsquo;s people from whence she sells her sex and porn to the world.<\/p>",
