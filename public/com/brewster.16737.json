So many men will have been killed in wars (see <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzMzXQ==\">Isaiah 3:25<\/a>) that there will be a shortage of eligible marriage partners for single women. \"Seven women\" (symbolically meaning \"many\") will propose marriage to \"one man.\" Contrary to law, which requires the husband to provide for the wife (<a class=\"ref\">Exodus 21:10<\/a>), in these desperate times the women will pledge to provide the necessities of life for themselves.<\/p>",
