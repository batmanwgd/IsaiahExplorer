    "html": " <p>(24) Therefore saith the Lord.\u2014The word for \u201csaith\u201d (literally, whisper) is that which always indicates the solemn utterance of an oracle. The solemnity is emphasised by the exceptional accumulation of Divine names. He who speaks is the Eternal, the Lord of the armies of earth and heaven, the Hero, the Mighty One, of Israel. The latter name is found also in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NjYzXQ==\">Isaiah 49:26<\/a>; <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODM4XQ==\">Isaiah 60:16<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\">Genesis 49:24; Psalms 132:2; Psalms 132:5<\/a>, and not elsewhere. <\/p>\n <p>Ah, I will ease me of mine adversaries.\u2014In bold, anthropomorphic language, which reminds us of <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 78:65<\/a>, Jehovah is represented as waking out of slumber, and rising up to judgment. The words \u201cease\u201d and \u201cavenge\u201d in the Hebrew have nearly the same sound (nicham and niqqam), and come from the same root, the primary thought being that of the deep breath which a man draws in the act of throwing off a burden. The weariness and impatience of <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NjY5XQ==\">Isaiah 1:14<\/a>, the long-suffering that waited, had come to an end at last (comp. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzUxXQ==\">Isaiah 5:11<\/a>; <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzUzXQ==\">Isaiah 5:13<\/a>), and the day of vengeance had come. The punishment was, however, to be reformatory, and not merely penal. <\/p>",
