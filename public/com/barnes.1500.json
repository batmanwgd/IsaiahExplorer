The phrase &lsquo;these things,&rsquo; refers evidently to the promises of God and their fulfillment; and the idea is, that people are sustained in the land of the living only by such gracious interpositions as he had experienced. It was not because people had any power of preserving their own lives, but because God interposed in time of trouble, and restored to health when there was no human prospect that they could recover. <\/p> <p> <em>And in all these things <\/em>&mdash;In these promises, and in the divine interposition. <\/p> <p> <em>Is the life of my spirit <\/em>&mdash;I am alive in virtue only of these things. <\/p> <p> <em>So wilt thou recover me <\/em>&mdash;Or so hast thou recovered me; that is, thou hast restored me to health. <\/p> ",
