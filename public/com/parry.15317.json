Rivers<\/i> and <i>streams<\/i> are metaphors for the Lord, who provides us with the \"waters of life\" (see commentary on 8:6). Notice the abundance of water\u2014<i>broad rivers and streams\u2014<\/i>available to those who wish to partake.<\/p> <p><i>wherein shall go no galley with oars, neither shall gallant ship pass. <\/i>In ancient times large warships transported armies. These galleys were often powered by slaves, and on return trips to the homeland the galleys were often loaded with spoils and captives. Isaiah states that such ships will not pass over the broad rivers and streams, indicating that the Lord will protect those who have access to him. The New International Version translates <i>gallant ship<\/i> as <i>mighty ship.<\/i><\/p> ",
