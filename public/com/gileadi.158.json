The archtyrant&mdash;Jehovah&rsquo;s <em>rod<\/em> of punishment and <em>staff<\/em> of submission, who personifies his <em>anger<\/em> and <em>wrath<\/em> (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODU2LDE3ODY2XQ==\">vv 5, 15<\/a>)&mdash;has but temporary power over them. Jehovah&rsquo;s purpose is to induce his people to ascend to higher spiritual levels. Because the archtyrant&rsquo;s wrath exceeds all bounds as he seeks to destroy Jehovah&rsquo;s elect, he must fall (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 31:4-9<\/a>).<\/p>",
