Jehovah sends the tempestuous Assyrian horde&mdash;the archtyrant and his military alliance&mdash;to make war on Jehovah&rsquo;s people and on all nations. The tumult and uproar they cause in the world stems from their hatred toward Israel&rsquo;s God and his people: &ldquo;Woe to the many peoples in an uproar, who rage like the raging of the seas&mdash;tumultuous nations, in commotion like the turbulence of mighty waters!&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3OTk2XQ==\">Isaiah 17:12<\/a>).<\/p>",
