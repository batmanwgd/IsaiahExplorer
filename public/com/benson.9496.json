Or, <i>before thee, <\/i>as the Hebrew may be rendered, so as thine eyes shall behold it.<\/p>\n<p><i>Behold, I have created the smith, <\/i>&c. \u2014 Both the smith that makes warlike instruments, and the soldier that uses them, are my creatures, and totally at my command, and therefore they cannot hurt you without my leave. <i>I have created the waster, <\/i>&c. \u2014 To destroy only whom and when I please. <i>No weapon formed against thee shall prosper <\/i>\u2014 As they cannot do any thing against thee without my leave, so I assure thee I will not suffer them really to injure thee; <i>and every tongue, &c., shalt thou condemn <\/i>\u2014 And I will deliver thee, not only from the fury of war, but also from the strife of tongues. <i>This is the heritage of the servants of the Lord \u2014 <\/i>This blessed condition is the portion allotted them by me. <i>And their righteousness <\/i>\u2014 The reward of their righteousness; <i>is of me <\/i>\u2014 I give it, and I will continue it to them. <\/p>",
