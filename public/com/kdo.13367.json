    "html": "<p>There is nothing to surprise us in the fact, that the prophet returns again and again to the alliance with Egypt. After his warning had failed to prevent it, he wrestled with it in spirit, set before himself afresh the curse which would be its certain fruit, brought out and unfolded the consolation of believers that lay hidden in the curse, and did not rest till the cursed fruit, that had become a real thing, had been swallowed up by the promise, which was equally real. The situation of this fourth woe is just the same as that of the previous one. The alliance with Egypt is still in progress. <i>\u201cWoe to them that go down to Egypt for help, and rely upon horses, and put their trust in chariots, that there are many of them; and in horsemen, that there is a powerful multitude of them; and do not look up to the Holy One of Israel, and do not inquire for Jehovah! And yet He also is wise; thus then He brings evil, and sets not His words aside; and rises up against the house of miscreants, and against the help of evil-doers. And Egypt is man, and not God; and its horses flesh, and not spirit. And when Jehovah stretches out His hand, the helper stumbles, and he that is helped falls, and they all perish together.\u201d<\/i> The expression \u201cthem that go down\u201d (<i>(<span class=\"translit\">hayyo\u0304red\u0131\u0304m<\/span>)) does not imply that the going down was taking place just then for the first time. It is the participle of qualification, just as God is called <span class=\"normal hebrew\">\u05d4\ufb31\u05e8\u05d0<\/span>. <span class=\"normal hebrew\">\u05dc\u05e2\u05d6\u05e8\u05d4<\/span> with <i>Lamed<\/i> of the object, as in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MDM2XQ==\">Isaiah 20:6<\/a>. The horses, chariots, and horsemen here, as those of Egypt, which Diodorus calls <span class=\"greek normal\"> \u03b9\u0314\u03c0\u03c0\u03b1\u0301\u03c3\u03b9\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 <\/span>, on account of its soil being so suitable for cavalry (see Lepsius in Herzog's <i>Cyclopaedia<\/i>). The participle is combined in the finite verb. Instead of <span class=\"normal hebrew\">\u05d5\u05e2\u05dc\u05be\u05e1\ufb35\u05e1\u05d9\u05dd<\/span>, we also find the reading preferred by Norzi, of <span class=\"normal hebrew\">\u05e2\u05dc<\/span> without <i>Vav<\/i>, as in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzUxXQ==\">Isaiah 5:11<\/a> (cf., <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzYzXQ==\">Isaiah 5:23<\/a>). The perfects, <span class=\"normal hebrew\">\u05e9\u05c1\u05e2\ufb35<\/span> <span class=\"normal hebrew\">\u05dc\u05d0<\/span> and <span class=\"normal hebrew\">\u05d3\u05e8\u05e9\u05c1\ufb35<\/span> <span class=\"normal hebrew\">\u05dc\u05d0<\/span>, are used without any definite time, to denote that which was always wanting in them. The circumstantial clause, \u201cwhilst He is assuredly also wise,\u201d i.e., will bear comparison with their wisdom and that of Egypt, is a touching <span class=\"greek normal\"> \u03bc\u03b5\u03b9\u0301\u03c9\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 <\/span>. It was not necessary to think very highly of Jehovah, in order to perceive the reprehensible and destructive character of their apostasy from Him. The fut. consec. <span class=\"normal hebrew\">\u05d5\ufb39\u05d1\u05d0<\/span> is used to indicate the inevitable consequence of their despising Him who is also wise. He will not set aside His threatening words, but carry them out. The house of miscreants is Judah (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NjU5XQ==\">Isaiah 1:4<\/a>); and the help (<i>abstr. pro concr.<\/i>, just as Jehovah is frequently called \u201cmy help,\u201d (<span class=\"translit\">\u201bezra\u0302th\u0131\u0304<\/span>), by the Psalmist) of evil-doers is Egypt, whose help has been sought by Judah. The latter is \u201cman\u201d ((<span class=\"translit\">'a\u0302da\u0302m<\/span>)), and its horses \u201cflesh\u201d ((<span class=\"translit\">ba\u0302sa\u0302r<\/span>)); whereas Jehovah is God ((<span class=\"translit\">El<\/span>)) and spirit ((<span class=\"translit\">ru\u0304a\u0306ch<\/span>); see Psychol.<\/i> p. 85). Hofmann expounds it correctly: \u201cAs ruuach has life in itself, it is opposed to the (<span class=\"translit\">ba\u0302sa\u0302r<\/span>), which is only rendered living through the (<span class=\"translit\">ru\u0304a\u0306ch<\/span>); and so (<span class=\"translit\">El<\/span>) is opposed to the corporeal (<span class=\"translit\">'a\u0302da\u0302m<\/span>), who needs the spirit in order to live at all.\u201d Thus have they preferred the help of the impotent and conditioned, to the help of the almighty and all-conditioning One. Jehovah, who is God and spirit, only requires to stretch out His hand (an anthropomorphism, by the side of which we find the rule for interpreting it); and the helpers, and those who are helped (i.e., according to the terms of the treaty, though not in reality), that is to say, both the source of the help and the object of help, are all cast into one heap together.<br><\/p>",
