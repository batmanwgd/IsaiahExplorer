The idea is taken from the nature of the land of Canaan; which was full of caves and dens; <i>for fear of the Lord, and the glory of his majesty, <\/i>&c. \u2014 \u201cThe meaning is, that there should be, at this time, a great and most bright display of the divine majesty and justice, which the impious and hypocritical could not bear; and that, struck with the terror of the divine judgment, they should consult for their safety, with the utmost terror and consternation, in caves, dens, and holes of the earth.\u201d \u201cThe Prophet Hosea hath carried the same image further, and added great strength and spirit to it, <a class=\"ref\">Hosea 10:8<\/a>. <i>They shall say to the mountains, Cover us; and to the hills, Fall on us; <\/i>which image, together with these of Isaiah, is adopted by the sublime author of the <a class=\"ref\">Revelation 6:15-16<\/a>.\u201d See Dodd and Bishop Lowth.<\/p>",
