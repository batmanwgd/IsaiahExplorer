It means that there was a tremour, or concussion, as if by awe, or by the sound attending the cry. It is evidently a poetic expression.<\/p><p><em>The house<\/em>&mdash;The temple.<\/p><p><em>Was filled with smoke<\/em>&mdash;There is here, doubtless, a reference to &ldquo;the cloud&rdquo; that is so often mentioned in the Old Testament as the visible symbol of the Divinity; see the note at <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzM5XQ==\">Isaiah 4:5<\/a>.
