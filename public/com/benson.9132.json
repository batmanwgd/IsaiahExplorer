    "html": "<p> <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3OTYyXQ==\">Isaiah 15:1<\/a>. <i>The burden of Moab<\/i>\u2014A prophecy of the destruction of the Moabites, the inveterate and implacable enemies of the Jews, begun by the Assyrian, and finished by the Babylonian monarchs. This prophecy, which occupies this and the next chapter, very improperly separated from each other, makes the third discourse of this second part. The time of the delivery, and consequently of the completion of it, (which was to be in three years after,) is uncertain, neither of them being marked in the prophecy, nor recorded in history. \u201cBut the most probable account is, that it was delivered soon after the foregoing, in the first year of Hezekiah; and that it was accomplished in his fourth year, when Shalmaneser invaded the kingdom of Israel. He might probably march through Moab; and, to secure every thing behind him, possess himself of the whole country, by taking the principal strong places, Ar and Kir-haresh. Jeremiah has introduced much of this prophecy of Isaiah into his own larger prophecy against the same people, (chap. 48.,) denouncing God\u2019s judgments on Moab, subsequent to the calamity here foretold, to be executed by Nebuchadnezzar.\u201d Bishop Lowth. <i>In the night<\/i>\u2014Or, <i>in a night,<\/i> suddenly and unexpectedly, <i>Ar of Moab is laid waste<\/i>\u2014The chief city of Moab, <a class=\"ref\">Numbers 21:28<\/a>. <i>Kir of Moab is laid waste<\/i>\u2014Another eminent city of Moab, called more largely and fully, Kir-hareseth and Kir-haresh, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3OTc3XQ==\">Isaiah 16:7<\/a>; <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3OTgxLDIwMTEyLDIwMTE3XQ==\">Isaiah 16:11; Jeremiah 48:31; Jeremiah 48:36<\/a>.<\/p> ",
