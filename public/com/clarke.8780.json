'Kings shall shut,' etc., is good, but seems to want a first part.\" - Secker. Munster translates it, <i>faciet loqui<\/i>, (<i>de se <\/i>); and in his note thus explains it: <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d9\u05d6\u05d4 <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, yazzeh <\/span> <i>proprie significat spargere et stillas disseminare; hic hero capitur pro loqui, et verbum disseminare<\/i>,. \" <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d9\u05d6\u05d4 <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, yazzeh<\/span>, properly signifies to sprinkle, and to scatter about drops; but it here means to speak, and to disseminate the word.\" This is pretty much as the Rabbins Kimchi and Sal. ben Belec explain it, referring to the expression of \"dropping the word.\" But the same objection lies to this as to the common rendering; it ought to be <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d2\u05d5\u05d9\u05dd \u05e2\u05dc<\/span>,(<span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d3\u05d1\u05e8 <\/span>) <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d9\u05d6\u05d4 <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, yazzeh<\/span>,(<span class=\"translit\">, debar <\/span>) <span class=\"translit\">, al goyim<\/span>,. Bishop Chandler, Defence, p. 148, says, \"that to sprinkle is used for to surprise and astonish, as people are that have much water thrown upon them. And this sense is followed by the Septuagint.\" This is ingenious, but rather too refined. Dr. Duress conjectures that the true reading may be <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d9\u05d4\u05d6\u05d5 <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, yechezu<\/span>, they shall regard, which comes near to the <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u03b8\u03b1\u03c5\u03bc\u03b1\u03c3\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9<\/span>, of the Septuagint, who seem to give the best sense of any to this place. <\/p>\n\n <p>\"I find in my papers the same conjecture which Dr. Durell made from <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u03b8\u03b1\u03c5\u03bc\u03b1\u03c3\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9<\/span>, in the Septuagint. And it may be added that <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d7\u05d6\u05d4 <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, chazah<\/span>, is used to express 'looking on any thing with admiration,' <a class=\"ref\">Psalm 11:7; Psalm 17:15; Psalm 27:4; Psalm 63:2; Song of Solomon 6:13<\/a>. It is particularly applied to 'looking on God,' <a class=\"ref\">Exodus 24:11<\/a>, and <a class=\"ref\">Job 19:26<\/a>. Gisbert Cuper, in Observ. lib. <a class=\"ref\">Job 2:1<\/a>, though treating on another subject, has some observations which show how nearly <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u03bf\u0314\u03c1\u03b1\u03c9<\/span>, and <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u03b8\u03b1\u03c5\u03bc\u03b1\u03b6\u03c9<\/span>, are allied, which, with the peculiar sense of the verb <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d7\u05d6\u05d4 <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, chazah<\/span>, above noted, add to the probability of <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u03b8\u03b1\u03c5\u03bc\u03b1\u03c3\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9<\/span>, being the version of <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d9\u05d7\u05d6\u05d5 <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, yechezu<\/span>, in the text: <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u03bf\u03b9\u0314 \u03b4\u03b5 \u03bd\u03c5 \u03bb\u03b1\u03bf\u03b9 \u03a0\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2 \u03b5\u03c2 \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03bf\u0314\u03c1\u03c9\u03c3\u03b9<\/span>,.
