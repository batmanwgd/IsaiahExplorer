    "html": " <p>&ldquo;On that day&rdquo; passages are generally appended to the text immediately preceding as commentary or as extending the horizon of the text into the future. This is not apparent in the present case, however. Duhm (1892, 189) concluded that <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODE1NCI6NH0=\">27:2&ndash;5<\/a>, must have been in the margin of the scroll and thence introduced accidently into the text, while Day suggested that dependence of <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODE0OCI6MTZ9\">26:17&ndash;27:11<\/a>, on <a class=\"ref\">Hos 13:13&ndash;14:10<\/a>, might explain its textual disconnectedness&mdash;though in fact the similarity is limited to <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTU4XQ==\">27:6<\/a>,(cf. <a class=\"ref\">Hos 14:6&ndash;8[5&ndash;7]<\/a>). The verb <em>pqd<\/em>, &ldquo;punish,&rdquo; of frequent occurrence in this section (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxNzkxOCwxODA5NV0seyIxODExNyI6Mn0sWzE4MTQ1LDE4MTQ3LDE4MTUyLDE4MTUzLDE4MTU1XV0=\">13:11; 23:17; 24:21, 22; 26:14, 16, 21; 27:1, 3<\/a>), provides a catchword link with the prediction of the punishment of Leviathan immediately preceding (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3Nzg0XQ==\">7:1<\/a>), but otherwise there is no overt connection. The passage opens with an invitation to the poet&rsquo;s audience to break into song about Yahweh&rsquo;s vineyard, rather like the invitation to sing about a well in <a class=\"ref\">Num 21:17<\/a>, in which the same verb (<em>\u02bfnh<\/em>, Piel) appears. Its inclusion could have been suggested by the &ldquo;song of the city&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTMyXQ==\">26:1<\/a>), and it does in fact serve in its context as another expression of Yahveh&rsquo;s concern for Israel&rsquo;s ultimate well-being, especially if the thorns and weeds refer metaphorically to prohibited cult practice (cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODE1OSI6N30=\">27:7&ndash;13<\/a>). Furthermore, the withdrawal of Yahveh&rsquo;s anger (<em>\u1e25\u0113m&acirc;<\/em>, here translated &ldquo;grudge&rdquo;) from his vineyard could <em>in context<\/em>, be referred back to the apocalyptic wrath (<em>za\u02bfam <\/em>) spoken of in the preceding poem (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTUxXQ==\">26:20<\/a>). <\/p> <p>It is hardly surprising that Israel as a whole or either Israel or Judah is often presented under the agricultural image of a vineyard (cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxNzY2MywxNzcyMl0seyIxNzY1NiI6MzF9XQ==\">1:8; 3:14;<\/a>, <a class=\"ref\">Hos 10:1; Jer 2:21; 5:10; 12:10&ndash;11; Ezek 15:1&ndash;5<\/a>), but the present passage is clearly meant to be read in relation to the song of the vineyard in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzc0MSI6N30=\">5:1&ndash;7<\/a>. The vineyard is flourishing (cf. the &ldquo;hillside rich in soil&rdquo;), Yahveh as vintner waters it sedulously&mdash;that is, Yahveh provides the rain denied earlier (perhaps a hint at the Garden of Eden here; <a class=\"ref\">Gen 2:5&ndash;6<\/a>), but the metaphor is left behind as he waits for <em>&scaron;\u0101l&ocirc;m<\/em>, &ldquo;a good relationship,&rdquo; rather than <em>mi&scaron;p\u0101\u1e6d &ucirc;\u1e63\u0115d\u0101q&acirc;<\/em>, &ldquo;justice and righteousness.&rdquo; &ldquo;Thorns and briers&rdquo; is a peculiarly Isaian topos (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxNzc2NF0seyIxNzgwNiI6Mn0sWzE3ODQ3LDE3ODY4XSx7IjE4MjcyIjoyfV0=\">5:24; 7:23&ndash;24; 9:17[18]; 10:17; 32:12&ndash;13<\/a>), one that could easily be taken to refer to foreign invaders or opponents in general, especially in view of the odd image of going out to battle against weeds and such&mdash;which Wildberger compares to dropping bombs on ants (1978, 582). Reasonably, therefore, Jacob (1970, 328) suggests a reference to the Samaritan opponents of Nehemiah, and Kaiser (1962, 225) identifies them as Samaritans <em>tout court<\/em>,. But in the vineyard song the thorns and weeds stand for the failure of the vineyard itself, an internal process of decay and degeneration, and this would seem to make the best fit here. In any case, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODE1NCI6NH0=\">27:2&ndash;5<\/a>, read as a radical revision or eschatological abrogation of <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzc0MSI6N30=\">5:1&ndash;7<\/a>, presents a theologically interesting case of development within the Isaian tradition. <\/p> <p>Rather than serving as introduction to <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODE1OSI6NX0=\">27:7&ndash;11<\/a>, with which it has nothing in common (pace the 1QIsa <sup> a<\/sup>, scribe, who left a space after <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTU3XQ==\">27:5<\/a>, and some other commentators), <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTU4XQ==\">27:6<\/a>, should be read as a further comment on <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODE1NCI6NH0=\">27:2&ndash;5<\/a>, using the same agricultural images of taking root, budding, blossoming, and extending the care of Yahweh for his plot into the distant future. <\/p> <p>Blenkinsopp, J.
