Vitringa supposes that Isaiah here refers to idols that were kept in private houses, as Uzziah and Jotham were worshippers of the true God, and in their reign idolatry was not publicly practiced. It is certain, however, that though Uzziah himself did right, and was disposed to worship the true God, yet he did not effectually remove idolatry from the land. The high places were not removed, and the people still sacrificed and burned incense on them;<a class=\"ref\">2 Kings 15:4<\/a> .

It is often brought as proof of their great folly and degradation that they paid homage to what &ldquo;they&rdquo; had themselves made.
