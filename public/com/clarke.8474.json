Deliverance and protection are, notwithstanding, promised, expressed by two similes; the first remarkably lofty and poetical, the latter singularly beautiful and tender,  <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MjU1XQ==\">Isaiah 31:4<\/a>,  <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MjU2XQ==\">Isaiah 31:5<\/a>. Exhortation to repentance, joined with the prediction of a more reformed period,  <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MjU3XQ==\">Isaiah 31:6<\/a>,  <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MjU4XQ==\">Isaiah 31:7<\/a>.
