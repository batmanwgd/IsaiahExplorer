Hence arises contempt of God and of all his threatenings; for punishments are not ascribed to the judgment of God, but to some fate and relation of things which they foolishly imagine. For this reason he kindles into such indignation against the Babylonians, and says that they shall be buming \u201cstubble,\u201d which is quickly consumed; for he does not compare them to wood, which is of some use for giving heat, but to \u201cstubble,\u201d in order to shew that nothing is so light or useless. <\/p>",
