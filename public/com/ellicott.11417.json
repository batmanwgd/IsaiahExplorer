The command is addressed to the prophets whom Isaiah contemplates as working towards the close of the exile, and carrying on his work. In <a class=\"ref\">Haggai 1:13, Haggai 2:9<\/a>, and <a class=\"ref\">Zechariah 1:13; Zechariah 2:5-10; Zechariah 9:9-12<\/a>, we may rightly trace the influence of the words as working out their own fulfilment. <\/p>\n <p>That her warfare is accomplished.\u2014The time of war, with all its suffering, becomes the symbol of sufferings apart from actual war. The exile was one long campaign with enemies who were worse than the Babylonian conquerors. In <a class=\"ref\">Job 7:1; Job 14:14<\/a>, the word is applied (rendered by \u201cappointed time\u201d) to the battle of life from its beginning to its end. This, too, may be noted as one of the many parallelisms between Isaiah and Job. <\/p>\n <p>That her iniquity is pardoned.\u2014Strictly, as in <a class=\"ref\">Leviticus 26:41; Leviticus 26:43<\/a>, is paid off, or accepted. The word implies not exemption from punishment, but the fact that the punishment had been accepted, and had done its work. <\/p>\n <p>She hath received of the Lord\u2019s hand . . .\u2014Primarily, the thought is that Jerusalem has suffered a more than sufficient penalty. (Comp. <a class=\"ref\">Exodus 22:9; Revelation 18:6<\/a>.) This seems more in harmony with the context than the view which takes the meaning that Jerusalem shall receive a double measure of grace and favour. In the long run, however, the one meaning does not exclude the other. It is the mercy of Jehovah which reckons the punishment sufficient, because it has been \u201caccepted\u201d (<a class=\"ref\">Leviticus 26:41<\/a>), and has done its work. (Comp. <a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 16:18<\/a>.) <\/p>",
