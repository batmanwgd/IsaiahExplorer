Whereby he implies that the generality of the Jews were guilty of gross infidelity and obstinate disobedience, and therefore might justly be rejected. <i>When I called<\/i> them to repentance and reformation, <i>there was none to come \u2014<\/i> None to come at my call, or to obey my commands. <i>Is my hand shortened at all,<\/i> &c.\u2014What is the reason of this contempt and rebellion? Is it because you expect no good from me, but think I am either unwilling or unable to save you?<i>Behold, at my rebuke I dry up the sea<\/i>\u2014At my word or command I can not only check its proud waves, but make its channel dry. Here, for a proof of his power, God appeals to the miracles he wrought in Egypt, at the Red sea, and at Jordan. <i>I make the rivers a wilderness<\/i>\u2014As dry and fit for travelling over as a wilderness. <i>I clothe the heavens with blackness<\/i>\u2014Or, <i>I will,<\/i> or<i>can clothe,<\/i> &c. What I once did in Egypt when I drew thick curtains before all the heavenly lights, and caused an unparalleled and amazing darkness to take place for three successive days, to the great terror of my enemies, so I can and will do still, when it is necessary to save my people. And therefore you have no reason to distrust me. <i>And I make sackcloth their covering<\/i>\u2014I cover them with clouds as black as sackcloth.<\/p> ",
