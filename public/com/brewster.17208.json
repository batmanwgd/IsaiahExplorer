However, it should be noted that there may be at least a dual fulfillment of this prophecy; there may be more than one servant to whom the prophecy applies. The message of this servant shall be brought forth in a day when the mighty of the earth shall consider that which they had previously not heard. According to Monte Nyman, such a condition is \"a sign of the Restoration [which] would be a day when kings would no longer hold absolute power but would be figureheads, with parliaments controlling the governments.\" (GAWI, 205.)<\/p>     <table>         <tbody>             <tr>                 <td>13 Behold, my servant shall deal prudently<u>,<\/u> he shall be exalted and extolled<u>,<\/u> and be very high.                     <br>                     <br>14 As many were <i>astonied<\/i> at thee<u>;<\/u> his visage was so marred more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men<u>:<\/u>                     <br>                     <br>15 So shall he sprinkle many nations; the kings shall shut their mouths at him<u>:<\/u> for that which had not been told them shall they see; and that which they had not heard shall they consider.                     <br>                 <\/td>                 <td>43 Behold, my servant shall deal prudently<u>;<\/u> he shall be exalted and extolled and be very high.                     <br>                     <br>44 As many were <i>astonished<\/i> at theehis visage was so marred<u>,<\/u> more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men                     <br>                     <br>45 So shall he sprinkle many nations; the kings shall shut their mouths at him<u>,<\/u> for that which had not been told them shall they see; and that which they had not heard shall they consider.                     <br>                     <br><i><a class=\"ref\">3 Nephi 21:8<\/a>.<\/i><u>And when that day shall come, it shall come to pass that<\/u> kings shall shut their mouths<u>;<\/u> for that which had not been told them shall they see; and that which they had not heard shall they consider.                     <br>                 <\/td>             <\/tr>         <\/tbody>     <\/table>",
