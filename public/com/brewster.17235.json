    "html": "<p><b>(<a class=\"ref\">Mosiah 14:10<\/a>).<\/b>\"<i>It pleased the Lord to bruise him.<\/i>\" Our Father in Heaven was not pleased with the treatment His Son received at the hands of wicked men, but He was pleased with His Son's willingness to obediently fulfill the great atoning sacrifice. (See \"smitten of God\" commentary on 53:4; see also <a class=\"ref\">John 3:16-17<\/a>.)<\/p>     <p>As a side note, Sidney Sperry observed that there is some difficulty with a literal translation of this verse, as it appears both in the Bible and the Book of Mormon, because it implies that \"it pleased Jehovah to bruise Jehovah.\" Dr. Sperry suggests that it is possible that the original text of Isaiah was improperly copied on the Brass Plates as well as in later texts from which the Bible was translated. In the original it should have read \"it pleased Elohim (God) to bruise Jehovah (Lord).\" In any event, the scriptures make clear that Jesus (Jehovah) acts with full authority for His Father and the two act in unity, in total accord.
