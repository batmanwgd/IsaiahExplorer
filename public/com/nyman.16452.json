In fact, Isaiah mentions the scourge twice (verses 15 and 18), which may also indicate two different time periods. Of course, the Lord has sent and will yet send many scourges upon the earth. The Prophet Joseph Smith identified one of these: \"The servants of God will not have gone over the nations of the Gentiles, with a warning voice, until the <i>destroying<\/i> angel will commence to waste the inhabitants of the earth, and as the prophet [Isaiah] hath said, 'It shall be a vexation to hear the report'\" (TPJS, p. 87).<\/p>     ",
