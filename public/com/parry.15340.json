Those of us who attain to Zion will \"be glad,\" \"rejoice,\" and \"rejoice even with joy and singing\"; there will be \"songs and everlasting joy upon\" our heads. We will \"obtain joy and gladness,\" and \"sorrow and sighing\" shall \"flee away\" from us. Most important, as we are obedient and worthy, we will \"see the glory of the Lord, and the excellency of our God.\"<\/i><\/p> ",
