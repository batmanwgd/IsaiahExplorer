Many interpret the beasts as the surrounding nations, and the watchmen and dogs as the leaders of Israel who are not protecting their flock but are asleep. However, the context of the preceding and the following verses points to the gentile nations whose hearts and minds are turned to material things, and who depend on their own intellects rather than the higher thoughts and ways of the Lord. The majority of the Gentiles will reject the gospel (see <a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 45:29<\/a>) and continue in their ignorant and wicked ways.<\/p>     ",
