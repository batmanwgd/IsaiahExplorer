    "html": " <p>This poem in its present position is a response to the prayer which precedes it; but this connection is very probably due to an editor rather than to the author or authors of the prophecies. Yahweh is the speaker, and he contrasts his own availability to the failure of Israel to &ldquo;seek&rdquo; him. Indeed, it is rather Yahweh who has sought Israel and has not found it. The interest of the poem is entirely cultic; Israel has not sought Yahweh because it has substituted superstitious cults for the rites of Yahweh. The rites mentioned are obscure and cannot be identified with any cultic practices of the period known to us; see Note on vs. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4OTAxXQ==\">3 <\/a>. The eating of pork is very probably more than a violation of the dietary laws; it was the use of the pig in a sacrificial cult which was obviously foreign. The idea of ritual holiness that could be communicated by contact was not unique with the Israelites; but the use of the word &ldquo;holy,&rdquo; a word of such religious weight in the OT, to describe superstitious rites is a kind of blasphemy which arouses indignation. Yahweh was &ldquo;the Holy One of Israel&rdquo; in First Isaiah and Second Isaiah. Verse <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4OTA1XQ==\">7 <\/a> seems to specify &ldquo;the crimes of the fathers&rdquo;; it emphasizes practices mentioned in pre-exilic literature. Cultic interest is not characteristic of Second Isaiah. <\/p> <p>McKenzie, J. L. (2008). <em>Second Isaiah: Introduction, Translation, and Notes <\/em> (Vol. 20, p. 195).
