He is described in them as son of Yakin, but this is, probably, a dynastic appellative, just as Jehu is described in the Assyrian records (Records of the Past, v. 41) as \u201cthe son of Khumri\u201d (i.e., Omri). The mission had two ostensible objects: (1) congratulation on Hezekiah\u2019s recovery; (2) to inquire and report as to the phenomenon of the sun-dial ( <a class=\"ref\">2 Chronicles 32:31<\/a>). Really, we may believe the object of Mer\u00f4dach-baladan was to open negotiations for an alliance with Judah. The \u201cpresent,\u201d interpreted after the manner of the East, would seem almost like an acknowledgment of Hezekiah\u2019s hegemony, or even suzerainty, in such a confederacy.<\/p> ",
