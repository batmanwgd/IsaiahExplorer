    "html": "<p>Being &ldquo;followers of ashes&rdquo; implies dependence on what is fated to disappear&mdash;on what Jehovah reduces to chaos in his Day of Judgment. And yet, so powerful a hold has idolatry on its adherents that they grow incapable of perceiving anything besides what their spiritually altered state limits them to. Instead of being reborn and re-created on ever higher spiritual levels, they are de-created and descend, losing even their reasoning powers as they enter into spiritual bondage to a &ldquo;fraud&rdquo; or &ldquo;lie&rdquo; (<em>seqer<\/em>). At that point, only Jehovah, their Redeemer, can liberate them, on condition they turn to him (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">vv 21-22<\/a>).<\/p>",
