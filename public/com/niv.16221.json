Many different proposals have been put forward, ranging from the argument that there is no structure at all to complex parallelisms. What this tells us is that the material is complex and that any proposal must be presented with diffidence. The prophet\u2019s method of presentation in these chapters seems to be the repetition of key themes in varying ways with a certain degree of increasing specificity. Then chapter 47 draws the conclusions of what has been said as regards Babylon, and chapter 48 is a call to trust and belief.<\/p>     <p>\u2003One feature that many commentators have noted and have taken as structural indicators are the hymnic portions in 42:10\u201313 and 44:23. They understand these segments to bring a previous unit to a close and to introduce a new one. But those who see the material in this way do not agree as to whether these segments should be treated as the closing of the previous unit or the opening of the succeeding one. This subtlety of transition as a feature of the book has been noted several times above. I consider them to be the opening of the succeeding unit and so see the structure as 41:1\u201342:9; 42:10\u201344:22; and 44:23\u201347:15.<\/p>     <p>\u2003Within 41:1\u201342:9, we can identify two subsections, each beginning with a challenge to the idol worshipers to present their best case that their gods are truly divine. (1) Isaiah 41:1\u201320 speaks of the terror that God\u2019s activities are inducing among the idol worshipers (vv. 2\u20137) but goes on to assure his servant Israel that they need not be afraid (vv. 8\u201320). (2) Isaiah 41:21\u201342:9 begins with a strong argument for God\u2019s superiority over the idols because he alone has foretold the future (41:21\u201329) and concludes by introducing the ideal Servant, through whom God will bring justice on the earth (42:1\u20139).<\/p>     ",
