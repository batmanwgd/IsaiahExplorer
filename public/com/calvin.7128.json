    "html": "<p><i>And I will set the Egyptians against the Egyptians. <\/i>Here he describes more particularly the calamity which the Lord had determined to bring on Egypt. By the expression, <i>I will set, <\/i>he means the internal struggles, in which those who ought to be mutual defenders cut down one another; and no evil can be more destructive than this to a state or a people. It was of importance also to convince the Jews that God, in whose hands are the hearts of men, (<a class=\"ref\">Proverbs 21:1<\/a>,) could by his unseen influence inflame the Jews to mutual animosities, that they might slay each other, though they were victorious over foreign enemies. Hence we learn that nations never rise in a seditious manner, unless the Lord <i>set them <\/i>against each other, as when one brings forward gladiators to the place of combat. He inflames their minds for battle, and prompts them to slay each other by mutual wounds; and therefore, as we ought to reckon it an evidence of God\u2019s favor, when friendship is cherished among citizens, so we ought to ascribe it to his vengeance, when they rage against and slay and injure one another. <\/p>\n<p><i>And they shall fight every one against his brother. <\/i>For the sake of heightening the picture, he adds what was still more monstrous, that those who were related to them by blood would take up arms to destroy each other; for if men are worse than beasts when, forgetting their common nature, they engage in battle, how much more shocking is it to nature that brethren or allies should fight with each other! But the more monstrous it is, the more ought we to acknowledge the judgment of God and his terrible vengeance. <\/p>\n<p><i>City against city, and kingdom against kingdom. <\/i>Isaiah appears to advance by degrees; for he mentions, first, <i>a brother; <\/i>secondly, <i>a neighbor; <\/i>thirdly, <i>cities; <\/i>and, fourthly, <i>kingdoms <\/i>By <i>kingdoms <\/i>he means <i>provinces, <\/i>into which Egypt was divided, which the Greeks called  <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03bf\u1f30<\/span>, the term by which the Greek translators have rendered it in this passage.  <\/p>\n\n<p>FT284 \u201cAnd the spirit of Egypt shall fail. Heb. <i>shall be emptied. <\/i>\u201d \u2014 Eng. Ver. <\/p>\n<p>FT285 \u201cAnd the Egyptians will I give over, <i>or, shut up. <\/i>\u201d \u2014 Eng. Ver. \u201cAnd I will shut up Egypt in the hand of cruel lords.\u201d \u2014 <i>Stock. <\/i><\/p>\n<p>FT286 \u201cA fierce king.\u201d \u2014 Eng. Ver. <\/p>\n<p>FT287 See vol. 1 p. 266 <\/p>\n<p>FT288 \u201c<i>Embanked canals. <\/i><span class=\"aramaic_text\">Rivi aggerum<\/span>, as the Vulgate has it. The canals by which the waters of the Nile were distributed were fortified by mounds or banks.  <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05de\u05e6\u05d5\u05e8<\/span>, (<i>m\u0101tz\u014dr,<\/i>) which word Rosenm\u00fcller vainly endeavors to shew to be another name for Egypt or Mizraim.\u201d \u2014 <i>Stock. <\/i><\/p>\n<p>FT289 See vol. 1 p. 492 <\/p>\n<p>FT290 \u201cAnd ashamed (disappointed or confounded) are the workers of combed (or hatchelled) flax, and the weavers of white (stuffs.) The older writers supposed the class of persons here described to be the manufacturers of nets for fishing, and took  <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d4\u05d5\u05e8\u05d9<\/span>, (<i>h\u014drai,<\/i>) in the sense of perforated open work or net-work. The moderns understand the verse as having reference to the working of flax and manufacture of linen. Knobel supposes  <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d4\u05d5\u05e8\u05d9<\/span>, (<i>h\u014drai,<\/i>) to mean <i>cotton, <\/i>as being white by nature, and before it is wrought. Some of the older writers identified  <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05e9\u05e8\u05d9\u05e7\u05d5\u05ea<\/span>, (<i>s\u0115r\u012bk\u014dth<\/i>,) with <i>sericum <\/i> <i>, <\/i>the Latin word for silk. Calvin supposes an allusion in the last clause to the diaphanous garments of luxurious women.\u201d \u2014 <i>Professor Alexander. <\/i><\/p>\n<p>FT291 Our author is puzzled about this word. In his version he follows the old rendering, \u201call that make a net,\u201d but his marginal reading is \u201call that make gain,\u201d and to the latter he adheres in his commentary. Bishops Lowth and Stock render it, \u201call that make a gain,\u201d and Professor Alexander, \u201call laborers for hire.\u201d \u2014 <i>Ed. <\/i><\/p>\n<p>FT292  <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05e7\u05e8\u05dd<\/span>, (<i>k\u0115d\u0115m,<\/i>) has two meanings, \u201cantiquity\u201d and \u201cthe east;\u201d and accordingly Bishop Stock renders this clause, \u201cthe son of the kings of the east,\u201d adding the following note: \u2014 \u201c<i>Kings of the east. <\/i>A synonyme for <i>wise men, <\/i> <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u03bc\u1f71\u03b3\u03bf\u03b9 \u1f00\u03c0\u1f78 \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03bb\u1ff6\u03bd<\/span>, the quarter of the world where the arts of divination originated, and to whose sovereigns Egyptian sages pretended kindred. Hence the magi, that came to worship Christ, are often denominated <i>the three kings. <\/i>\u201d \u2014 <i>Ed. <\/i><\/p>\n<p>FT293 \u201cZoan, the Tanis of the Greeks, was one of the most ancient cities of Lower Egypt, (<a class=\"ref\">Numbers 13:22<\/a>,) and a royal residence. The name is of Egyptian origin, and signifies low situation. <i>Noph <\/i>is the Memphis of the Greek geographers, called Moph, (<a class=\"ref\">Hosea 9:6<\/a>.) It was one of the chief cities of ancient Egypt, the royal seat of Psammetichus.\u201d \u2014 <i>Alexander. <\/i><\/p>\n<p>FT294 \u201cThe stay (Heb., corners) of the tribes thereof.\u201d \u2014 Eng. Ver. <\/p>\n<p>FT295 Instead of  <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05e4\u05e0\u05ea<\/span>, (<i>pinn\u0103th,<\/i>) the construct singular, Grotius, Lowth, and others, prefer the conjectural reading,  <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05e4\u05e0\u05d5\u05ea<\/span> (<i>pinn\u014dth,<\/i>) <i>corners. <\/i>But Rosenm\u00fcller removes the difficulty of the Syntax by remarking, that  <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05e4\u05e0\u05d4<\/span>, (<i>pinn\u0101h,<\/i>) a collective noun, and agreeably to the frequent usage of the Hebrew tongue, fitly agrees with a plural verb; and he quotes <a class=\"ref\">2 Samuel 19:41<\/a>, as a parallel instance. \u2014 <i>Ed. <\/i><\/p>\n<p>FT296 Professor Alexander prefers the literal rendering, \u201cfrom before the shaking of the hand,\u201d and thus explains the passage: \u201c <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05de\u05e4\u05e0\u05d9<\/span>, (<i>mipp\u0115n\u0113<\/i>,) may be rendered, <i>on account of<\/i>, which idea is certainly included, but the true force of the original expression is best retained by a literal translation.  <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05ea\u05e0\u05d5\u05e4\u05ea \u05d9\u05d3<\/span>, (<i>t\u0115n\u016bph\u0103th y\u0103d<\/i>,) is not the act of beckoning for the enemy, but that of threatening or preparing to strike. The reference is not to the slaughter of Sennacherib\u2019s army, but more generally to the indications of Divine displeasure.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>FT297 The only passage which occurs to my remembrance as likely to be in the author\u2019s eye is, \u201cAnd thou shalt become an astonishment, a proverb and a bye-word, among all the nations whither the Lord shall lead thee.\u201d (<a class=\"ref\">Deuteronomy 28:37<\/a>.) \u2014 <i>Ed. <\/i><\/p>\n<p>FT298 <i>Heliopolis <\/i>is a Greek word, and signifies \u201cthe city of the sun.\u201d It is the name of a famous city of Lower Egypt, in which there was a temple dedicated to the sun. \u2014 <i>Ed. <\/i><\/p>\n<p>FT299 \u201c<i>Pillar<\/i>. \u201d \u2014 Eng. Ver. <\/p>\n<p>FT300 The name \u201cPhilom\u0113tor,\u201d which means \u201cloving his mother,\u201d was ironically given to him on account of his known hatred of his mother Cleopatra. \u2014 <i>Ed <\/i><\/p>\n<p>FT301 \u201c<span class=\"aramaic_text\">Sous ceste pedagogie de la Loy<\/span>.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>FT302 \u201c<span class=\"aramaic_text\">Les signes et sacramens<\/span>.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>FT303 Of one clause in this verse, rendered by our translators \u201cand a great one,\u201d Calvin takes no notice. Rosenm\u00fcller considers  <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05e8\u05d1<\/span> (<i>r\u0101b<\/i>) to be the participle Kal of  <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05e8\u05d5\u05d1<\/span>, (<i>r\u016bb<\/i>,) and assigns to Cocceius the honor of having discovered that the punctuation, which the Masoretic annotators have set aside, in the parallel passage of Deuteronomy, as a peculiarity for which they could not account, was the key to the true interpretation. Almost all the commentators, Cocceius excepted, render  <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05e8\u05d1<\/span> (<i>r\u0101b<\/i>) \u201ca great one,\u201d some of them supposing that Ptolemy the Great, the son of Lagus, and others that Alexander the Great, was meant. But Cocceius was the first to perceive that the signification \u201cGreat\u201d does not agree with the context, and has justly remarked that the word  <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05e8\u05d1<\/span> (<i>r\u0101b<\/i>) with a Kametz, ought not to be confounded with  <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05e8\u05d1<\/span> (<i>r\u0101b<\/i>,) with a Pathach, but that its meaning should be sought from the verb  <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05e8\u05d5\u05d1<\/span> (<i>r\u016bb<\/i>) or  <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05e8\u05d9\u05d1<\/span> (<i>r\u012bb<\/i>,) \u201cto contend, to argue, to defend one\u2019s cause in a court of justice;\u201d and he quotes a parallel passage, in which Moses, while he blesses Judah, speaking of God, says,  <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d9\u05d3\u05d9\u05d5 \u05e8\u05d1 \u05dc\u05d5<\/span> (<i>y\u0101daiv r\u0101b l\u014d<\/i>) \u201chis hands shall be his protector.\u201d (<a class=\"ref\">Deuteronomy 33:7<\/a>.) See Robertson\u2019s Clavis Pentateuchi, p. 561. The ancients appear to have taken a similar view. The Septuagint renders it thus.  <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u039a\u03b1\u1f76 \u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u1fd6 \u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u03bf\u1fd6\u03c2 \u1f04\u03bd\u03b8\u03c1\u03c9\u03c0\u03bf\u03bd \u1f43\u03c2 \u03c3\u1f7d\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9 \u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u03bf\u1f7a\u03c2, \u03ba\u03c1\u1f77\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd \u03c3\u1f7d\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9 \u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u03bf\u1f7b\u03c2<\/span>. The Chaldee and Syriac render it, \u201ca deliverer and a judge,\u201d and Jerome\u2019s rendering is, <i>propuqnatorem <\/i>, \u201ca defender or champion\u201d. Rosenm\u00fcller Scholia. \u201cA Savior and a vindicator\u201d. Lowth. \u201cAn advocate\u201d. Stock. \u201cThe explanation of  <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05e8\u05d1<\/span>, (<i>rab<\/i>) as a participle,\u201d says Professor Alexander, \u201cis found in all the ancient versions, and is adopted by most modern writers.\u201d \u2014 <i>Ed. <\/i><\/p>\n<p>FT304 The words of the Apostle are, \u201cHow shall they call on him in whom they have not <i>believed? <\/i>\u201d But Calvin\u2019s remark, which immediately follows, vindicates the appropriateness, though not the verbal accuracy, of the quotation. \u2014 <i>Ed. <\/i><\/p>\n<p>FT305 \u201c<span class=\"aramaic_text\">La doctrine de salut<\/span>;\u201d \u201cThe doctrine of salvation.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>FT306 \u201c<span class=\"aramaic_text\">Ce sera un preparatif pour les amener \u00e0 repentance<\/span>;\u201d \u2014 \u201cIt will be a preparation to lead them to repentance.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>FT307 \u201c<span class=\"aramaic_text\">Pourvenu que notre repentance ne soit hypocritique<\/span>;\u201d \u2014 \u201cProvided that our repentance be not hypocritical.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>FT308 \u201c<span class=\"aramaic_text\">D\u2019o\u00f9 viennent les chastimens, si non de nos pechez?

See p. 48 <\/p>\n<p>FT311 The particle  <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d0\u05ea<\/span> (\u0115<i>th<\/i>) does not decide the question, for it may either be the sign of the accusative case, or a preposition signifying <i>with<\/i>. Professor Alexander adopts the latter view, and argues powerfully in favor of the rendering, \u201cthey shall serve God,\u201d in which he concurs with Lowth, \u201cAnd the Egyptian shall worship with the Assyrian,\u201d and with Stock, \u201cAnd Egypt shall serve [God] with Assyria.\u201d \u2014 <i>Ed. <\/i><\/p>\n<p>FT312 \u201c<span class=\"aramaic_text\">De la crainte de Dieu<\/span>,\u201d \u2014 \u201cfrom the fear of God.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>FT313 \u201cJacob is the lot (Heb. cord) of his inheritance.\u201d \u2014 Eng. Ver. <\/p>\n<p>FT314 \u201cThe meaning obviously is,\u201d says Professor Alexander, \u201cthat Israel should be one of three, or a party to a triple union.\u201d By an analagous idiom of the Greek language, Peter calls Noah  <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u1f44\u03b3\u03b4\u03bf\u03bf\u03bd<\/span>, \u201cthe eighth,\u201d that is, \u201cone of eight persons.\u201d (<a class=\"ref\">2 Peter 2:5<\/a>.)
