Cut off from Jehovah&rsquo;s presence, they are made to realize that without him there is no access to any other saving power (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 43:11<\/a>). Their only recourse is to complete the entire repentance process until he revives and heals them (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 57:15-16<\/a>; cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzgwXQ==\">6:10<\/a>). The <em>hand<\/em> of Jehovah that might have delivered them, they rejected, so that now they feel his <em>hand<\/em> of punishment (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 50:2, 10-11<\/a>). Although he called them, they still mostly wallow in spiritual inertia (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 43:22<\/a>).<\/p>",
