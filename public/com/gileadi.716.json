Cut off from Jehovah&rsquo;s presence, they are made to realize that without him there is no access to any other saving power (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTg1MTc=\">Isaiah 43:11<\/a>). Their only recourse is to complete the entire repentance process until he revives and heals them (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODc4MSI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 57:15-16<\/a>; cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTc3ODA=\">6:10<\/a>). The <em>hand<\/em> of Jehovah that might have delivered them, they rejected, so that now they feel his <em>hand<\/em> of punishment (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3sic2luZ2xlcyI6WzE4NjY1XX0seyIxODY3MyI6Mn1d\">Isaiah 50:2, 10-11<\/a>). Although he called them, they still mostly wallow in spiritual inertia (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTg1Mjg=\">Isaiah 43:22<\/a>).<\/p>",
