    "html": "<p> As a documentary proof of this third account, a psalm of Hezekiah is added in the text of Isaiah, in which he celebrates his miraculous rescue from the brink of death. The author of the book of Kings has omitted it; but the genuineness is undoubted. The heading runs thus in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDAwXQ==\">Isaiah 38:9<\/a> : <em> \u201cWriting of Hizkiyahu king of Judah, when he was sick, and recovered from his sickness.\u201d<\/em> The song which follows might be headed <em> Mikhtam <\/em> , since it has the characteristics of this description of psalm (see at <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 16:1<\/a>). We cannot infer from <em> bacha\u0306lo\u0304tho\u0304 <\/em> (when he was sick) that it was composed by Hezekiah during his illness (see at <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 51:1<\/a>); <em> vayyechi <\/em> (and he recovered) stamps it as a song of thanksgiving, composed by him after his recovery. In common with the two Ezrahitish psalms, Ps 88 and 89, it has not only a considerable number of echoes of the book of Job, but also a lofty sweep, which is rather forced than lyrically direct, and appears to aim at copying the best models.<\/p>",
