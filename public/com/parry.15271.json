When the Lord becomes our ruler, he will remove evil people from our society, including those who use obscene language, are hypocritical, and attempt to destroy the faith of others.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>Already we see the Spirit of the Lord being poured out upon us, the result being a great increase in the fruits and produce of the earth. More important, we may experience greater personal peace and righteousness because of our acceptance of Jesus Christ and his commandments and because of the gifts and powers of the Holy Ghost.<\/i><\/p> ",
