(<a class=\"ref\">Leviticus 26:10 <\/a>.) On the other hand, the disobedient shall be expelled from the houses which they built, and shall give place to foreigners, and shall be deprived of the fruits of the trees which they planted. \u201cThe Lord,\u201d saith Isaiah, \u201cshall protect you from that curse, so as to enjoy your property.\u201d Now the Prophets hold out those things which relate to the present life, and borrow metaphors from them; but it is in order that they may teach us to rise higher and to embrace eternal and blessed life. We must not fix our whole attention on these transitory blessings, but must make use of them as ladders, that, being raised to heaven, we may enjoy eternal and immortal blessings. To the Church, which has been renewed, and which rests on nothing but God\u2019s good pleasure and undeserved favor, is justly promised the enjoyment of those blessings of which unbelievers had deprived themselves. <\/p> ",
