This divine prescience and predicting of future events is thus repeatedly insisted upon, because it is the principal argument used here, and in chap. 41., to determine this controversy between Jehovah and idols. <i>Yea, before the day was<\/i>\u2014Before all time: or, which is the same, from all eternity. <i>I am he<\/i>\u2014I am God, and have proved myself to be so. <i>None can deliver out of my hands<\/i>\u2014None of those that are called gods can save them whom I will destroy. Therefore they are impotent, and consequently no gods. <i>I will work, and who shall let it?<\/i>\u2014Nor can they hinder me in any other work which I resolve to do.<\/p> ",
