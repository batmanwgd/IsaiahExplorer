(NIV)<\/p> <p>D. Jacob becomes thin.<\/p> <p>E. A harvesting takes place.<\/p> <p>F. Only a little fruit (Israelites) remains on the branches.<\/p> <\/blockquote><p>The Valley of Rephaim spoken of in verse 5 is a fertile vale northwest of Jerusalem noted for harvests so fruitful that it was the camping place and grazing area for the Philistine armies as they attacked Israel during the days of Saul and David. (See <a class=\"ref\">2 Sam. 5:18, 22; 23:13<\/a>.)<\/p> <p>The warning to Jacob in verse 4 parallels the earlier one to Damascus, in that both warnings include four similar elements:<\/p> <p><sup>1<\/sup> The head will be weakened (Damascus, Jacob).<\/p> <p><sup>2<\/sup> The people will be destroyed.<\/p> <p><sup>3<\/sup> Only a remnant will remain.<\/p> <p><sup>4<\/sup> Thus declares the Lord!<\/p>",
