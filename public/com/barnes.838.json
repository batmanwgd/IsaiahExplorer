    "html": "<p><em>Go to<\/em> &mdash;The Hebrew word here is one that is commonly rendered, &lsquo;I pray you,&rsquo; and is used &ldquo;to call the attention to&rdquo; what is said. It is the word from which we have derived the adverb &ldquo;now,&rdquo; \u05e0\u05d0 na\u0304&rsquo;.<\/p><p><em>I will take away the hedge<\/em> &mdash;A &ldquo;hedge&rdquo; is a fence of thorns, made by suffering thorn-bushes to grow so thick that nothing can pass through them. Here it means that God would withdraw his protection from the Jews, and leave them exposed to be overrun and trodden down by their enemies, as a vineyard would be by wild beasts if it were not protected.<\/p><p><em>The wall...<\/em> &mdash;Vineyards, it seems, had a &ldquo;double&rdquo; enclosure.&mdash;&ldquo;Gesenius.&rdquo; Such a double protection might be necessary, as some animals might scale a wall that would yet find it impossible to pass through a thorn-hedge. The sense here is, that though the Jews had been protected in every way possible, yet that protection would be withdrawn, and they would be left defenseless.<\/p> ",
