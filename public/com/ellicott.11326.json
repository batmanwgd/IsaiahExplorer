    "html": "<p> (5) My sword shall be bathed in heaven . . .\u2014Literally, hath drunk to the full. The words find an echo in <a class=\"ref\">Deuteronomy 32:41-42<\/a> , and <a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 46:10<\/a>. There, however, the sword is soaked, or made drunk with blood. Here it is \u201cbathed in heaven,\u201d and this seems to require a different meaning. We read in Greek poets, of the \u201cdippings\u201d by which steel was tempered. May not the \u201cbathing\u201d of Isaiah have a like significance?<\/p> \n<p>It shall come down upon Idumea . . .\u2014Better, for Edom, . . . here and in the next verse. No reason can be assigned for this exceptional introduction of the Greek form.<\/p> ",
