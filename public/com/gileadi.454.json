That creation accords with a divine &ldquo;plan&rdquo; or &ldquo;counsel&rdquo; (<em>&lsquo;asato<\/em>) concerning God&rsquo;s children, as becomes clear from chapter 40&rsquo;s progressively narrowing concept of creation. While man often seeks to counsel God (cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc3NTkiOjF9LHsiMTg1NzEiOjF9LHsiMTg5MjgiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 5:19; 45:9; 66:5<\/a>), he should instead take counsel <em>from<\/em> God and learn his plan. Man&rsquo;s &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo; is limited to his own experience, his &ldquo;way of understanding&rdquo; being vastly inferior to Jehovah&rsquo;s (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc3NzkiOjF9LHsiMTgyMDgiOjJ9LHsiMTg3NDkiOjJ9XQ==\">Isaiah 6:9; 29:14, 24; 55:8-9<\/a>).<\/p>",
