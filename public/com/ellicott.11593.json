The context leaves it uncertain whether the \u201cpleasure\u201d and the \u201carm\u201d are those of Cyrus or Jehovah. The latter seems to give a preferable meaning. There is, perhaps, an allusive reference to the idea implied in the name of the great king of Israel (David, \u201cbeloved,\u201d or \u201cdarling\u201d). Cyrus was to be even as a second David, beloved of the Lord.<\/p>",
