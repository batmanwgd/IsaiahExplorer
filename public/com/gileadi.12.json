    "html": " <p>Although Jehovah had commanded the offering of incense (<a class=\"ref\">Exodus 30:1-8; 40:26-27 <\/a>)&mdash;symbolic of the prayers of the righteous ascending to his presence (<a class=\"ref\">Psalm 141:2; Revelation 8:3-4 <\/a>)&mdash;the idea of a &ldquo;loathsome incense&rdquo; likens it to a nauseating odor. Their sacrifices have become &ldquo;worthless&rdquo; because they aren&rsquo;t backed up by personal righteousness (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODUyXQ==\">Isaiah 61:8 <\/a>). Even their religious meetings and assemblies Jehovah can&rsquo;t approve because those who attend them are encumbered with offenses. Their wickedness&mdash;their unrepented sins and iniquities&mdash;turns their services into solemn mockery. <\/p> ",
