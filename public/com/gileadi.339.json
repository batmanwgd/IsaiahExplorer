Those who were &ldquo;blind&rdquo; and &ldquo;deaf&rdquo;&mdash;his covenant people (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg0OTciOjV9LFsxODUxNF1d\">Isaiah 42:16-20; 43:8<\/a>)&mdash;then &ldquo;see&rdquo; and &ldquo;hear&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgyNjMiOjJ9LFsxODMyNl1d\">Isaiah 32:3-4; 35:5<\/a>). Having formerly &ldquo;put darkness for light and light for darkness&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzYwXQ==\">Isaiah 5:20<\/a>), they then &ldquo;see with their eyes and hear with their ears&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzgwXQ==\">Isaiah 6:10<\/a>). When Jehovah appoints his servant as &ldquo;a light to the nations&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;to open eyes that are blind&rdquo; and to deliver &ldquo;those in darkness&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDg4LDE4NjQzLDE4NjQ2XQ==\">Isaiah 42:7; 49:6, 9<\/a>; cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODMyXQ==\">9:2<\/a>)&mdash;humanity&rsquo;s poor and lowly rejoice in Israel&rsquo;s Holy One. <\/p> ",
