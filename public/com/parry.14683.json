For instance, God appeared at the Sinai sanctuary (<a class=\"ref\">Ex. 15:17<\/a>) and was accompanied by a cloud, smoke, fire (<a class=\"ref\">Ex. 19:9,  18<\/a>), and similar elements associated with Solomon's temple (<a class=\"ref\">1 Kgs. 8:10<\/a>) and the temple in heaven (6:4; <a class=\"ref\">Rev. 15:8<\/a>). The cloud symbolizes the Lord's glory (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 84:2-5<\/a>). The people of the latter-day Zion will be so righteous that they will all enjoy such blessings.<\/p> <p><i>shall be a defence.<\/i> The word <i>defence<\/i> should read \"canopy\" or \"protective covering.\" Hence Zion and her inhabitants will be protected by God from spiritual harm in the same way that individuals are protected from physical harm by seeking shelter during the heat of the day or in great storms (4:6).<\/p> ",
