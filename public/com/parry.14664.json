    "html": " <i>countenance.<\/i> One's facial expression, or <i>countenance,<\/i> possesses either the light and spirit of the gospel or the darkness that signifies evil. For instance, an angel's countenance is described as being \"as lightning\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 20:6<\/a>; see also <a class=\"ref\">JS-H 1:32<\/a>), and Jesus' countenance possesses light (<a class=\"ref\">3 Ne. 19:25<\/a>). On the other hand, Cain (<a class=\"ref\">Gen. 4:5-6<\/a>), and at times hypocrites, have a fallen or \"sad countenance\" (<a class=\"ref\">3 Ne. 13:16<\/a>). <\/p> <p> <i>Sodom.<\/i> Sodom and Gomorrah are perfect examples of wicked communities. Their inhabitants committed a variety of sexual sins, and they also failed to care for the needy and oppressed (<a class=\"ref\">Ezek. 16:49<\/a>). <\/p> <p><i>they cannot hide it.<\/i> The wicked cannot hide their wickedness from God because he \"knoweth all things, and there is not anything save he knows it\" (<a class=\"ref\">2 Ne. 9:20<\/a>) God also[\"know[s] all their works\" (<a class=\"ref\">2 Ne. 27:27<\/a>). <\/p> <p><i>Woe.<\/i> The two <i>woes <\/i>(3:9, 11) indicate the trouble, sorrow, or affliction that will come on the wicked. The term <i>woe<\/i> is found twenty-two times in Isaiah.<\/p> <p><i>rewarded evil unto themselves.<\/i> A better translation is provided by the New International Version: \"They have brought disaster upon themselves.\"<\/p> ",
