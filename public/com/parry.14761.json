    "html": " <p>The sign provided to Ahaz was first fulfilled with the union of Isaiah and his wife and the birth of their son Maher-shalal-hash-baz (see commentary on 7:14-16). At least nine months would have passed since the conditions of the sign were given to Ahaz, for the text makes it clear that Isaiah \"went unto the prophetess\" after the pronouncement of the sign (8:3). Similar language found in 7:14-16 and 8:2-4 makes it clear that 8:2-4 is the first and immediate fulfillment of the Immanuel prophecy given in 7:14-16 (see Table 1, page 73). The verses recording the first fulfillment of this prophecy are written in prose rather than in the poetic parallelistic style.<\/p> <blockquote>Moreover the [word of the] Lord said unto me, Take thee a great [tablet], and     <br>write in it with a man's pen concerning Maher-shalal-hash-baz. (8:1) And I took unto me faithful witnesses to record, Uriah the priest, and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah. (8:2) And I went unto the prophetess; and she conceived, and bare a son. Then said the Lord to me, Call his name Maher-shalal-hash-baz. (8:3) For [behold,] the child shall [not] have knowledge to cry, My father, and my mother, before the riches of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria shall be taken away before the king of Assyria.
