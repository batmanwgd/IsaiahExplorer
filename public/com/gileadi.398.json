Jehovah&rsquo;s <em>mouth <\/em>&mdash;his servant&mdash;&ldquo;decrees&rdquo; or &ldquo;ordains&rdquo; (<em>siwwa<\/em>) it, while Jehovah&rsquo;s Spirit brings them together so that they find one another. Jehovah&rsquo;s <em>hand <\/em>&mdash;his servant&mdash;assigns them permanent inheritances in the land, as did Joshua: &ldquo;I have created you and appointed you to be a covenant of the people, to restore the Land and reapportion the desolate estates&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NjQ1XQ==\">Isaiah 49:8<\/a>; cf. <a class=\"ref\">Joshua 11:23<\/a>). Unlike in modern times, divine inheritances are never sold. <\/p> ",
