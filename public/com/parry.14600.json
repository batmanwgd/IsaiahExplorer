They have great relevance to us today; we too are of the house of Israel and inheritors of the promises given to Abraham.<\/p> <p><i>Holy One of Israel.<\/i> In the Old Testament this title for Jehovah is used almost exclusively by Isaiah, approximately twenty-four times. The term may signify \"Temple One of Israel,\" for in Hebrew the words for <i>holy<\/i> and <i>temple<\/i> derive from the same root. Elsewhere in his book Isaiah uses the same root when he calls God the \"Holy One of Jacob\" (29:23) and uses <i>holy<\/i> three times in his vision of the Lord sitting on His throne in the heavenly temple, or the celestial kingdom (6:3). We are to emulate the Lord: \"Ye shall therefore be holy, for I am holy\" (<a class=\"ref\">Lev. 11:45<\/a>). <\/p> <p><i>unto anger.<\/i> The scriptures testify of the indignation of God against the wicked: \"I, the Lord, am angry with the wicked\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 63:32<\/a>) also \"And it shall come to pass, because of the wickedness of the world, that I will take vengeance upon the wicked, for they will not repent; for the cup of mine indignation is full\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 29:17<\/a>). <\/p> ",
