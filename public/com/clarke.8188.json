I., p. 176), \"are only clay well moistened with water, and mixed with straw, and dried in the sun.\" So that their walls are commonly no better than our mud walls; see Maundrell, p. 124. That straw was a necessary part in the composition of this sort of bricks, to make the parts of the clay adhere together, appears from Exodus 5. These bricks are properly opposed to hewn stone, so greatly superior in beauty and durableness. The sycamores, which, as Jerome on the place says, are timber of little worth, with equal propriety are opposed to the cedars. \"As the grain and texture of the sycamore is remarkably coarse and spongy, it could therefore stand in no competition at all (as it is observed, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODQwXQ==\">Isaiah 9:10<\/a>;) with the cedar, for beauty and ornament.\" - Shaw, Supplement to Travels, p. 96. We meet with the same opposition of cedars to sycamores, <a class=\"ref\">1 Kings 10:27<\/a>, where Solomon is said to have made silver as the stones, and cedars as the sycamores in the vale for abundance. By this mashal, or figurative and sententious speech, they boast that they shall easily be able to repair their present losses, suffered perhaps by the first Assyrian invasion under Tiglath-pileser; and to bring their affairs to a more flourishing condition than ever. <\/p>\n\n <p>Some of the bricks mentioned above lie before me. They were brought from the site of ancient Babylon. The straw is visible, kneaded with the clay; they are very hard, and evidently were dried in the sun; for they are very easily dissolved in water. <\/p>",
