Hisce etiam Targum Jonathanis aliquatenus consentit, ubi, et aedificabunt. Confer infra Esai. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzM3XQ==\">Isaiah 54:13<\/a>, ad quem locum rabbini quoque notarunt en tractatu Talmudico Berachot, c. ix., <i>quod non legendum sit <\/i> <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d1\u05e0\u05d9\u05da <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, banayich<\/span>, id est. filii tui; sed <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d1\u05e0\u05d9\u05da <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, bonayich<\/span>, <i>aedificatores tui. Confer not. ad librum<\/i>, Prec. Jud. part ii., p. 226, ut et D Wagenseil Sot. p. 253, n. 9. \"The author of the Vulgate appears to have read <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d1\u05d5\u05e0\u05d9\u05da <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, bonayich<\/span>, for <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d1\u05e0\u05d9\u05da <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, banayich<\/span>, as he translates it by structures tui, 'thy builders.' The Septuagint is almost the same with the Vulgate, having <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u03c9\u0345\u03ba\u03bf\u03b4\u03bf\u03bc\u03b7\u03b8\u03b7\u03c2<\/span>, art built, as in the Plantin edition: but the Vatican or Roman copy reads <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u03bf\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03b4\u03bf\u03bc\u03b7\u03b8\u03b7\u03c3\u03b7\u0345<\/span>, those shalt be built. To these readings the Targum of Jonathan has some sort of correspondence, translating et aedificabunt, 'and they shall build.' See <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzM3XQ==\">Isaiah 54:13<\/a>; on which place the rabbins also remark, in the Talmudic tract Berachoth, c. 9, that we should not read <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d1\u05e0\u05d9\u05da <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, banayich<\/span>, thy sons, but <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d1\u05e0\u05d9\u05da <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, bonayich<\/span>, thy builders. See the note in Prae. Jud. part ii., p. 226, and also D. Wagenseil, Sot. p. 253, n. 9. \"See also Breithaupt. not. ad Jarchi in loc.; and the note on this place in De Sac. Poes. Hebr. Praelect. 31. Instead of <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d1\u05d5\u05e0\u05d9\u05da<\/span>, or <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d1\u05e0\u05d9\u05da <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, bonayich<\/span>, thy builders, several MSS. read <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d1\u05e0\u05d9\u05da <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, baneycha<\/span>, thy sons. So also the Syriac: see the above note. <\/p>\n\n <p> <em>Shall go forth of thee \"Shall become thine offspring\"\u2014 <\/em> <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d9\u05e6\u05d0\u05d5 \u05de\u05de\u05da <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, mimmech yetseu<\/span>, shall proceed, spring, issue, from thee, as thy children. The phrase is frequently used in this sense: see <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODg2XQ==\">Isaiah 11:1<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\">Micah 5:2; Nahum 1:11<\/a>. The accession of the Gentiles to the Church of God is considered as an addition made to the number of the family and children of Sion: see <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NjU4LDE4NjU5XQ==\">Isaiah 49:21, Isaiah 49:22<\/a>, and <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODI2XQ==\">Isaiah 60:4<\/a>. The common rendering, \"shall go forth of thee, or depart from thee,\" is very flat, after their zeal had been expressed by \"shall become thy builders:\" and as the opposition is kept up in one part of the sentence, one has reason to expect it in the other, which should be parallel to it. <\/p>",
