    "html": "<p>The metaphors the prophets drew from the land of Canaan had poignant spiritual messages. The spring rains, called the &ldquo;latter rains&rdquo; (<a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 3:3<\/a>), fall through April and May. During these rains the grass springs up in Israel as a spontaneous, green carpet over the land in such abundance and splendor that it seems it could never fail. Within a very short time the rains end, however, and the fierce summer heat turns the grass brown almost overnight. It simply seems to disappear across the barren hills. The withered, lifeless grass was the metaphor Isaiah chose to describe the wicked whose ways seem to be so attractive to the world but cannot endure long. Only those sanctified of the Lord will withstand the glory of His coming, for the wicked will be as the dried grass before a blazing fire.
