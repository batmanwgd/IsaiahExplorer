They labor incessantly for his people&rsquo;s restoration and intercede with him for their divine protection (cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgxMjAiOjF9XQ==\">v 1<\/a>). Like Jehovah&rsquo;s servant, they report what they see and hear (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgwNDIiOjV9XQ==\">Isaiah 21:6-10<\/a>) and proclaim Jehovah&rsquo;s coming: &ldquo;Hark! Your watchmen lift up their voice; as one they cry out for joy: for they shall see eye to eye when Jehovah returns [to] Zion&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg3MDUiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 52:8<\/a>; cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg3MDgiOjF9LHsiMTgxNjUiOjF9XQ==\">v 11; 27:13<\/a>).<\/p>",
