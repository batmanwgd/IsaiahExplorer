    "html": " <p>Isaiah began chapter 44 in the same spirit as he began chapter 43, by reminding Israel that they were the covenant people of the Lord. Jacob was the father of Israel. The Lord renewed the covenant He had made with Abraham with Jacob and changed his name to Israel because of his righteousness (<a class=\"ref\">Gen. 35:9&ndash;11 <\/a>). It is fitting, therefore, that the Lord also called this faithful servant &ldquo;Jesurun,&rdquo; (or Jeshurun), which is the Hebrew for <em>upright <\/em> or <em>righteous. <\/em> (See James Strong, <em>The Exhaustive Concordance of the Bible, <\/em> no. 3484 in &ldquo;Hebrew and Chaldee Dictionary&rdquo;; McConkie, <em>Mormon Doctrine, <\/em> p. 323.) <\/p> <p class=\"cite\"> LDS Church Educational System Old Testament Student Manual, 1 Kings&ndash;Malachi, Religion 302, Chapter 16, Item 28 <\/p> ",
