The words are an inference, not from the verses immediately foregoing, but from the whole prophecy: as if he had said, Seeing the Assyrian shall be destroyed, and the remnant of my people preserved and restored, <i>thus saith the Lord God of hosts <\/i>\u2014The Lord of all the armies of earth and heaven, the God superior to all human, yea, to all crested power; <i>O my people that dwellest in Zion <\/i>\u2014Where I dwell; where are the ordinances of my worship and service, my temple, my priests; the thrones of justice which I have established, and the princes of the house of David mine anointed; where my people assemble to worship me, and where I am present to defend them: <i>Be not afraid of the Assyrian <\/i>\u2014A man that shall die, the son of man that shall be as grass; forgetting the Lord thy maker, that stretched forth the heavens, and laid the foundations of the earth. <i>With his staff indeed shall he smite thee,<\/i>,(as Bishop Lowth translates it,) <i>and his rod shall he lift up against thee.<\/i>, He shall threaten and correct, yea, afflict thee, but not destroy thee; <i>after the manner of Egypt \u2014<\/i>, As the Egyptians formerly did, and with the same ill success to themselves, and comfortable issue to you. <\/p>",
