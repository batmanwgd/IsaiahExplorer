In their righteous and glorious future, he will intervene even before they have called on him in prayer (33:21-22). The Millennium will be a time of great revelation: \"In that day whatsoever any man shall ask, it shall be given unto him&hellip;. In that day when the Lord shall come, he shall reveal all things\u2014Things which have passed, and hidden things which no man knew\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 101:27,  32-33<\/a>). This statement directly contrasts with the statement in 66:4, in which the Lord called to Israel but no one would answer him.<\/p> ",
