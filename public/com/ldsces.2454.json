    "html": "<p><a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODg5OSI6N30=\">Isaiah 65:1&ndash;7<\/a> speaks of God as being found by those who did not seek Him. The Apostle Paul interpreted these verses to mean the Gentiles (see<a class=\"ref\">Romans 10:20&ndash;21<\/a>). The Prophet Joseph, in his inspired translation of the Bible, expanded the text and changed it: &ldquo;I am found of them who seek after me, I give unto all them that ask of me; I am not found of them that sought me not, or that inquireth not after me. I said unto my servant, Behold me, look upon me; I will send you unto a nation that is not called after my name, for I have spread out my hands all the day to a people who walketh not in my ways, and their works are evil and not good, and they walk after their own thoughts.&rdquo; (<a class=\"ref\">JST, Isaiah 65:1&ndash;2<\/a> .)<\/p><p>There is a difference between those who know that they should call upon the Lord but do not and those who do not call upon Him because they do not know they should. The Gentiles are in the latter category. Paul wrote that God manifested Himself to the Gentiles but not to the Jews because He had &ldquo;stretched forth [His] hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people&rdquo; all day long (for many generations), and they would not respond (<a class=\"ref\">Romans 10:21<\/a>). It is the Gentiles&rsquo; turn now.<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODkwMSI6NX0=\">Isaiah 65:3&ndash;7<\/a> describes the Lord&rsquo;s attitude toward those who, having been given much, return but little to the Giver.<\/p><p class=\"cite\"> LDS Church Educational System Old Testament Student Manual, 1 Kings&ndash;Malachi, Religion 302, Chapter 18, Item 26<\/p> ",
