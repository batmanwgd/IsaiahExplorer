Tribute came from the Arabians and Ammonites (<a class=\"ref\">2 Chronicles 26:8<\/a>). The words point to an earlier date than that at which Ahaz was left\u201d naked and distressed\u201d (<a class=\"ref\">2 Chronicles 28:19<\/a>). Even under Hezekiah, Sennacherib records in the inscription on the Taylor cylinder that the tribute paid by that king amounted to 30 talents of gold, and 800 talents of silver, besides wrought metal; and a like profusion of wealth, prior to Sennacherib\u2019s invasion, is shown in the account of Hezekiah\u2019s display of his treasures, in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDE1XQ==\">Isaiah 39:2<\/a> (Cheyne, in loc.; Records of the Past, i. 38). <\/p> \n <p>Their land is also full of . . . chariots.\u2014Here also the reign of Uzziah was like that of Solomon (<a class=\"ref\">1 Kings 10:26-28<\/a>). Chariots were used probably both for state pageants (<a class=\"ref\">Song of Solomon 1:9; Song of Solomon 3:9-10<\/a>) and as part of the mat\u00e9riel of war (<a class=\"ref\">2 Chronicles 1:14; 2 Chronicles 9:25<\/a>). Isaiah here also agrees with Micah (<a class=\"ref\">Micah 1:13<\/a>) in looking on this as \u201cthe beginning of sin\u201d (see <a class=\"ref\">Deuteronomy 17:16; 1 Samuel 8:11<\/a>). For him, as for Zechariah (<a class=\"ref\">Zechariah 9:9<\/a>), the true King was to come, not with chariots and horses, but riding, as the judges of Israel had ridden (<a class=\"ref\">Judges 5:10; Judges 10:4; Judges 12:14<\/a>), on \u201ca colt, the foal of an ass.\u201d <\/p> ",
