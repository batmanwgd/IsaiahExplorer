In a day when the world is awash in the filth of pornography, and immoral conduct is openly promoted and publicly condoned, this imperative of God extends to one's eyes, ears, and lips as well as to one's hands all should be pure before God. The covenant people of the Lord should maintain the purity that qualifies them to enter His holy house and His presence. (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 97:15-17<\/a>.)<\/p>",
