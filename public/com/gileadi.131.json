To be banished into that darkness or unknown is condemnation indeed: &ldquo;Redress remains far from us and righteousness is unable to reach us. We look for light, but there prevails darkness; for a glimmer [of hope], but we walk amid gloom. We grope along the borders like the blind; we flounder like those without eyes. We stumble at noon as in the dark of night; in the prime of life we resemble the dead&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg4MTAiOjJ9XQ==\">Isaiah 59:9-10<\/a>).<\/p>",
