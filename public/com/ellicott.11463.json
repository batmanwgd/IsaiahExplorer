    "html": "<p>             (22) The former things.\u2014Not, as the Authorised Version suggests, the things of the remote past, but those that lie at the head, or beginning of things to come\u2014the near future. Can the false gods predict them as the pledge and earnest of predictions that go farther? Can they see a single year before them? We note that the challenge exactly corresponds to Isaiah\u2019s own method of giving \u201csigns\u201d that his words are not idly spoken (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 7:10-14<\/a>; <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 38:7-8<\/a>). The other meaning is maintained, however, by some critics as more in harmony with <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 43:18<\/a>. The things \u201cfor to come\u201d lie, as it were, in the middle future, the \u201chereafter\u201d of <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 41:23<\/a>, in the more remote. All are alike hidden from the gods of the heathen oracles.<\/p>",
