Because they epitomize &ldquo;dumb watchdogs&rdquo; and &ldquo;lolling seers,&rdquo; Jehovah replaces them with a righteous watchman&mdash;his servant&mdash;and other watchmen: &ldquo;Go and appoint a watchman who reports what he sees&rdquo; ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MDQyXQ==\">Isaiah 21:6<\/a>); &ldquo;I have appointed watchmen on your walls, O Jerusalem, who shall not be silent day or night&rdquo; ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODYxXQ==\">Isaiah 62:6<\/a>).<\/p><p>As the job of Jehovah&rsquo;s watchmen is to report to his people what they see and hear ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MDQ2LDE4NjMxXQ==\">Isaiah 21:10; 48:16<\/a>), those who are blind and unaware see and hear little of consequence and fail to warn his people: &ldquo;Who is blind but my own servant, or so deaf as the messenger I have sent? Who is blind like those I have commissioned, as uncomprehending as the servant of Jehovah&mdash;seeing much but not giving heed, with open ears hearing nothing?&rdquo; ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODUwMCI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 42:19-20<\/a>.
