It is reasonable to assume that Isaiah's wife had heard him speak often of the coming of the Messiah and that she too had a testimony of Christ. In this respect, it is of interest to note the words of President Wilford Woodruff: \"Anybody is a prophet who has a testimony of Jesus Christ, for that is the spirit of prophecy.\" (JD 13:165.) The term \"prophetess\" is also used to identify other faithful women of the Bible such as Miriam (<a class=\"ref\">Exodus 15:20<\/a>), Deborah (<a class=\"ref\">Judges 4:4-5<\/a>), and Anna (<a class=\"ref\">Luke 2:36-38<\/a>).<\/p>",
