Persons in government, whose task is to protect society from predators, have turned into predators themselves. The would-be administrators of justice perpetrate injustice. The most needy elements of society&mdash;the fatherless and widows, whose cause Jehovah advocates (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NjcyXQ==\">v 17 <\/a>)&mdash;are neglected. People in leadership positions have degenerated into &ldquo;renegades&rdquo; and &ldquo;robbers,&rdquo; officials who violate others&rsquo; rights in order to gain their own ends (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc3MjIiOjJ9LFsxNzc2MywxODIxNV1d\">Isaiah 3:14-15; 5:23; 29:21 <\/a>). <\/p> ",
