Though <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05e2\u05dc \u05db\u05df<\/span>, (<i>gnal ken<\/i>) literally signifies <i>therefore<\/i>, yet some think that a reason is not here assigned; but that is of little importance. The Prophet shows that there will be none that does not <i>howl<\/i>,; for he declares that the bold and courageous shall mourn. Next he adds, <i>the soul of every one shall howl to him.<\/i>, Every one shall be so engrossed with his own grief, that he will not think of his neighbors. <\/p>",
