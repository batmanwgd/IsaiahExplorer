The ideal Divine King is to be all, and more than all, that Solomon had been ( <a class=\"ref\">1 Kings 10:24<\/a>). In reliance on His wisdom and equity, nations would refer their disputes to His decision instead of the arbitrament of war. Here again we have a partial fulfilment, it may be hoped, a \u201cspringing and germinant accomplishment,\u201d in the history of Christendom. So far as the teaching of Christ has influenced international polity and law, He has been the supreme arbitrator of their disputes.<\/p> \n<p>And they shall beat their swords into plowshares.\u2014The words invert the picture of an earlier prophet, who spoke of a time of war ( <a class=\"ref\">Joel 3:10<\/a>). Isaiah must have known that prediction, and yet he proclaims (following <a class=\"ref\">Hosea 2:18<\/a>) that peace, not war, is the ideal goal towards which the order of the Divine government is tending. (Comp. <a class=\"ref\">Zechariah 9:10; Luke 2:14<\/a>.)<\/p> ",
