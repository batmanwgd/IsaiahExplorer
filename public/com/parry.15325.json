This phrase is difficult to understand but seems to refer to the events connected with the passing away of the heavens and the earth, which will occur at Christ's second coming: \"Behold, will ye believe in the day of your visitation\u2014behold, when the Lord shall come, yea, even that great day when the earth shall be rolled together as a scroll, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, yea, in that great day when ye shall be brought to stand before the Lamb of God\u2014then will ye say that there is not God?\" (<a class=\"ref\">Morm. 9:2<\/a>). <\/p> <p><i>their host shall fall down&hellip;as a falling fig from the fig tree.<\/i> A modern-day revelation explains, \"For not many days hence and the earth shall tremble and reel to and fro as a drunken man; and the sun shall hide his face, and shall refuse to give light; and the moon shall be bathed in blood; and the stars shall become exceedingly angry, and shall cast themselves down as a fig that falleth from off a fig-tree\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 88:87<\/a>). As shriveled fruit or dry leaves fall from the tree, so shall the stars (<a class=\"ref\">Mark 13:25; D&amp;C 45:42<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\">Rev. 8:10<\/a>) fall from the heavens (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 88:87; Rev. 6:13-14<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\"> 8:10<\/a>). <\/p> ",
