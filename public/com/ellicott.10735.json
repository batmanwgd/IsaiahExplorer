    "html": "<p>             (5) Why should ye be stricken any more? ye will revolt more and more.\u2014Better, by revolting more and more. The prophet does not predict persistency in rebellion, but pleads against it. (Comp. \u201cWhy will ye die?\u201d in <a class=\"ref\">Ezekiel 18:31<\/a>.)<\/p>\n <p>The whole head is sick. . . .\u2014Better, every head. . . . every heart. The sin of the people is painted as a deadly epidemic, spreading everywhere, affecting the noblest organs of the body (see Note on <a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 17:9<\/a>), and defying all the resources of the healing art. The description that follows is one of the natural parables of ethics, and reminds us of Plato\u2019s description of the souls of tyrants as being full of ulcerous sores (Gorg., c. 80). The description may have connected itself with the prophet\u2019s personal experience or training in the medicine and surgery of his time, or with the diseases which came as judgments on Jehoram (<a class=\"ref\">2 Chronicles 21:18<\/a>) and Uzziah (<a class=\"ref\">2 Chronicles 26:20<\/a>). We find him in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 38:21<\/a> prescribing for Hezekiah\u2019s boil. It would seem, indeed, from <a class=\"ref\">2 Chronicles 16:12<\/a>, that the prophets, as an order, practised the art of healing, and so were rivals of the \u201cphysicians,\u201d who depended chiefly on idolatrous charms and incantations. The picture of the disease reminds us of the language of <a class=\"ref\">Deuteronomy 28:22-35; Job 2:7<\/a>, and of the descriptions of like pestilences in the history of Florence, and of England. Every part of the body is tainted by the poison. \u201cWe note a certain technical precision in the three terms used: \u201cwounds\u201d (literally, cuts, as inflicted by a sword or knife); \u201cbruises,\u201d or weals, marks of the scourge or rod; \u201cputrifying sores,\u201d wounds that have festered into ulcers. As the diagnosis is technical, so also are the therapeutic agencies. To \u201cclose\u201d or \u201cpress\u201d the festering wound was the process tried at first to get rid of the purulent discharge; then, as in Hezekiah\u2019s case (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 38:21<\/a>), it was \u201cbound up,\u201d with a poultice, then some stimulating oil or unguent, probably, as in <a class=\"ref\">Luke 10:34<\/a>, oil and wine were used, to cleanse the ulcer. No such remedies, the prophet says, had been applied to the spiritual disease of Israel.<\/p>",
