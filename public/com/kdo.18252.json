    "html": "<p> The similes which follow cannot be attached to this <em> na\u0302zo\u0304llu\u0304 <\/em> , however we may explain it. Yet <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODg3XQ==\">Isaiah 64:1<\/a> (2) does not form a new and independent sentence; but we must in thought repeat the word upon which the principal emphasis rests in  (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODg3XQ==\">Isaiah 64:1<\/a>). \u201c(<em> Wouldst come down<\/em> ) <em> as fire kindles brushwood, fire causes water to boil; to make known Thy name to Thine adversaries, that the heathen may tremble before Thy face! When Thou doest terrible things which we hoped not for; wouldst come down, <\/em> (<em> and<\/em> )<em> mountains shake before Thy countenance!<\/em> \u201d The older expositors gave themselves a great deal of trouble in the attempt to trace <em> ha\u0306ma\u0302s\u0131\u0304m <\/em> to <em> m a\u0302sas <\/em> , to melt. But since Louis de Dieu and Albert Schultens have followed Saadia and Abulw\u00e2lid in citing the Arabic <em> hms <\/em> , to crack, to mutter, to mumble, etc., and <em> hs\u030cm <\/em> , to break in pieces, <em> confringere <\/em> , from which comes <em> hashim <\/em> , broken, dry wood, it is generally admitted that <em> ha\u0306ma\u0302sim <\/em> is from <em> hemes <\/em> (lit. crackling, rattling, Arab. <em> hams <\/em> ), and signifies \u201cdry twigs,\u201d <em> arida sarmenta <\/em> . The second simile might be rendered, \u201cas water bubbles up in the fire;\u201d and in that case <em> m ayim <\/em> would be treated as a feminine (according to the rule in Ges. \u00a7146, 3), in support of which <a class=\"ref\">Job 14:19<\/a> may be adduced as an unquestionable example (although in other cases it is masculine), and \u05d0\u05e9\u05c1 = \u05d1\u05bc\u05d0\u05e9\u05c1 would be used in a local sense, like <em> leha\u0302bha\u0302h <\/em> , into flames, in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzY0XQ==\">Isaiah 5:24<\/a>. But it is much more natural to take \u05d0\u05e9\u05c1 , which is just as often a feminine as \u05de\u05d9\u05dd is a masculine, as the subject of \u05ea\u05bc\u05d1\u05e2\u05d4 , and to give to the verb \u05d1\u05bc\u05e2\u05d4 , which is originally intransitive, judging from the Arabic <em> bga\u0302 <\/em> , to swell, the Chald. \u05d1\u05bc\u05d5\u05bc\u05e2 , to spring up (compare \u05d0\u05d1\u05e2\u05d1\u05bc\u05e2\u05d5\u05ea , blisters, pustules), the Syr. \u05d1\u05bc\u05d2\u05d0 , to bubble up, etc., the transitive meaning to cause to boil or bubble up, rather than the intransitive to boil (comp. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MjMxXQ==\">Isaiah 30:13<\/a>, \u05e0\u05d1\u05e2\u05d4 , swollen = bent forwards, as it were <em> protumidus <\/em> ). Jehovah is to come down with the same irresistible force which fire exerts upon brushwood or water, when it sets the former in flames and makes the latter boil; in order that by such a display of might He may make His name known (viz., the name thus judicially revealing itself, hence \u201cin fire,\u201d <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MjQ1LDE4OTM4XQ==\">Isaiah 30:27; Isaiah 66:15<\/a>) to His adversaries, and that nations (viz., those that are idolaters) may tremble before Him ( \u05de\u05e4\u05bc\u05e0\u05d9 \u05da : cf., <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 68:2-3<\/a>). The infinitive clause denoting the purpose, like that indicating the comparison, passes into the finite (cf., <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODUzLDE3OTE2LDE3OTU0XQ==\">Isaiah 10:2; Isaiah 13:9; Isaiah 14:25<\/a>). Modern commentators for the most part now regard the optative <em> lu\u0304' <\/em> (O that) as extending to <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODg4XQ==\">Isaiah 64:2<\/a> also; and, in fact, although this continued influence of <em> lu\u0304' <\/em> appears to overstep the bounds of the possible, we are forced to resort to this extremity. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODg4XQ==\">Isaiah 64:2<\/a> cannot contain a historical retrospect: the word \u201cformerly\u201d would be introduced if it did, and the order of the words would be a different one. Again, we cannot assume that \u05e0\u05d6\u05dc\u05bc\u05d5\u05bc \u05d4\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd \u05de\u05e4\u05bc\u05e0\u05d9 \u05da \u05d9\u05e8\u05d3\u05ea\u05bc contains an expression of confidence, or that the prefects indicate certainty. Neither the context, the foregoing \u05e0\u05d5\u05e8\u05d0\u05d5\u05ea \u05d1\u05bc\u05e2\u05e9\u05c2\u05d5\u05ea \u05da \u05e0\u05d5 (why not \u05e2\u05e9\u05c2\u05d4 ?), nor the parenthetical assertion \u05e0\u05e7\u05d5\u05bc\u05d4 \u05dc\u05d0 , permits of this. On the other hand, \u05d5\u05d2\u05d5 \u05d1\u05e2\u05e9\u05c2\u05d5\u05ea\u05da connects itself very appropriately with the purposes indicated in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODg3XQ==\">Isaiah 64:1<\/a> (2.): \u201cmay tremble when Thou doest terrible things, which we, i.e., such as we, do not look for,\u201d i.e., which surpass our expectations. And now nothing remains but to recognise the resumption of <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODg2XQ==\">Isaiah 63:19<\/a> (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODg3XQ==\">Isaiah 64:1<\/a>) in the clause \u201cThe mountains shake at Thy presence,\u201d in which case <a href=\"\/\/www.studylight.org\/desk\/index.cgi?q1=Isaiah+63:19&t1=en_nas\" id=\"17\" class=\"stL\" target=\"_blank\">Isaiah 63:19<\/a><em> b<\/em> -64:2 (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODg4NyI6M30=\">Isaiah 64:1-3<\/a>) forms a grand period rounded off palindromically after Isaiah's peculiar style.<\/p>",
