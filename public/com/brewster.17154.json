    "html": "<p><b>(<a class=\"ref\">2 Nephi 8:6<\/a>).<\/b>\"<i>The heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the earth shall wax old like a garment.<\/i>\" The heavens will vanish (be dispersed) and the earth wax old (decay). This has reference to \"the day of the Lord\" or second coming. (<a class=\"ref\">2 Peter 3:10<\/a>.) Many signs and wonders will occur in the heavens at that time, which may include those seen by the prophet Joel: \"And I will shew wonders in the heavens and in the earth, blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke. The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and the terrible day of the Lord come.\" (<a class=\"ref\">Joel 2:30-31<\/a>; see also JS H 1:41; BICQ, 183-87.) The earth will undergo a baptism of fire, which will cleanse it of wickedness for the millennial reign of Christ. This cleansing will also prepare it for its final transformation following the last judgment, at which time \"the earth will die; it will be dissolved, pass away, and then it will be renewed, or raised with a resurrection. It will receive its resurrection to become a celestial body,\" said President Joseph Fielding Smith. (See BICQ, 195-96, 235.) At both the beginning and the end of the Millennium there will be a \"new heaven and new earth.\" (See BICQ, 219-20.)<\/p>",
