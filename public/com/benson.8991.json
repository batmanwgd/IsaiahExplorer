    "html": "<p><a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 2:20<\/a>.<i>In that day a man shall cast his idols, &c., to the moles and to the bats <\/i>\u2014 Shall cast them into the meanest and darkest places, in which moles and bats have their abode; whereas before they set them up in high and honourable places, where they might be seen and worshipped. Or, as Bishop Lowth thinks the meaning may be. \u201cThey shall carry their idols with them into the dark caverns, old ruins, or desolate places, to which they shall flee for refuge; and so shall give them up, and relinquish them to the filthy animals that frequent such places, and have taken possession of them as their proper habitation.\u201d The wasting of Judah by the Syrians and Israelites in the time of Ahaz, might be here first in the prophet\u2019s view, when, besides a great multitude that were partly slain, and partly carried captive to Damascus by the Syrians, the king of Israel slew in Judah one hundred and twenty thousand in one day, and carried away captive, of men, women, and children, two hundred thousand, taking away also much spoil, <a class=\"ref\">2 Chronicles 28:5-6; 2 Chronicles 28:8<\/a>. The prophecy may refer, secondly, to the invasion of the country by Sennacherib; but, undoubtedly, the destruction of Judah and Jerusalem by the Chaldeans, and the Babylonish captivity, are chiefly intended, for then idolatry was entirely abolished among the Jews, and never practised by them afterward.<\/p>",
