    "html": "<p><em>His watchmen are blind -<\/em>Kimchi observes, \"The flock is intrusted to the care of these watchmen. The wild beasts come; these dogs bark not; and the wild beasts devour the flock. Thus they do not profit the flock. Yea, they injure it; for the owner trusts in them, that they will watch and be faithful; but they are not. These are the false teachers and careless shepherds.\"<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Dumb dogs, they cannot bark -<\/em>See note on  <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTg4NjE=\">Isaiah 62:6<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Sleeping \"Dreamers\" -<\/em><span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d4\u05d6\u05d9\u05dd <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">hozim<\/span>, <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u03b5\u03bd\u03c5\u03c0\u03bd\u03b9\u03b1\u03b6\u03bf\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9<\/span>, Septuagint. This seems to be the best authority for the meaning of this word, which occurs only in this place: but it is to be observed, that eleven MSS. of Kennicott's and De Rossi's, and four editions, have <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d7\u05d6\u05d9\u05dd <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">chazim<\/span>, seers, or those who see; and so the Vulgate seems to have read, <i>videntes vana<\/i>, \"seeing vain things.\"<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Loving to slumber -<\/em><span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05dc\u05e0\u05d5\u05dd <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">lanum<\/span> : but six of Kennicott's and seven of De Rossi's MSS. read <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05dc\u05e0\u05d5\u05e1 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">lanus<\/span>, to fly, \"to change their residence:\" but what connection such reading can have with the sense of the passage, I cannot discern. What is taken for <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05e1 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">samech<\/span>  here is, I have no doubt, a narrow formed final <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05dd <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">mem<\/span>, which has been mistaken for the above. Many instances occur in my own MSS., where the final <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05dd <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">mem<\/span>  is similar to the <span class=\"translit\">samech<\/span> ; and yet no such change was intended by the scribe.<\/p>",
