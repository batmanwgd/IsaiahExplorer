Elder Ezra Taft Benson quoted this scripture as a key for not being deceived and said that this great truth from Isaiah was so important that it was included in the Book of Mormon (see CR, Oct. <i>1963,<\/i> p. 16). President Joseph Fielding Smith quoted verse 19 as an example of the Lord's warning Israel not to seek after \"familiar spirits\" or other \"devices prevalent among the heathen nations\" <i>(<\/i>AQ<i>,<\/i> 4:33). The Prophet Joseph Smith used the phrase \"to the law and to the testimony\" (verse 20) in reference to the scriptures generally (see TPJS<i>,<\/i> pp. 373-74).<\/p>     ",
