The prophets are here called <i>(<span class=\"translit\">tso\u0304ph\u0131\u0304m<\/span>), spies, as persons who looked into the distance as if from a watch-tower (<i>specula<\/i>, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzIyNzUwXQ==\">Isaiah 21:6; Habakkuk 2:1<\/a>) just as in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 56:10<\/a>. It is assumed that the people of the captivity would still have prophets among them: in fact, the very first word in these prophecies (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 40:1<\/a>) is addressed to them. They who saw the redemption from afar, and comforted the church therewith (different from <i>(<span class=\"translit\">mebhasse\u0304r<\/span>), the evangelist of the fulfilment), lift up their voice together with rejoicing; for they see Jehovah bringing back Zion, as closely as one man is to another when he looks directly into his eyes (<a class=\"ref\">Numbers 14:14<\/a>). <span class=\"normal hebrew\">\ufb31<\/span> is the same as in the construction <span class=\"normal hebrew\">\ufb31<\/span> <span class=\"normal hebrew\">\u05e8\u05d0\u05d4<\/span>; and <span class=\"normal hebrew\">\u05e9\u05c1\ufb35\u05d1<\/span> has the transitive meaning reducere<\/i>, restituere<\/i> (as in <a class=\"ref\">Psalm 14:7; Psalm 126:1<\/a>, etc.), which is placed beyond all doubt by <span class=\"normal hebrew\">\u05e9\u05c1\ufb35\u05d1\u05e0\ufb35<\/span> in <a class=\"ref\">Psalm 85:5<\/a>.<br><\/p>",
