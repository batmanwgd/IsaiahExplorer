The curse between the seed of the woman (the child) and the serpent (<a class=\"ref\">Gen. 3:15<\/a>) will be gone. The serpents here call to mind \"that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan\" (<a class=\"ref\">Rev. 12:9<\/a>), whose intent it is to harm and destroy the souls of mankind. Satan, however, will be bound during the Millennium, with all of his angels, so that peaceful conditions can hold sway.<\/p> ",
