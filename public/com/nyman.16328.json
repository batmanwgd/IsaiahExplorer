(<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzA1LDE3NzA3XQ==\">Isaiah 2:19, 21.<\/a>)<\/p>     <p>And they shall go into the holes of the rocks, and into the caves of the earth, for the fear of the Lord shall come upon them and the glory of his majesty shall smite them, when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth ....<\/p>     <p>To go into the clefts of the rocks, and into the tops of the ragged rocks, for the fear of the Lord shall come upon them and the majesty of his glory shall smite them, when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth. (<a class=\"ref\">2 Ne. 12:19, 21.<\/a>)<\/p>     <p>The first retention seems insignificant, but the last shows that all attempts to hide will be fruitless. The reversal of majesty and glory seems insignificant. The previous commentary on 2:10 is also applicable here, since the phrase \"for the fear of the Lord and the glory of his majesty\" is used in all three verses.<\/p>     ",
