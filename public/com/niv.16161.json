Each stanza deals with a different feature of Egypt in which the Egyptian people might be inclined to trust: the gods of Egypt, the Nile (the river of Egypt), and the fabled wisdom of Egypt. Each of these is shown to fail, leaving the Egyptians disgraced and despairing.<\/p>     <p>\u2003<b>Isaiah 19:1\u20134.<\/b> In several places Israelite writers appropriate the imagery of the Canaanite storm god Baal to say that the Lord rides upon the clouds (e.g., Deut. 33:26; Ps. 68:4; 104:3). So here it is not the Assyrian armies from the north whom the Egyptians should fear, but the God from the north, whose chariots are the clouds (Isa. 19:1). Compared to him, the multitudinous \u201cidols\u201d of Egypt (19:1, 3) are utterly helpless.<\/p>     <p>\u2003Certainly Egypt was the most polytheistic of all the peoples of the ancient Near East; they compare favorably for sheer number of gods with modern Hinduism. But all those gods, along with the spiritist practices associated with the polytheistic worldview, are helpless before the living God. They cannot prevent the kind of anarchy that historically occurred in Egypt when the central government collapsed (19:2). The Egyptians were an orderly people who hated change of all sorts. As a result, when rapid change came, they tended to \u201close heart\u201d (19:3), and order quickly gave way to disorder. Many possibilities exist for the identity of the \u201ccruel master\u201d of 19:4, from Piankhy the Ethiopian to Ashurbanipal the Assyrian, but the point is that this person will only rule at the sufferance of Yahweh, the God of Israel.<\/p>     <p>\u2003<b>Isaiah 19:5\u201310.<\/b> The Egyptians referred to their land as \u201cthe gift of the Nile.\u201d That is literally true. If it were not for the Nile River, Egypt would be simply an eastern extension of the Sahara Desert. For centuries the Nile has with clocklike regularity brought irrigation water and new topsoil to the land. Because of that water and fertility, the land has produced abundant crops, which in turn have made possible the leisure necessary to develop a high culture. In addition to its agricultural significance, the river has been a route of commerce and a military highway. Thus, Egypt and the Nile are inseparable.<\/p>     <p>\u2003But Isaiah says that it is foolish to put one\u2019s trust in any natural resource, even one as dependable as the Nile. Thus, he envisions a day when the mighty river will run dry, along with all the activities dependent on it: agriculture (19:7), fisheries (19:8), and flax-making (19:9\u201310).<\/p>     <p>\u2003<b>Isaiah 19:11\u201315.<\/b> Even more than its complex religion and its mighty river, Egypt was known in the ancient world for its wisdom and culture. But Isaiah says all of that will prove helpless in the face of God\u2019s plan. Although a connection cannot be proven, it is tempting to think that there is an allusion to the Joseph narrative in the inability of all the Egyptian wise men to tell the pharaoh what the Lord has \u201cplanned\u201d for Egypt (19:12). Since they cannot even do that, Isaiah wonders how they dare to call themselves \u201cwise\u201d (19:11).<\/p>     <p>\u2003The language of 19:14 is like that found in chapter 28, where the prophet condemns the leaders of Judah for giving foolish counsel (cf. 28:7\u20138). Isaiah 19:15 uses the same language as 9:14 to describe the leadership of the land. As there, \u201chead or tail, palm branch or reed\u201d are figures of totality, like the English \u201ctop to bottom.\u201d Egypt\u2019s entire collection of counselors is helpless to discern what Israel\u2019s God is going to do with them and their land.<\/p>     ",
