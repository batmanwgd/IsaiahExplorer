    "html": "<p>             (8) The head of Syria is Damascus . . .\u2014The prediction of the failure of the alliance is emphasised. Each city, Damascus and Samaria, should continue to be what it was, the head of a comparatively weak kingdom, and should not be aggrandised by the conquest of Judah and Jerusalem. There is an implied comparison of the two hostile cities and their kings with Jerusalem and its supreme King, Jehovah. Bolder critics, like Ewald, assume that a clause expressing that contrast has been displaced by that which now follows, and which they reject as a later interpolation.<\/p>\n <p>Within threescore and five years shall Ephraim be broken.\u2014Assuming the genuineness of the clause, we have in it the first direct chronological prediction in the prophet\u2019s utterances. Others follow in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3OTg0XQ==\">Isaiah 16:14<\/a>; <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3OTg1XQ==\">Isaiah 17:1<\/a>; <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MDQyXQ==\">Isaiah 21:6<\/a>; <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MDc5XQ==\">Isaiah 23:1<\/a>. Reckoning from B.C. 736 as the probable date of the prophecy, the sixty-five years bring us to B.C. 671. At that date Assyrian inscriptions show that Assurbanipal, the \u201cAsnapper\u201d of <a class=\"ref\">Ezra 4:2-10<\/a>, co-regent with his father Esarhaddon, had carried off the last remnant of the people of Samaria, and peopled it with an alien race (Smith\u2019s Assurbanipal, p. 363). This completed the work which had been begun by Salmaneser and Sargon (<a class=\"ref\">2 Kings 17:6<\/a>). Ephraim then was no more a people.<\/p>",
