    "html": " <p> (10) I have refined thee, but not with silver . . .\u2014The meaning is obscure, and perhaps depends on some unknown process in ancient metallurgy. Commonly the refining of silver is taken as a parable of God\u2019s dealings with His people (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NjgwXQ==\">Isaiah 1:25 <\/a>; <a class=\"ref\">Ezekiel 22:18-22; Malachi 3:3 <\/a>). Here the thought seems to be that the discipline had been less fierce than that of the refiner\u2019s fire. Silver was \u201cpurified seven times in the fire\u201d (<a class=\"ref\">Psalms 12:6 <\/a>); but that would have brought about the destruction of Israel, and He sought to spare them. <\/p> \n <p>I have chosen thee.\u2014Better, I have tested thee. <\/p> ",
