    "html": "               <p>I<small>SAIAH NOW PRONOUNCES<\/small> judgment on the Judeans, who are again called \u201crebellious people, deceitful children\u201d (30:9). He begins by describing their attitude (30:8\u201311) and then turns to the specific announcement of the judgment caused by that attitude (30:12\u201314). Then in a third section (30:15\u201318), he details what God has invited them to do, what will be the results of their refusal to accept his invitation, and what he must do in response. Most commentators take verse 18 with the third section of the oracle (30:19\u201326), since this verse has a hopeful tone. However, I believe it is really the conclusion of the judgment messages, as I will try to show.<\/p>     <p>\u2003In 30:8 Isaiah offers the purpose of writing down prophetic words, so that when the predictions came true, people will know it (cf. 8:1, 16; 29:11, 18). He defines the rebellion of the people more clearly. Not only are they unwilling to consult with God when forming their plans, they do not want to hear \u201cthe LORD\u2019s instruction\u201d (30:9) or \u201cwhat is right\u201d (30:10). Instead, they ask the prophets to say pleasant things to them. They do not want Isaiah to confront them. Undoubtedly they do not actually ask for \u201cillusions\u201d (30:10), but Isaiah says that is what they are actually asking for when they demand that he stop telling them about \u201cthe Holy One of Israel.\u201d<\/p>     <p>\u2003Ironically, Isaiah\u2019s response to that demand is to tell them \u201cwhat the Holy One of Israel says\u201d (30:12). The text emphasizes the causal connection between the people\u2019s actions and the coming destruction, both with the opening \u201ctherefore\u201d and with the subsequent \u201cbecause.\u201d They have \u201crejected\u201d the truth that God alone can be trusted and instead have trusted in \u201coppression\u201d and lies, grinding the poor to get money to pay Egypt for its worthless help. As a result, their destruction will come as suddenly as a collapsing wall.<\/p>     <p>\u2003We can imagine a wall whose stones have been leaning a bit more each year, with the result that people have simply gotten used to it. But then one day the center of gravity is passed and in an instant it comes down. So it will be with Assyria. For years Assyria has been threatening, but then the day will suddenly come when Assyria will devastate the land. There will be nothing left. Judah will be like a smashed pot with the pieces so small that they will be useless for any other tasks.<\/p>     <p>\u2003God has told them again and again the prescription for their condition. They must turn back to him in \u201crepentance\u201d and \u201crest\u201d in him (30:15). In quietly trusting him instead of frantically rushing around trying to solve their problems for themselves, they will find both \u201csalvation\u201d and \u201cstrength.\u201d But the patient has refused the physician\u2019s prescription.<\/p>     <p>\u2003Isaiah 30:16 offers a strong contrast with 30:15. Instead of quietness and trust, there will be rapid flight. There is only one problem with that course of action: The \u201cpursuers\u201d will be swifter yet. If the people rested in God, flight would not be necessary. But because they have refused to trust him, flight will not be enough. Once it becomes apparent that their strength is not enough, retreat will turn into headlong rout, with a \u201cthousand\u201d running from \u201cone,\u201d for they will have no inner resources to face any other alternative than victory. As a result, they will be as forlorn as a tattered flag whipping in the wind, with nothing but corpses surrounding it (30:17).<\/p>     <p>\u2003So what is God\u2019s course of action in the face of this reality? Will he wash his hands of them? Will he abandon them in a fit of well-justified rage? No, in one of the greatest statements in all of Scripture, he says that since Israel will not wait for (trust in) him, he will have to wait (NIV \u201clongs\u201d) to be gracious to them. He \u201crises\u201d from his throne\u2014not to bring final destruction but to show \u201ccompassion.\u201d Because he is a \u201cGod of justice,\u201d those \u201cwho wait for him\u201d will never be disappointed. Those who wait for the nations will be disappointed again and again because they are serving themselves and not the causes of right and truth. But God will unfailingly do what is right, and we can depend on him, no matter what. Thus, Isaiah presents the picture of the Creator of the universe patiently standing, waiting for us to discover what fools we have been and to turn back to him to receive the grace and compassion that are in his fatherly heart.<\/p>     ",
