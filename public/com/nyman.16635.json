The Doctrine and Covenants describesthis event of the land's being \"married\" in more modern terms:<\/p>     <blockquote>He shall command the great deep, and it shall be driven back into the north countries, and the islands shall become one land; <\/blockquote>     <blockquote>And the land of Jerusalem and the land of Zion shall be turned back into their own place, and the earth shall be like as it was in the days before it was divided. (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 133:23-24<\/a>.)<\/blockquote>     <p>This catastrophic event of the last days will occur in conjunction with the return of the lost tribes out of the north countries (see <a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 133:26-30; 3 Ne. 21:23-26<\/a>). Incidentally, this passage from the Doctrine and Covenants confirms that the division of the earth recorded in <a class=\"ref\">Gen. 10:25<\/a> was a literal division and not just a spiritual or ideological one, as some criticssuppose.<\/p>     ",
