Now there was no prospect of such an event\u201d when Isaiah uttered this prediction, namely, \u201cwhile the Assyrians were in the midst of their successes and triumphs; but still the word of the prophet prevailed; and it was not long after these calamities brought upon the Jews, that the Assyrian empire, properly so called, was overthrown, and Nineveh destroyed.\u201d<\/p> ",
