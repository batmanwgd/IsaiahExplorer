The Zion spoken of by the Old Testament prophets was identified by the Prophet Joseph Smith as the whole of North and South America (see <i>TPJS,<\/i> p. 362). The \"Assyrians\" in verse 24 would thus symbolize the Gentiles who were inhabiting that land and were ruling over the blood of Israel scattered among them or living under their rule. The plea is for the Israelites to rely upon the Lord. While they may have trials and tribulations, these will be short-lived and the promised blessings of Israel will be restored.<\/p>     ",
