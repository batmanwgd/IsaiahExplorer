    "html": " <p>Like the wounds, bruises, and sores of an enemy slave&mdash;one who receives no chance of being ministered to&mdash;Jehovah&rsquo;s alienated people find themselves in pitiful circumstances. When someone in a gulag becomes ill, that is his problem; he is dispensable. That is the condition to which Jehovah&rsquo;s people are reduced in his Day of Judgment. Like the Prodigal Son, they have rebelled against Jehovah and squandered their inheritance. Then, when their entire society breaks down, their curse becomes irrevocable. Nevertheless, although a majority suffers misery, there remains hope for some who repent. <\/p> <p> <em>Nor soothed with ointment. <\/em> The idea of being &ldquo;soothed with ointment,&rdquo; which is denied the wicked, Jehovah doesn&rsquo;t deny the righteous. We observe his healing and anointing his repentant people later in the Book of Isaiah (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODI0NF0seyIxODc4NCI6Mn0sWzE4Nzk1LDE4ODQ3XV0=\">Isaiah 30:26; 57:18-19; 58:8; 61:3<\/a>). It is for the reader to discover such antitheses by searching Isaiah&rsquo;s terms and concepts. In other words, although Isaiah has us wade through the judgmental parts of his prophecy before he presents Jehovah&rsquo;s glorious promises, all doesn&rsquo;t end in gloom and doom. If Jehovah&rsquo;s people repent in time, they may yet qualify for his divine blessings. <\/p> ",
