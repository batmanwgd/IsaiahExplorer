Ancient Babylon was destroyed as quickly as a whirlwind passes through the desert, and so will modern Babylon be devastated. \"And again, verily I say unto you, the coming of the Lord draweth nigh, and it overtaketh the world as a thief in the night.\" For us, the command is, \"gird up your loins, that you may be the children of light, and that day shall not overtake you as a thief\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 106:4-5<\/a>). <\/i><\/p> ",
