The prophets often speak of the ceremonies of Moses\u2019s law as of no value, without that inward purity, and true spiritual worship, and devotedness to God, which were signified by them. This was a very proper method to prepare the minds of the Jews for the reception of the gospel, by which those ceremonies were to be abolished. <i>When ye come to appear before me <\/i>\u2014Upon the three solemn feasts, or upon other occasions. <i>Who hath required this at your hand? <\/i>\u2014The thing I commanded was not only, nor chiefly, that you should offer external sacrifices, but that you should do it with true repentance, with faith in my promises, and sincere resolutions of devoting yourselves to my service. <\/p> ",
