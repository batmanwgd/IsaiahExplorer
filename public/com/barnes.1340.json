This festival was kept at first at night, and was required to be so celebrated ever afterward <a class=\"ref\">Exodus 12:42; Deuteronomy 16:1-6 <\/a>. <\/p> <p> <em>As when one goeth with a pipe <\/em>&mdash;Music was used in the daily service of the temple, and their processions and celebrations were all with instrumental music.
