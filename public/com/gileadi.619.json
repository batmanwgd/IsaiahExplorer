    "html": "<p>Isaiah draws on many heroes in Israel&rsquo;s history who serve as types of Jehovah&rsquo;s end-time servant: Abraham, who came from the east and called on the name of Jehovah (<a class=\"ref\">Genesis 12:8; 13:4<\/a>; <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDU0LDE4NDc3XQ==\">Isaiah 41:2, 25<\/a>); Moses, who led Israel out of bondage in Egypt (<a class=\"ref\">Exodus 14:1-31<\/a>; <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODY0NSI6NX0=\">Isaiah 49:8-12<\/a>); David, whom Jehovah endowed with his holy Spirit (<a class=\"ref\">1 Samuel 16:13<\/a>; <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODg3LDE4NDgyLDE4ODQ1XQ==\">Isaiah 11:2; 42:1; 61:1<\/a>); Solomon, who became renowned among the nations (<a class=\"ref\">1 Kings 10:1<\/a>; <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzEwLDE4NzEyXQ==\">Isaiah 52:13, 15<\/a>); and Cyrus, who released Israel&rsquo;s exiles and decreed the rebuilding of Jerusalem and its temple (<a class=\"ref\">Ezra 6:3-5<\/a>; <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NTYwLDE4NTYyLDE4NTYzLDE4NTc1XQ==\">Isaiah 44:26, 28; 45:1, 13<\/a>).<\/p><p><a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzY1NiI6MzF9\">Verse 12<\/a> reveals other such ancient types: Caleb, who received &ldquo;an inheritance among the great&rdquo; for his integrity (<a class=\"ref\">Joshua 14:14<\/a>); David, who &ldquo;divide[d] the spoil with the mighty&rdquo; when he vanquished the Amalekites (<a class=\"ref\">1 Samuel 30:26<\/a>); Hezekiah, who &ldquo;poured out his soul unto death&rdquo; during his illness (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODM5MiI6MjB9\">Isaiah 38:1-20<\/a>); David, who was &ldquo;numbered with criminals&rdquo; when Saul outlawed him (<a class=\"ref\">1 Samuel 22:1-2<\/a>); Job, who &ldquo;[bore] the sins of many&rdquo; upon the lavish lifestyle of his children (<a class=\"ref\">Job 1:5<\/a>); and Moses, who &ldquo;made intercession for trans&shy;gressors&rdquo; when Israel worshiped an idol (<a class=\"ref\">Deuteronomy 9:16-29<\/a>).<\/p><p>A clear distinction thus exists between Jehovah and his servant. While one makes his life &ldquo;an offering for guilt&rdquo; and dies like &ldquo;a lamb&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODM5OCI6NH0=\">vv 7-10<\/a>), the other lives to &ldquo;divide the spoil&rdquo; and receive &ldquo;an inheritance&rdquo; in the land (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDAzXQ==\">v 12<\/a>). In other words, although one does not experience a reversal of circumstances in his lifetime, the other does when Jehovah heals and empowers him (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg2NDQiOjJ9LFsxODY4MywxODc4NF1d\">Isaiah 49:7-8; 51:9; 57:18<\/a>). As no savior&rsquo;s descent phase occurs without a corresponding ascent phase, however, Jehovah&rsquo;s coming in glory to reign as King of Zion constitutes his ascent phase (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg3MDQiOjJ9LHsiMTg4MjAiOjJ9LFsxODg2Nl1d\">Isaiah 52:7-8; 59:19-20; 62:11<\/a>).<\/p>",
