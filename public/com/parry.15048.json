Shebna is the proud, wicked person who looks after his own welfare before seeking the good of others. Eliakim is the priestly minister whose concern is others, such as the widow and the fatherless. In the end, Shebna does not obtain a monumental grave but dies in shame; Eliakim takes his rightful place in his Father's kingdom and receives glory.<\/i><\/p> ",
