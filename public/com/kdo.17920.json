    "html": "<p> So runs the divine oracle to which the following command refers. <em> \u201cNow go, write it on a table with them, and note it in a book, and let it stand there fore future days, for ever, to eternity.\u201d<\/em> The suffixes of <em> kothba\u0302h <\/em> (write it) and <em> c huqqa\u0302h <\/em> (note it) refer in a neuter sense to <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MjI0LDE4MjI1XQ==\">Isaiah 30:6, Isaiah 30:7<\/a>; and the expression \u201cgo\u201d is simply a general summons to proceed to the matter (cf., <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MDY4XQ==\">Isaiah 22:15<\/a>). <em> Se\u0304pher <\/em> could be used interchangeably with <em> lu\u0304a\u0306ch <\/em> , because a single leaf, the contents of which were concluded, was called <em> se\u0304pher <\/em> (<a class=\"ref\">Exodus 17:14<\/a>). Isaiah was to write the oracle upon a table, a separate leaf of durable material; and that \u201cwith them,\u201d i.e., so that his countrymen might have it before their eyes (compare <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODA5LDIyNzUxXQ==\">Isaiah 8:1; Habakkuk 2:2<\/a>). It was to be a memorial for posterity. The reading \u05dc\u05e2\u05d3 (Sept., Targ., Syr.) for \u05dc\u05e2\u05d3 is appropriate, though quite unnecessary. The three indications of time form a climax: for futurity, for the most remote future, for the future without end.<\/p>",
