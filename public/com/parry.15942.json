In addition, the blood of our sins\u2014the signs of our wickedness\u2014will stain his garments. This blood of atonement is symbolized by the image of a man who treads red grapes in a winepress, staining his clothing with the juice. But, with Christ, not only his hem but his whole garment will be stained. His whole being was engaged in the work of atonement. He trod the winepress alone because he alone could and did perform the Atonement, kneeling alone in the Garden of Gethsemane, hanging alone on the cross. \"I&hellip;have trodden the winepress alone, even the winepress of the fierceness of the wrath of Almighty God\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 76:107; 88:106<\/a>). <\/p> <p><i>will tread them in mine anger\/trample them in my fury.<\/i> Christ has trodden the winepress in offering the Atonement in the Garden of Gethsemane; but he will yet tread the nations in vengeance, even as in the winepress one treads on the grapes to force out the juice. Both acts stain his garments with blood (34:6; <a class=\"ref\">Joel 3:13; Lam. 1:15<\/a>). <\/p> ",
