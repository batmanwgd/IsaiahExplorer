    "html": "<p>Like the ancient Jacob\/Israel category of Jehovah&rsquo;s people, its end-time counterpart acts presumptuously. Its religion consists of going through the motions of worship but &ldquo;not in truth or in righteousness&rdquo;&mdash;not by Jehovah&rsquo;s standard of <em>righteousness<\/em> as exemplified by his servant (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODQ1NF0seyIxODU5OCI6M31d\">Isaiah 41:2; 46:11-13<\/a>). Its sins include improperly &ldquo;taking oaths&rdquo; or covenanting in the name of Jehovah and inappropriately &ldquo;invoking&rdquo; or referring to him. Yet they assume they are upheld by the God of Israel whose heavenly &ldquo;hosts&rdquo; are holy (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDQ3XQ==\">Isaiah 40:26<\/a>) even as their hypocrisy renders them and their &ldquo;city&rdquo; unholy.<\/p>",
