How can ye be ignorant of so evident a truth? He addresses his speech to the idolatrous Gentiles; <i>from the beginning <\/i>\u2014 Namely, of the world, as the next clause explains it: were not these infinite perfections of God manifestly discovered to all mankind, by the creation of the world? <i>It is he that sitteth <\/i>\u2014 As a judge or governor upon his throne; <i>upon, <\/i>or rather, <i>above, the circle of the earth <\/i>\u2014 Far above this round earth, even in the highest heavens; from whence he looketh down upon the earth, where men appear to him like grasshoppers. As here we have <i>the circle of the earth, <\/i>so elsewhere we read of <i>the circle of heaven, <\/i><a class=\"ref\">Job 22:14<\/a>, and of <i>the circle of the deep, <\/i>or <i>sea, <\/i><a class=\"ref\">Proverbs 8:27<\/a>, because the form of the heaven, and earth, and sea, is circular. <i>Spreadeth them out as a tent <\/i>\u2014 For the benefit of the earth and of mankind, that all parts might partake of their comfortable influences. <i>That bringeth the princes to nothing <\/i>\u2014 Who can, at his pleasure, destroy all the great potentates of the world. <i>Yea, they <\/i>\u2014 The princes and judges last mentioned; <i>shall not be planted, <\/i>&c. \u2014 They shall take no root, for <i>planting <\/i>and <i>sowing <\/i>are in order to taking root. They shall not continue and flourish, as they have vainly imagined, but shall be rooted up, and perish.<\/p>",
