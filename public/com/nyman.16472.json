The Jewish Publication Society Translation capitalizes and singularizes the word \"Teacher\" in verse 20, showing that they consider the verse to be a messianic prophecy of the time following their affliction among the nations, when they shall see the Messiah among them. But verse 21 shows that the Holy Ghost will also be their guide. Elder Thomas S. Monson cited this verse as a reference to the \"still, small voice which testifies of truth\" (CR, Apr. 1975, p. 23). Elder Marion D. Hanks said this verse provided an example of the right voice to follow among the world's many existing voices (see CR, Oct. 1965, p. 120), and he cited verse 18 as an example of the Father's waiting until we recognize our need and open the door for him (see CR, Apr. 1972, pp. 126-27; see also CR, Oct. 1977, p. 56). Elder Mark E. Petersen referred to this verse to show that the Lord expects us to walk in his way (see CR, Apr. 1977,p. 110). <\/p>     ",
