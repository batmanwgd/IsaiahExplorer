    "html": "<p>Moab&rsquo;s self-exaltation&mdash;like that of Greater Babylon&mdash;inevitably leads to humiliation in Jehovah&rsquo;s Day of Judgment: &ldquo;The haughty eyes of men shall be lowered and man&rsquo;s pride abased; Jehovah alone shall be exalted in that day. Jehovah of Hosts has a day in store for all the proud and arrogant and for all who are exalted, that they may be brought low&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc2OTciOjJ9XQ==\">Isaiah 2:11-12<\/a>). Rather than look down on the Moabites and glory at their fall, Jehovah&rsquo;s people weep for them and deeply sorrow at their plight (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc2OTUiOjJ9XQ==\">vv 9, 11<\/a>). They were a kindred people who lived alongside them, with whom Jehovah&rsquo;s people interacted.<\/p>",
