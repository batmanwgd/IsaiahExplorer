    "html": " <p>As Jehovah is &ldquo;supreme&rdquo; or exalted over all, he orchestrates the events that lead to the destruction of the wicked and deliverance of the righteous. Those who emulate his justice and righteousness he &ldquo;replenishes&rdquo; or recompenses through his <em>righteousness <\/em>&mdash;through the ministry of his servant. Their &ldquo;faithfulness&rdquo; or loyalty to Jehovah through adverse times pays off at the last. Although deprived of worldly riches, they chose wisely, with the certain &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo; that Jehovah, their <em>salvation <\/em>,, would help them. Their reverent awe or &ldquo;fear&rdquo; of him kept them on a righteous path and qualified them for it. <\/p>,",
