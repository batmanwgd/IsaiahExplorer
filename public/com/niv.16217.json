division of Isaiah: chapters 40\u201355. The question of the Lord\u2019s trustworthiness has been thoroughly answered. But the question remains: What will motivate the people of God to actually trust him and become the servants that they are called to be? Furthermore, how will it be possible for sinful Israel to become God\u2019s servants at all? What is to be done about the sin that has alienated them from God?<\/p>     <p>\u2003To answer these questions the prophet projects himself out into the future where these questions will be seen in their full poignancy. In the context of the coming Babylonian exile, he addresses the questions he knows the exiles will be prompted to ask by that crisis. Chapters 40\u201355 answer the questions in two subdivisions. (1) Chapters 41\u201348 address Israel\u2019s captivity in Babylon. If they are to be the redeemed servants of the Lord, they need to be free in order to worship God in the land of the promises. These chapters speak of God\u2019s capacity to deliver and his desire to do so. (2) Chapters 49\u201355 address the prior issue of what needs to be done about the sin that got the people in their dilemma in the first place.<\/p>     <p>\u2003Isaiah recognizes that the Exile will bring up questions about these issues. Although the questions are never specifically stated, answers are given again and again to implied questions. The first answer is: \u201cI am God, and there is no other; I am God, and there is none like me\u201d (46:9, etc.). The second is: \u201cSo do not fear, for I am with you; do not be dismayed, for I am your God\u201d (41:10, etc.). What, then, are the questions? They are: \u201cHas not God been defeated by the gods of Babylon?\u201d and \u201cHas not our sin separated us from God forever?\u201d To both of these, Isaiah answers with a resounding \u201cno.\u201d God has not been defeated either by the Babylonian gods or by his people\u2019s sin. In fact, God will use the evidence of their lives to demonstrate his sole Godhood. Far from being cast off, they will be his witnesses in his case against the idols.<\/p>     <p>\u2003These two themes emerge at once in chapter 40. The chapter has two main divisions: verses 1\u201311 and verses 12\u201326, with verses 27\u201331 acting as a kind of summary conclusion. In the first section, the question of whether God has cast his people away is addressed. Echoing the words of Isaiah 12, where this event is anticipated, God speaks not judgment but comfort. He will deliver them, and they will be in a position to tell the world of the deliverance. Then in 40:12\u201326, he speaks of his ability to deliver them. He is the incomparable God, like whom there is no other. The nations of earth are nothing to him, so they need not fear that they have been abandoned. They need only to wait in hope for the time to come (40:27\u201331).<\/p>     <p>\u2003The dominant idea here is that of the undeserved grace of God. This is what will motivate the people to trust God, just as was intimated in chapter 12. When God delivers his people without any deserving on their part, they will at last be willing to cast themselves on him without reservation. So if chapters 7\u201339 were about trust as the basis for servanthood, chapters 40\u201355 are about grace as the motive and the means of servanthood.<\/p>     ",
