The synonymous parallelism of Hezekiah&rsquo;s not seeing &ldquo;Jehovah&rdquo; in the land of the living and his not beholding &ldquo;Man&rdquo; among those dwelling in mortality characterizes Jehovah as a man, albeit a divine Man. In spite of Judeo-Christianity&rsquo;s Hellenistic concept of an amorphous God, therefore, the biblical God resembles an exalted man (<a class=\"ref\">Genesis 18; 32:24-30; 32:24-30 <\/a>). <\/p> ",
