    "html": "<p>Using the imagery of a negligent steward as a prophetic allegory, Isaiah predicts his replacement by Jehovah&rsquo;s &ldquo;servant&rdquo; ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODA3MyI6NX0=\">vv 20-24<\/a>). Jehovah rebukes Shebna&mdash;calling him &ldquo;that steward&rdquo;&mdash;for assuming he will receive a lavish burial when he passes away. As a part of the reversal of circumstances between Greater Babylon and Zion, this passage reiterates how that which exalts itself ends up humiliated and that which humbles itself Jehovah exalts. Jesus predicts this very scenario prior to his second coming, when &ldquo;a faithful and wise servant&rdquo; succeeds &ldquo;an evil servant&rdquo; ( <a class=\"ref\">Matthew 24:44-51<\/a>).<\/p> ",
