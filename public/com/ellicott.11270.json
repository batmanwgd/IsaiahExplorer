The wrath of the judge sweeps onward like an autumn torrent, threatening to engulf all that stand in its way.<\/p>\n <p>To sift the nations with the sieve of vanity.\u2014Better, the winnowing fan of nothingness. Sifting is, as elsewhere, the symbol of judgment (so Osiris appears in Egyptian monuments armed with a flail, as the judge of the dead; Cheyne), and the \u201cfan\u201d in this case is one which threatens to annihilate the guilty.<\/p>\n <p>A bridle in the jaws of the people.\u2014The words find a parallel in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTgzODI=\">Isaiah 37:29<\/a>. The enemies of Jehovah should find themselves under a constraining power, leading them on against their will to their own destruction. Quem Deus vult perdere, prius dementat.<\/p>",
