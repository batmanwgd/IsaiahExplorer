    "html": "<p>Because the higher a person ascends spiritually the greater the descent through trials that precedes it, so the Zion\/Jerusalem category of Jehovah&rsquo;s people&mdash;those of Jacob\/Israel who repent of transgression (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODIxXQ==\">Isaiah 59:20<\/a>)&mdash;endures greater afflictions than before. So much, that at times those who are in the midst of their descent phase feel that Jehovah has forsaken or forgotten them. Jehovah reminds them that he never forgets them, that <em>he<\/em> went through descent before ascent when they &ldquo;pierced my hands and my feet&rdquo; as he atoned for their sins (<a class=\"ref\">Psalm 22:16<\/a>; cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg1MzAiOjJ9LHsiMTg3MTYiOjJ9LHsiMTg4NzUiOjJ9XQ==\">Isaiah 43:24-25; 53:4-5; 63:8-9<\/a>).<\/p><p>Zion\/Jerusalem&rsquo;s travail resembles that of a woman when she gives birth, the whole purpose being Zion\/Jerusalem&rsquo;s rebirth or re-creation on a higher spiritual level: &ldquo;Who has heard the like, or who has seen such things? Can the earth labor but a day and a nation be born at once? For as soon as she was in labor, Zion gave birth to her children. &lsquo;Shall I bring to a crisis and not bring on birth?&rsquo; says Jehovah. &lsquo;When it is I who cause the birth, shall I hinder it?&rsquo; says your God&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODkzMSI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 66:8-9<\/a>; cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg5NDMiOjN9LFsxODU3MywxODcyNV1d\">vv 20-22; 45:11; 54:1<\/a>). Jehovah&rsquo;s covenant love and loyalty far exceed a mortal mother&rsquo;s toward her child.<\/p>",
