    "html": "<p> The second half of the prophecy commences with <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NTU1XQ==\">Isaiah 44:21<\/a>. It opens with an admonition. <em> \u201cRemember this, Jacob and Israel; for thou art my servant: I have formed thee; thou art servant to me, O Israel: thou art not forgotten by me.\u201d<\/em> The thing to which the former were blind - namely, that idolatry is a lie - Jacob was to have firmly impressed upon its mind. The words \u201cand Israel,\u201d which are attached, are a contract for \u201cand remember this, O Israel\u201d (compare the vocatives after <em> Va\u0302v <\/em> in <a class=\"ref\">Proverbs 8:5<\/a> and <a class=\"ref\">Joel 2:23<\/a>). In the reason assigned, the tone rests upon <em> my<\/em> in the expression \u201cmy servant,\u201d and for this reason \u201cservant to me\u201d is used interchangeably with it. Israel is the servant of Jehovah, and as such it was formed by Jehovah; and therefore reverence was due to Him, and Him alone. The words which follow are rendered by the lxx, Targum, Jerome, and Luther as though they read \u05dc\u05d0 \u05ea\u05e0\u05e9\u05c1\u05e0\u05d9 , though Hitzig regards the same rendering as admissible even with the reading \u05ea\u05e0\u05bc\u05e9\u05e0\u05bc\u05d9 , inasmuch as the <em> niphal<\/em> \u05e0\u05e9\u05bc\u05c1\u05d4 has the middle sense of \u03b5\u0313\u03c0\u03b9\u03bb\u03b1\u03bd\u03b8\u03b1\u0301\u03bd\u03b5\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9 , <em> oblivisci <\/em> . But it cannot be shown that <em> nizkar <\/em> is ever used in the analogous sense of \u03bc \u03b9\u03bc\u03bd\u03b7\u0301\u03c3\u03ba\u03b5\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9 , <em> recordari <\/em> . The <em> niphal<\/em> , which was no doubt originally reflective, is always used in Hebrew to indicate simply the passive endurance of something which originated with the subject of the action referred to, so that <em> nissha\u0302h <\/em> could only signify \u201cto forget one's self.\u201d We must indeed admit the possibility of the meaning \u201cto forget one's self\u201d having passed into the meaning \u201cto be forgetful,\u201d and this into the meaning \u201cto forget.\u201d The Aramaean \u05ea\u05e0\u05e9\u05c1\u05d9 also signifies to be forgotten and (with an accent following) to forget, and the connection with an objective suffix has a support in \u05d5\u05d9\u05bc\u05dc\u05bc\u05d7\u05de\u05d5\u05bc\u05e0\u05d9 in <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 109:3<\/a>. But the latter is really equivalent to \u05d0\u05ea\u05bc\u05d9 \u05d5\u05d9\u05dc\u05d7\u05de\u05d5 , so that it may be adduced with equal propriety in support of the other rendering, according to which \u05ea\u05bc\u05e0\u05bc\u05e9\u05c1\u05e0\u05d9 is equivalent to \u05dc\u05d9 \u05ea\u05e0\u05e9 (Ges., Umbr., Ewald, Stier). There are many examples of this brachyological use of the suffix (Ges. \u00a7121, 4), so that this rendering is certainly the safer of the two. It also suits the context quite as well as the former, \u201cOh, forget me not;\u201d the assurance \u201cthou wilt not be forgotten by me\u201d (compare <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NjUyXQ==\">Isaiah 49:15<\/a> and the lamentation of Israel in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDQ4XQ==\">Isaiah 40:27<\/a>) being immediately followed by an announcement of the act of love, by which the declaration is most gloriously confirmed. - <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NTU2XQ==\">Isaiah 44:22<\/a> <em> \u201cI have blotted out thy transgressions as a mist, and thy sins as clouds: return to me; for I have redeemed thee.\u201d<\/em> We have adopted the rendering \u201cmist\u201d merely because we have no synonym to \u201ccloud;\u201d we have not translated it \u201cthick cloud,\u201d because the idea of darkness, thickness, or opacity, which is the one immediately suggested by the word, had become almost entirely lost (see <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTI0XQ==\">Isaiah 25:5<\/a>). Moreover, \u05e7\u05dc \u05e2\u05d1 is evidently intended here (see <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MDA2XQ==\">Isaiah 19:1<\/a>), inasmuch as the point of comparison is not the dark, heavy multitude of sins, but the facility and rapidity with which they are expunged. Whether we connect with \u05de\u05e1\u05d4\u05d9\u05ea\u05d9 the idea of a stain, as in <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 51:3, Psalms 51:11<\/a>, or that of a debt entered in a ledge, as in <a class=\"ref\">Colossians 2:14<\/a>, and as we explained it in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NTMxXQ==\">Isaiah 43:25<\/a> (cf., <em> m a\u0302cha\u0302h <\/em> , <a class=\"ref\">Exodus 32:32-33<\/a>), in any case sin is regarded as something standing between God and man, and impeding or disturbing the intercourse between them. This Jehovah clears away, just as when His wind sweeps away the clouds, and restores the blue sky again (<a class=\"ref\">Job 26:13<\/a>). Thus does God's free grace now interpose at the very time when Israel thinks He has forgotten it, blotting out Israel's sin, and proving this by redeeming it from a state of punishment. What an evangelical sound the preaching of the Old Testament evangelist has in this passage also! Forgiveness and redemption are not offered on condition of conversion, but the mercy of God comes to Israel in direct contrast to what its works deserve, and Israel is merely called upon to reciprocate this by conversion and renewed obedience. The perfects denote that which has essentially taken place. Jehovah has blotted out Israel's sin, inasmuch as He does not impute it any more, and thus has redeemed Israel. All that yet remains is the outward manifestation of this redemption, which is already accomplished in the counsel of God.<\/p>",
