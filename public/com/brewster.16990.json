First, kings (royalty, pharaohs, presidents, etc.) are generally buried with great pomp, ceremony, and splendor. Second, even wicked kings, once they have paid the price of penance and suffered the wrath of God (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 76:103-12<\/a>), will be redeemed from the grave and resurrected to a degree of glory in the eternities. However, Lucifer and his minions will be cast into outer darkness, where there will be neither light nor glory. (See <a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 88:24<\/a>; DCE, 301-2.)<\/p>",
