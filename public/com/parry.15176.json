    "html": " <p>The Northern Kingdom of Israel, under the leadership of the tribe of Ephraim, will fall under condemnation because of pride and wickedness (28:1). As a result, a mighty and strong nation (Assyria; 28:2) has been commissioned to accomplish eagerly and swiftly the judgments of the Lord (28:3-4).<\/p> <p>In the last days, the \"residue\" of the children of Israel will consider the Lord to be \"a crown of glory\" and \"a diadem of beauty\" (28:5); they will find wisdom and strength in their association with him (28:6).<\/p> <blockquote>Woe to the crown of pride, to the drunkards of Ephraim,     <br>whose glorious beauty is a fading flower,     <br>which are on the head of the fat valleys:     <br>of them that are overcome with wine! (28:1)     <br>Behold, the Lord hath a mighty and strong one,     <br>which as a <i>tempest of hail<\/i> and a <i>destroying storm,<\/i>     <br>as a <i>flood of mighty waters <\/i>overflowing,     <br>shall cast down to the earth with the hand. (28:2)     <br>The crown of pride,     <br>the drunkards of Ephraim,     <br>shall be trodden under feet: (28:3)     <br>And the glorious beauty,     <br>which is on the head of the fat valley,     <br>shall be a fading flower,     <br>and as the [early ripe fig] before the summer;     <br>which when he that looketh upon it seeth,     <br>while it is yet in his hand he eateth it up. (28:4)     <br>In that day shall the Lord of hosts be for a <i>crown<\/i> of <u>glory<\/u>,     <br>and for a <i>diadem<\/i> of <u>beauty<\/u>, unto the residue of his people, (28:5)     <br>And for a <i>spirit of judgment<\/i> to <u>him that sitteth in judgment<\/u>,     <br>and for <i>strength<\/i> to <u>them that turn the battle to the gate<\/u>. (28:6)     <br>But they also have <i>erred<\/i> through <u>wine<\/u>,     <br>and through <u>strong drink<\/u> are <i>out of the way;<\/i>     <br>the priest and the prophet have <i>erred<\/i> through <u>strong drink<\/u>,     <br>they are <i>swallowed up<\/i> of <u>wine<\/u>,     <br>they are <i>out of the way<\/i> through <u>strong drink<\/u>;     <br>they <i>err<\/i> in <u>vision<\/u>,     <br>they <i>stumble<\/i> in <u>judgment<\/u>. (28:7)     <br>[Indeed] all tables are full of vomit and filthiness, so that there is no place clean. (28:8)<\/blockquote> ",
