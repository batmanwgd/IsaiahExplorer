    "html": "<p><em>For wickedness -<\/em>Wickedness rageth like a fire, destroying and laying waste the nation: but it shall be its own destruction, by bringing down the fire of God's wrath, which shall burn up the briers and the thorns; that is, the wicked themselves. Briers and thorns are an image frequently applied in Scripture, when set on fire, to the rage of the wicked; violent, yet impotent, and of no long continuance. \"They are extinct as the fire of thorns,\"  <a class=\"ref\">Psalm 118:12<\/a>. To the wicked themselves, as useless and unprofitable, proper objects of God's wrath, to be burned up, or driven away by the wind. \"As thorns cut up they shall be consumed in the fire,\"  <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTgyOTI=\">Isaiah 33:12<\/a>. Both these ideas seem to be joined in  <a class=\"ref\">Psalm 58:9<\/a>; : - <\/p>\n\n<p>   \"Before your pots shall feel the thorn,<\/p>\n\n<p>   As well the green as the dry, the tempest shall bear them away.\"<\/p>\n\n<p>The green and the dry is a proverbial expression, meaning all sorts of them, good and bad, great and small, etc. So Ezekiel: \"Behold, I will kindle a fire, and it shall devour every green tree, and every dry tree,\"  <a class=\"ref\">Ezekiel 20:47<\/a>. D'Herbelot quotes a Persian poet describing a pestilence under the image of a conflagration: \"This was a lightning that, falling upon a forest, consumed there the green wood with the dry.\" See Harmer's Observations, Vol. II., p. 187.<\/p>",
