On one occasion Joseph Smith taught that \"we need purging, purifying and cleansing.\" <\/p> <p><i>dross.<\/i> The term applies both to the wicked who are as <i>dross<\/i> and to the wickedness that is within each of us (see commentary on 1:22).<\/p> <p><i>tin.<\/i> In biblical times (as now), metals were graded according to their degree of availability. Gold and silver were the most precious metals; tin, brass, lead, and iron were less precious (<a class=\"ref\">Ezek. 22:18-22; Dan. 2:31-42<\/a>). Tin in this context may represent mediocre individuals who are more righteous than those identified with dross but not as precious as those likened to gold or silver (1:22).<\/p> ",
