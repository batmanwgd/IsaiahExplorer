The latter seems most in harmony with the context. In the later ritual of the Feast of Tabernacles, the priests went in solemn procession to the Pool of Siloam, filled a golden vase with water, carried it to the Temple, and poured it out on the western side of the altar of burnt offering, while the people chanted the great Hallel (Hymn of Praise) of Psalms 113-118 (See Note on <a class=\"ref\">John 7:37<\/a>.) If we may assume that this represented the ritual of the monarchy, we may reasonably infer that the words of Isaiah pointed to it. The Talmud expressly connects the act with the symbolism of Isaiah\u2019s words (Jer. Succa, v. 1), and the prophet\u2019s reference to the \u201cwaters of Shiloah\u201d in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 8:6<\/a>, confirms the inference.<\/p>",
