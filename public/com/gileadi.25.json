    "html": " <p>The two parallel statements&mdash;&ldquo;I will restore&rdquo; (<em>&rsquo;asibah <\/em>) (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzY4MCI6Mn0=\">vv 25-26 <\/a>)&mdash;signify not only that both restorations form a part of the same event but that one flows out of the other. In other words, the refinement &ldquo;as in a crucible&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NjgwXQ==\">v 25 <\/a>) that results in pure silver or gold leads to the appointment of righteous leaders &ldquo;as at the first&rdquo; and &ldquo;as in the beginning&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NjgxXQ==\">v 26 <\/a>). That leadership of Jehovah&rsquo;s people follows the pattern of Moses and Israel&rsquo;s judges (<a class=\"ref\">Exodus 18:13-26 <\/a>), who established a theocratic government: &ldquo;A king shall reign in righteousness and rulers rule with justice&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MjYxXQ==\">Isaiah 32:1 <\/a>; cf. <a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 23:1-5 <\/a>). <\/p> <p> <em>After this you shall be called the City of <strong>Righteousness <\/strong>,, a faithful city <\/em>,. While the once-faithful &ldquo;city&rdquo; becomes a &ldquo;harlot&rdquo;&mdash;a place in which &ldquo;righteousness&rdquo; no longer abides (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3Njc2XQ==\">v 21 <\/a>)&mdash;Jehovah&rsquo;s cleansing results in a city of righteousness grounded in principles of righteousness and founded by <em>righteousness <\/em>&mdash;Jehovah&rsquo;s servant (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODQ1NF0seyIxODU5OCI6M31d\">Isaiah 41:2; 46:11-13 <\/a>). That city, called &ldquo;Zion&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NjgyXQ==\">v 27 <\/a>), Jehovah preserves from a Sodom-and-Gomorrah type of destruction (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzY2MyI6Mn0=\">vv 8-9 <\/a>). Two &ldquo;cities&rdquo; thus emerge in the Book of Isaiah: one wicked, the other righteous; one destroyed, the other delivered (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODEyMV0seyIxODEzMiI6Nn0sWzE4MzAwXV0=\">Isaiah 25:2; 26:1-6; 33:20 <\/a>). <\/p>,",
