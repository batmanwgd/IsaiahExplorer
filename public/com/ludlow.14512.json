However, his message speaks to more than the sinners of his time; it is a warning to <em>all <\/em>the unrighteous&mdash;ancient and modern, Jew and Gentile, Latter-day Saints and members of other faiths. Yet, Isaiah&rsquo;s words in 2 Nephi 14 include some of Isaiah&rsquo;s grandest images, foretelling redemption and divine protection that will bless the righteous Israelites in the latter days. This message is ultimately one of comfort, for he promises that Zion will be protected and her inhabitants redeemed in the millennial day. From these combined messages, we are assured that the Lord will justly and completely reward the disobedient and the obedient.<\/p> ",
