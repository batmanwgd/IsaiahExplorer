    "html": "<p>The &ldquo;land of Judah&rdquo;&mdash;a codename of the Promised Land&mdash;is where Jehovah&rsquo;s people at home find safety in the righteous &ldquo;city,&rdquo; counterpart of the wicked &ldquo;city&rdquo;<em><\/em> that descends into the dust (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgxMzYiOjJ9LFsxODEzMSwxODYwMV1d\">vv 5-6; Isaiah 25:12; 47:1<\/a>). Respectively representing Zion and Greater Babylon, these &ldquo;cities&rdquo; coexist briefly until Jehovah delivers the one and destroys the other. Those comprising the righteous city sing a Song of Salvation, knowing that Jehovah&mdash;their <em>salvation<\/em>&mdash;now dwells with them and protects them better than the &ldquo;walls and barricades&rdquo; that failed to keep their enemies at bay (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc2OTgiOjR9LHsiMTc3NDUiOjJ9LFsxODA2MV1d\">Isaiah 2:12-15; 5:5-6; 22:8<\/a>).<\/p>",
