    "html": "<p><em>Art thou not it<\/em>&mdash;Art thou not still the same? The ground of the appeal is, that the same arm that dried up the sea, and made a path for the Jewish people, was still able to interpose and rescue them.<\/p><p><em>Which hath dried the sea<\/em>&mdash;The Red Sea when the children of Israel passed over <a class=\"ref\">Exodus 14:21<\/a>. This is the common illustration to which the Hebrew prophets and poets appeal, when they wish to refer to the interposition of God in favor of their nation (compare <a class=\"ref\">Psalm 105<\/a> ; see the notes at <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 43:16<\/a>).<\/p><p><em>For the ransomed to pass over<\/em>&mdash;Those who had been ransomed from Egypt. The word rendered &lsquo;ransomed&rsquo; is that which is commonly rendered &lsquo;redeemed.&rsquo; The argument in this verse is, that he who had overcome all the obstacles in the way of their deliverance from Egypt, was able also to overcome all the obstacles in the way of their deliverance from Babylon; and that he who had thus interposed might be expected again to manifest his mercy, and save them again from oppression. The principle involved in the argument is as applicable now as it was then. All God&rsquo;s past interpositious&mdash;and especially the great and wonderful interposition when be gave his Son for his church&mdash;constitute an argument that be will still continue to regard the interests of his people, and will interpose in their behalf and save them.<\/p>",
