    "html": " <i>new moon\/sabbath.<\/i> One of Israel's greatest sins was her corruption of the Lord's ordained feasts and holy days (1:13), two of which are alluded to here, \"in the sabbaths, in the new moons\" (<a class=\"ref\">1 Chr. 23:31<\/a>; <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODgwMCI6Mn0=\">Isa. 58:13-14<\/a>). In the millennial Zion, these feasts will regain their intended respect and will be kept perfectly, symbolizing the perfect worship that will be found in Zion.<\/p> <p><i>all flesh come to worship before me.<\/i> All the nations, even those that formerly oppressed Israel, will worship the Lord in the temple together (<a class=\"ref\">Zech. 14:16<\/a>). This continues the promise of verses 19-20, where the nations became \"your brethren.\" According to the <i>Interpreter's Bible,<\/i> \"These two verses form a fitting conclusion to a great prophetic book&hellip;. Israel is the nation of priests, but chosen [so] that along with her all flesh may pay homage to the God of the whole earth. It is in worship that the unity of the nations is realized\u2014<i>before me.<\/i>\" <\/p> ",
