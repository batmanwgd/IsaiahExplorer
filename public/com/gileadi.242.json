    "html": " <p>A supremely industrialized and agricultural land, Egypt spirals into decay. Where once there existed plenty, now a dearth prevails. Where once Egyptians were gainfully employed, now they remain idle. Even traditionally staple livelihoods disappear. A spirit of &ldquo;misery,&rdquo; &ldquo;dismay,&rdquo; &ldquo;despair,&rdquo; and &ldquo;distress&rdquo; pervades Egypt&rsquo;s society (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MDA4XQ==\">v 3<\/a>). A hitherto highly prosperous nation is imploding, leaving its large populace without seeming recourse (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MDIwXQ==\">v 15<\/a>). Like all who make up Greater Babylon, Egypt&mdash;the most elite of nations&mdash;is rendered wretched as Jehovah&rsquo;s judgments come upon her (cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTAwLDE4MjcwXQ==\">Isaiah 24:4; 32:10<\/a>). <\/p> ",
