Does he think that they are boys just weaned, who are to be taught the first elements of the religion of the infant school?\u201d Then in their mockery they describe (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTc1XQ==\">Isaiah 28:10<\/a>) his teaching, with what was to them its wearisome iteration, \u201cAlways precept upon precept, line upon line . . .\u201d\u2014petty rebukes and puerile harping upon the same note, semper eandem canens cantilenam. We can scarcely doubt that Isaiah was indignantly reproducing, as St. Paul does in<a class=\"ref\">2 Corinthians 10:10; 2 Corinthians 11:16-17<\/a> ; the very words, almost the drunken accents, in which the priests and false prophets had spoken of him.<\/p> ",
