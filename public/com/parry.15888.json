    "html": " <i>darkness shall cover the earth.<\/i> Because of wickedness, hard-heartedness, false traditions, and apostasy from the true gospel, most of humanity has lost the spiritual light sent from the Lord. The Lord indicated in 1837 that such darkness prevailed on the earth at that time (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 112:23<\/a>). Joseph Smith said:<\/p> <p> \"Consider for a moment, brethren, the fulfillment of the words of the prophet; for we behold that darkness covers the earth, and gross darkness the minds of the inhabitants thereof\u2014that crimes of every description are increasing among men\u2014 vices of great enormity are practiced\u2014&hellip;intemperance, immorality, extravagance, pride, blindness of heart, idolatry, the loss of natural affection; the love of this world, and indifference toward the things of eternity increasing among those who profess a belief in the religion of heaven, and infidelity spreading itself in consequence of the same\u2014men giving themselves up to commit acts of the foulest kind, and deeds of the blackest dye, blaspheming, defrauding, blasting the reputation of neighbors, stealing, robbing, murdering; advocating error and opposing the truth, forsaking the covenant of heaven, and denying the faith of Jesus.\" <\/p> <p><i>Lord shall arise upon thee.<\/i> Even though darkness covers the earth and its people, there is one place where light will dawn: the latter-day Zion, God's dwelling place, which radiates his glory, or his goodness and peace. The contrast there between the worldly and the godly is clear for all to behold.<\/p> ",
