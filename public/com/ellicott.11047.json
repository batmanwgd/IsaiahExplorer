Here it would seem to be used for Lower Egypt, the region of Zoan and Memphis, as distinct from Upper Egypt or the Thebaid. The same form occurs in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 37:25<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\">2 Kings 19:24; Micah 7:12<\/a>. Its primary meaning is that of a fortified land. The \u201cflags\u201d are strictly the papyrus of the Nile; the \u201cbrooks\u201d are the canals or Nile-branches of the Delta.<\/p>",
