    "html": "<p>Jehovah&rsquo;s coming in a general sense&mdash;as distinct from his literal coming in person&mdash;refers to the entire scenario of his Day of Judgment that leads to his actual appearance. Called the &ldquo;day of power&rdquo; (<a class=\"ref\">Psalm 110:3<\/a>) and &ldquo;Day of Jehovah&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3OTEzLDE3OTE2XQ==\">Isaiah 13:6, 9<\/a>), there occurs a preparatory period entailing the earth&rsquo;s cleansing of the wicked and deliverance of the righteous that precedes Jehovah&rsquo;s millennial reign. Jehovah&rsquo;s &ldquo;work&rdquo; that ushers in his coming (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NTE5LDE4NTcxLDE4ODY2XQ==\">Isaiah 43:13; 45:9; 62:11<\/a>), in effect, involves the labors of both the king of Assyria\/Babylon and Jehovah&rsquo;s servant (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxNzg2M10seyIxODE4NiI6Mn0sWzE4NDg0XV0=\">Isaiah 10:12; 28:21-22; 42:3<\/a>).<\/p><p>The metaphor of Jehovah&rsquo;s <em>arm<\/em>&mdash;his end-time servant&mdash;signifies divine intervention. When Jehovah empowers his servant after he is ostracized (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODY0MV0seyIxODY0NCI6M30seyIxODY2OSI6NH0seyIxODcxMCI6M31d\">Isaiah 49:4, 7-9; 50:6-9; 52:13-15<\/a>), the tables turn for him and Jehovah&rsquo;s righteous people: &ldquo;Awake, arise; clothe yourself with power, O <em>arm<\/em> of Jehovah! Bestir yourself, as in ancient times, as in generations of old. Was it not you who carved up Rahab, you who slew the dragon? Was it not you who dried up the Sea, the waters of the mighty deep, and made of ocean depths a way by which the redeemed might pass&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODY4MyI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 51:9-10<\/a>; emphasis added; cf. 52:1-3).<\/p>",
