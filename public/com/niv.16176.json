    "html": "               <p>T<small>HESE VERSES ARE<\/small> something of a riddle because of the dramatic contrast between verses 14\u201316a and verses 16b\u201318a. Either one by itself can be justified in this passage without difficulty, but their juxtaposition causes a problem. The first segment speaks of overflowing shouts of \u201cjoy\u201d coming from the ends of the earth because of the \u201cglory\u201d and \u201cmajesty\u201d of the Lord. That is not out of place as a response to the righteous judgment of God (cf. 30:29\u201333). But this is immediately followed with an unidentified \u201cI\u201d (the prophet?) protesting that he is wasting away because of the \u201ctreachery\u201d and \u201cterror\u201d that characterize the earth.<\/p>     <p>\u2003What are we to make of this? The great variety of proposals and even the number of different readings in the versions prohibit any degree of dogmatism. But it seems most likely to me that the first segment is the cry of joy from those who have been oppressed by the evil earthcity. They are looking joyously at the end of the story. But the prophet cannot move so quickly beyond the present dark realities. He sees all the horrors that must take place before that final resolution, and he is stricken by them. We have seen this feature elsewhere in this book, beginning as early as the end of chapter 1. The prophet will not let the joyful promises of the future hide the awful present realities that must be dealt with before the promises can be realized.<\/p>     ",
