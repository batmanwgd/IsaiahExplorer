The allusion here is doubtless to the miraculous supply of water in the desert when the Israelites had come out of Egypt. God then supplied their needs; and in a similar manner he would always meet his people, and would supply their needs as if rivers of pure water were made to flow from dry and barren hills. <\/p> <p> <em>In high places <\/em>&mdash;The word used here denotes properly barrenness or nakedness <a class=\"ref\">Job 33:21<\/a>; and then a hill that is bare, or destitute of trees. It is applied usually to hills in a desert <a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 3:2, Jeremiah 3:21; Jeremiah 4:11; Jeremiah 7:29; Jeremiah 14:6<\/a>. Such hills, without trees, and in a dry and lonely desert, were of course usually without water. The idea is, that God would refresh them as if rivers were made to flow from such hills; and it may not improperly be regarded as a promise that God would meet and bless his people in situations, and from sources where they least expected refreshment and comfort. <\/p> <p> <em>And fountains in the midst of the valleys <\/em>&mdash;(See <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MjQzXQ==\">Isaiah 30:25<\/a>, note; <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MzI3XQ==\">Isaiah 35:6<\/a>, note). <\/p> <p> <em>I will make the wilderness <\/em>&mdash;(See the note at <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MzI4XQ==\">Isaiah 35:7<\/a>). <\/p>",
