The fugitives call on those rulers to plead for them and act as umpires, to be to them \u201cas the shadow of a great rock in a weary land\u201d (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 32:2<\/a>), black as night whilst the hot sun glares all around. Some critics, however, hold that the prophet still speaks to the Moabites and calls on them to protect the fugitives from Judah as they had done of old (<a class=\"ref\">Ruth 1:2; 1 Samuel 22:3<\/a>), and so to secure a return of like protection (Kay).<\/p>",
