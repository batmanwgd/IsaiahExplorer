    "html": "<p> And this relation He now renews. <em> \u201cFor Jehovah calleth thee as a wife forsaken and burdened with sorrow, and as a wife of youth, when once she is despised, saith thy God.\u201d<\/em> The verb \u05e7\u05e8\u05d0 , which is the one commonly used in these prophecies to denote the call of grace, on the ground of the election of grace, is used here to signify the call into that relation, which did indeed exist before, but had apparently been dissolved. \u05e7\u05e8\u05d0 \u05da is used here out of pause (cf., <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODMxXQ==\">Isaiah 60:9<\/a>); it stands, however, quite irregularly for the form in <em> e\u0304kh <\/em> , which is the one commonly employed (<a class=\"ref\">Judges 4:20; Ezekiel 27:26<\/a>). \u201cAnd as a wife:\u201d \u05d5\u05d0\u05e9\u05c1\u05ea is equivalent to \u05d5\u05bc\u05db\u05d0\u05e9\u05c1\u05ea . The hypothetical \u05ea\u05de\u05bc\u05d0\u05e1 \u05db\u05bc\u05d9 belongs to the figure. Jehovah calls His church back to Himself, as a husband takes back the wife he loved in his youth, even though he may once have been angry with her. It is with intention that the word \u05e0\u05de\u05d0\u05e1\u05d4 is not used. The future (imperfect) indicates what partially happens, but does not become an accomplished or completed fact: He is displeased with her, but He has not cherished aversion or hatred towards her.<\/p>",
