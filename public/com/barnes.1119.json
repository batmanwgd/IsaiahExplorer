This was the result in all countries where the Jews had a residence (compare the notes at <a class=\"ref\">Acts 2:9-11<\/a>).<\/p><p><em>And shall do sacrifice<\/em>&mdash;Shall offer sacrifices to Yahweh. They would naturally go to Jerusalem as often as practicable, and unite with the Jews there, in the customary rites of their religion.<\/p><p><em>And oblations<\/em>&mdash;The word \u05de\u05e0\u05d7\u05d4 minicha\u0304h &lsquo;oblation,&rsquo; denotes any offering that is not a &ldquo;bloody&rdquo; sacrifice&mdash;a thank-offering; an offering of incense, flour, grain, etc. (see the notes at <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc2NjgiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 1:13<\/a>) The sense is, that they should be true worshippers of God.<\/p><p><em>They shall vow a vow...<\/em>&mdash;They shall be sincere and true worshippers of God. The large numbers of the Jews that dwelt there; the fact that many of them doubtless were sincere; the circumstances recorded <a class=\"ref\">Acts 2:9-11<\/a>, that Jews were in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost; and the fact that the true religion was carried to Egypt, and the Christian religion established there, all show how fully this prediction was fulfilled.<\/p>",
