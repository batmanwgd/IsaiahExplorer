    "html": "<p> The prophecy is continued with the conjunction \u201cfor\u201d (<em> ci <\/em> ). The tacit link in the train of thought is this: they act thus in Babylon, because the destruction of Babylon is determined. The form in which this thought is embodied is the following: the prophet receives instruction in the vision to set a <em> m e tzappeh <\/em> upon the watch-tower, who was to look out and see what more took place. <em> \u201cFor thus said the Lord to me, Go, set a spy; what he seeth, let him declare.\u201d<\/em> In other cases it is the prophet himself who stands upon the watch-tower (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MDQ3XQ==\">Isaiah 21:11<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\">Habakkuk 2:1-2<\/a>); but here in the vision a distinction is made between the prophet and the person whom he stations upon the watch-tower (<em> specula <\/em> ). The prophet divides himself, as it were, into two persons (compare <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MDAyXQ==\">Isaiah 18:4<\/a> for the introduction; and for the expression \u201cgo,\u201d <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MDMyXQ==\">Isaiah 20:2<\/a>). He now sees through the medium of a spy, just as Zechariah sees by means of the angel speaking in him; with this difference, however, that here the spy is the instrument employed by the prophet, whereas there the prophet is the instrument employed by the angel.<\/p>",
