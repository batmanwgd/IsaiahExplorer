Upon Babylon, here called \"the desert of the sea,\" that it should be  destroyed by the Medes and Persians with a terrible destruction, which  yet God's people should have advantage by,   <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 21:1-10<\/a>.  II. Upon Dumah, or Idumea,   <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 21:11<\/a>.  III. Upon Arabia, or Kedar, the desolation of which country was very  near,   <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 21:13-17<\/a>.  These and other nations which the princes and people of Israel had so  much to do with the prophets of Israel could not but have something to  say to. Foreign affairs must be taken notice of as well as domestic  ones, and news from abroad enquired after as well as news at home.<\/p>",
