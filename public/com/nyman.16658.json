Isaiah also states that the lion (symbolizing carnivorous animals) will change its diet to that of cattle. There will be complete peace between man and animals, and also between the animals. President Joseph F. Smith taught that this enmity would cease if man would no longer seek to destroy the animals, and he cited the tame animals found in national parks as evidence (see <i>Gospel<\/i><i>Doctrine<\/i> (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1969], pp. 265-66). Of course, the outpouring of the glory of the Lord upon the earth will also further that ceasing of enmity, and the earth's being changed apparently will also have an effect.<\/p>     ",
