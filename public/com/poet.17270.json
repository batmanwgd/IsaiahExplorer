(NJV)<\/p> <p>The first verse serves as a simple prose introduction to the entire book of Isaiah. Since most ancient Hebrew scripture was written on parchment scrolls, an introduction like this was valuable so that a reader would not have to unroll the entire scroll in order to identify its author and subject matter. This short verse contains all the essential identifying information: the type of writing (\"vision,\" KJV, or \"prophecies,\" NJV), the author or source of the material (Isaiah), the primary subject matter (Judah and Jerusalem), and the period of composition (c. 750-690 B.C., during the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah).<\/p>",
