The Prophet promised the Saints that if they were faithful, their sufferings \"will be but a little season, and all these afflictions will be turned away from us.\" <\/p> <p><i>gather.<\/i> In the latter days, the Lord will gather Israel back into his fold as a shepherd gathers his sheep into the fold at night, or as a farmer gathers his crops into his barn at harvest time. The gathering will occur primarily through missionary work, as the Lord's servants range throughout the world seeking the honest in heart who will come unto Christ and his true Church. In addition to this gathering of hearts and souls, the Jews will gather to their land of promise in Palestine. It also appears that there will be a gathering of a large group of the ten tribes, who may return<i> en masse <\/i>from the land or lands of their exile (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 133:26-34<\/a>). <\/p> ",
