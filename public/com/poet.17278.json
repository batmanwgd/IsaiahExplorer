(See footnote 29a.)<\/p> <p>The terebinth is common in the eastern Mediterranean area and is used in landscaping either as a decorative windbreak or sunshield. It also yields a resinous sap from which turpentine is derived. Groves of terebinths were also used in pagan idol worship because, among other reasons, the pagans considered these evergreen trees to represent perpetual renewal and fertility. Thus, in Isaiah, groves of trees were often synonymous with idolatry.<\/p> <p>Therefore, when Isaiah says that the Israelites covet the terebinths, he is referring to either their coveting and yearning to have their yards and estates landscaped with groves of terebinths, or their desiring to use terebinths for places of idol worship. In either case, their longing for materialism or idolatry will result in drought and death, as seen in verse 30.<\/p> <p><a class=\"ref\">1 Ne. 1:11-14<\/a>).<\/p>",
