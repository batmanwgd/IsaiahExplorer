The two \u201chands\u201d are expressed by different words in the Hebrew, the second having the sense of the open palm of the hand. The \u201cnew crown,\u201d i.e., the new glory accruing to Jehovah from the restoration of Jerusalem, is not worn on the head (thought of, we may believe, as already crowned from eternity), but held forth in the hand for the gaze of the adoring nations.<\/p> ",
