When he heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah with this word: \u201cSay to Hezekiah king of Judah: Do not let the god you depend on deceive you when he says, \u2018Jerusalem will not be handed over to the king of Assyria.\u2019 Surely you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all the countries, destroying them completely. And will you be delivered? Did the gods of the nations that were destroyed by my forefathers deliver them\u2014the gods of Gozan, Haran, Rezeph and the people of Eden who were in Tel Assar? Where is the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad, the king of the city of Sepharvaim, or of Hena or Ivvah?\u201d<\/p>         <p>Hezekiah received the letter from the messengers and read it. Then he went up to the temple of the LORD and spread it out before the LORD. And Hezekiah prayed to the LORD: \u201cO LORD Almighty, God of Israel, enthroned between the cherubim, you alone are God over all the kingdoms of the earth. You have made heaven and earth. Give ear, O LORD, and hear; open your eyes, O LORD, and see; listen to all the words Sennacherib has sent to insult the living God.<\/p>         <p>\u201cIt is true, O LORD, that the Assyrian kings have laid waste all these peoples and their lands. They have thrown their gods into the fire and destroyed them, for they were not gods but only wood and stone, fashioned by human hands. Now, O LORD our God, deliver us from his hand, so that all kingdoms on earth may know that you alone, O LORD, are God.\u201d<\/p>         <p>Then Isaiah son of Amoz sent a message to Hezekiah: \u201cThis is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: Because you have prayed to me concerning Sennacherib king of Assyria, this is the word the LORD has spoken against him:<\/p>         <blockquote>             <p>\u201cThe Virgin Daughter of Zion<\/p>             <p>\u2003despises and mocks you.<\/p>             <p>The Daughter of Jerusalem<\/p>             <p>\u2003tosses her head as you flee.<\/p>             <p>Who is it you have insulted and blasphemed?<\/p>             <p>\u2003Against whom have you raised your voice<\/p>             <p>and lifted your eyes in pride?<\/p>             <p>\u2003Against the Holy One of Israel!<\/p>             <p>By your messengers<\/p>             <p>\u2003you have heaped insults on the Lord.<\/p>             <p>And you have said,<\/p>             <p>\u2003\u2018With my many chariots<\/p>             <p>I have ascended the heights of the mountains,<\/p>             <p>\u2003the utmost heights of Lebanon.<\/p>             <p>I have cut down its tallest cedars,<\/p>             <p>\u2003the choicest of its pines.<\/p>             <p>I have reached its remotest heights,<\/p>             <p>\u2003the finest of its forests.<\/p>             <p>I have dug wells in foreign lands<\/p>             <p>\u2003and drunk the water there.<\/p>             <p>With the soles of my feet<\/p>             <p>\u2003I have dried up all the streams of Egypt.\u2019<\/p>             <p>\u201cHave you not heard?<\/p>             <p>\u2003Long ago I ordained it.<\/p>             <p>In days of old I planned it;<\/p>             <p>\u2003now I have brought it to pass,<\/p>             <p>that you have turned fortified cities<\/p>             <p>\u2003into piles of stone.<\/p>             <p>Their people, drained of power,<\/p>             <p>\u2003are dismayed and put to shame.<\/p>             <p>They are like plants in the field,<\/p>             <p>\u2003like tender green shoots,<\/p>             <p>like grass sprouting on the roof,<\/p>             <p>\u2003scorched before it grows up.<\/p>             <p>\u201cBut I know where you stay<\/p>             <p>\u2003and when you come and go<\/p>             <p>\u2003and how you rage against me.<\/p>             <p>Because you rage against me<\/p>             <p>\u2003and because your insolence has reached my ears,<\/p>             <p>I will put my hook in your nose<\/p>             <p>\u2003and my bit in your mouth,<\/p>             <p>and I will make you return<\/p>             <p>\u2003by the way you came.<\/p>             <p>\u201cThis will be the sign for you, O Hezekiah:<\/p>             <p>\u201cThis year you will eat what grows by itself,<\/p>             <p>\u2003and the second year what springs from that.<\/p>             <p>But in the third year sow and reap,<\/p>             <p>\u2003plant vineyards and eat their fruit.<\/p>             <p>Once more a remnant of the house of Judah<\/p>             <p>\u2003will take root below and bear fruit above.<\/p>             <p>For out of Jerusalem will come a remnant,<\/p>             <p>\u2003and out of Mount Zion a band of survivors.<\/p>             <p>The zeal of the L<small>ORD<\/small> Almightywill<\/p>             <p>\u2003accomplish this.<\/p>         <\/blockquote>         <p>\u2003\u201cTherefore this is what the L<small>ORD<\/small> says concerning the king of Assyria:<\/p>         <blockquote>             <p>\u201cHe will not enter this city<\/p>             <p>\u2003or shoot an arrow here.<\/p>             <p>He will not come before it with shield<\/p>             <p>\u2003or build a siege ramp against it.<\/p>             <p>By the way that he came he will return;<\/p>             <p>\u2003he will not enter this city,\u201d<\/p>             <p>declares the L<small>ORD.<\/small><\/p>             <p>\u201cI will defend this city and save it,<\/p>             <p>\u2003for my sake and for the sake of David my servant!\u201d<\/p>         <\/blockquote>         <p>Then the angel of the LORD went out and put to death a hundred and eighty-five thousand men in the Assyrian camp. When the people got up the next morning\u2014there were all the dead bodies! So Sennacherib king of Assyria broke camp and withdrew. He returned to Nineveh and stayed there.<\/p>         <p>One day, while he was worshiping in the temple of his god Nisroch, his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer cut him down with the sword, and they escaped to the land of Ararat. And Esarhaddon his son succeeded him as king.<\/p>     <\/blockquote>                           <h4>Original Meaning<\/h4>                   <p>A<small>LTHOUGH SOME SCHOLARS<\/small> believe the material in 37:9\u201338 to be a second account of the same event narrated in 36:1\u201337:8, there are enough differences between the two to make that unlikely. In particular, we may note that the challenge has moved to focus exclusively on God\u2019s ability to deliver, that Hezekiah\u2019s own commitment seems much more forthright and direct, and that the oracle from God is much more forceful and direct. Motyer has proposed that Hezekiah, encouraged by Isaiah\u2019s words recorded in 37:6\u20137, has moved beyond a hesitant faith and responded to the field commander\u2019s challenge with the assertion that the Lord will deliver Jerusalem (cf. 37:10). Thus Sennacherib\u2019s letter is a response to Hezekiah, and Hezekiah\u2019s prayer is indicative of his now-total reliance on God. This seems a plausible explanation of the facts.<\/p>     ",
