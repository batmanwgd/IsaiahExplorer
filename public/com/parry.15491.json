    "html": " <p><i> Isaiah had a great understanding of the Savior and his mission. He knew that Jesus' mission would include serving the house of Israel, the Gentiles, those in spirit prison, and those who are spiritually and physically weak; he knew that Christ would not fail his mission (42:1-9). Isaiah also understood that Jesus is a mighty God, who will personally destroy all wickedness from off the face of the earth (42:10-17). As members of the Lord's church, we can understand these truths and receive a testimony of them. Knowledge of Jesus Christ and his gospel is not reserved for the prophets alone; it is also available to all who will seek.<\/i><\/p> ",
