The expressions of this and the following verse allude to the custom of the eastern countries, of having their thrashing-floors upon the tops of hills and mountains. <i>Thou shalt fan them <\/i>\u2014 When thou hast beaten them as small as chaff; <i>and the wind shall carry them away <\/i>\u2014 They shall no more molest thee; they shall be scattered and lost. <i>And thou shalt glory in the Holy One of Israel <\/i>\u2014 For to him, and not to thyself, thou shalt ascribe thy victory over thine enemies.<\/p>",
