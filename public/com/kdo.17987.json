For from Jerusalem will a remnant go forth, and a fugitive from Mount Zion; the zeal of Jehovah of hosts <\/em> (K.<em> chethib <\/em> omits<em> tsebha\u0302'o\u0304th <\/em> )<em> will carry this out.\u201d<\/em> The agricultural prospect of the third year shapes itself there into a figurative representation of the fate of Judah. Isaiah's watchword, \u201ca remnant shall return,\u201d is now fulfilled; Jerusalem has been spared, and becomes the source of national rejuvenation. You year the echo of <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzY0LDE3ODM2XQ==\">Isaiah 5:24; Isaiah 9:6<\/a>, and also of <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTU4XQ==\">Isaiah 27:6<\/a>. The word <em> ts e bha\u0302'o\u0304th <\/em> is wanting in Kings, here as well as in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MzcwXQ==\">Isaiah 37:17<\/a>; in fact, this divine name is, as a rule, very rare in the book of Kings, where it only occurs in the first series of accounts of Elijah (<a class=\"ref\">1 Kings 18:15; 1 Kings 19:10, 1 Kings 19:14<\/a>; cf., <a class=\"ref\">2 Kings 3:14<\/a>).<\/p>",
