That it stands rightly, or at least stood very early, in this place of the Version of the Septuagint, is highly probable, because it is acknowledged by the Arabic Version, and by the Coptic MS. St. Germain de Prez, Paris, translated likewise from the Septuagint. But whether it should be inserted, as of right belonging to the Hebrew text, may be doubted; for a transcriber of the Greek Version might easily add it by memory from the parallel place; and it is not necessary to the sense.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>From the time that it was \"Before the time when it began to exist\"\u2014<\/em>An ancient MS. has <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d4\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea\u05dd <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">heyotham<\/span>, \"they began to exist;\" and so another had it at first.

Cels. lib. 1.<\/p>\n\n<p>I have kept to the order of the words of the original, on purpose that the ambiguity, which Origen remarks in the Version of the Septuagint, and which is the same in the Hebrew might still remain; and the sense whlch he gives to it, be offered to the reader's judgment, which is wholly excluded in our translation.<\/p>",
