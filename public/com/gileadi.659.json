Those who don&rsquo;t call upon him are the Jacob\/Israel category and levels lower: &ldquo;I was available to those who did not inquire of me; I was accessible to those who did not seek me. I said, &lsquo;Here am I; I am here,&rsquo; to a nation that did not invoke my name&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODk5XQ==\">Isaiah 65:1<\/a> ; cf.<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NTI4XQ==\">43:22<\/a>). Those who call upon Jehovah emulate his servant: &ldquo;I have raised up one from the north who calls on my name&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDc3XQ==\">Isaiah 41:25<\/a> ; cf.<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODc0NSI6M30=\">55:4-6<\/a>). As they do so, Jehovah assures them &ldquo;he will graciously respond at the cry of your voice&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MjM3XQ==\">Isaiah 30:19<\/a> ; cf.<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4Mzk2XQ==\">38:5<\/a>).<\/p><p>The human virtues that define Jehovah&rsquo;s righteousness involve an entire paradigm shift away from tolerating servitude, abusiveness, offensive language, and all such symptoms of wickedness to serving others who are in need. With the advent of the servant&mdash;Jehovah&rsquo;s<em>light<\/em> (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4Nzk1XQ==\">v 8<\/a>)&mdash;those whose darkness turns to light live to see deliverance from<em>darkness<\/em> &mdash;the archtyrant: &ldquo;Arise, shine, your light has dawned; the glory of Jehovah has risen upon you! Although darkness covers the earth, and a thick mist the peoples, upon you Jehovah will shine; over you his glory shall be visible&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODgyMyI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 60:1-2<\/a> ; cf.<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzczOSI6Mn0=\">4:5-6<\/a>).<\/p> ",
