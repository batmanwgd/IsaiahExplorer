And perhaps the general truth is taught here, that the persecution of the people of God will be attended ultimately with a vast increase; and that all the attempts to obliterate the church will only tend finally to enlarge and strengthen it. <\/p> <p> <em>Shall say again in thy ears <\/em>&mdash;Or, shall say to thee. <\/p> <p> <em>The place is too strait for me <\/em>&mdash;There is not room for us all. The entire language here denotes a vast accession to the church of God. It is indicative of such an increase as took place when the gospel was proclaimed by the apostles to the Gentiles, and of such an increase as shall Yet more abundantly take place when the whole world shall become converted to God. <\/p> ",
