    "html": "<p><b>(<a class=\"ref\">2 Nephi 16:2-3<\/a>).<\/b>\"<i>The seraphims.<\/i>\" The Book of Mormon provides the correct rendering, \"seraphim.\" Seraph is singular and seraphs or seraphim plural. Perhaps these unusual six-winged creatures seen by Isaiah have some association with the strange beasts John the Revelator saw near the throne of God. (<a class=\"ref\">Revelation 4:2-10; 5:11-14<\/a>.) Joseph Smith explained that wings of the latter beasts \"are a representation of power, to move, to act, etc.\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 77:2-4<\/a>.) The Prophet further stated: \"John heard the words of the beasts giving glory to God, and understood them. God who made the beasts could understand every language spoken by them.\" (TPJS, 291-92.)<\/p>     <p>In his dedicatory prayer of the Kirtland Temple, the Prophet pleaded that the Saints might have power to \"mingle our voices with those bright, shining seraphs around thy throne, with acclamations of praise, singing Hosanna to God and the Lamb!\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 109:79<\/a>.) His description of \"shining seraphs\" is consistent with the Hebrew root of <i>seraph,<\/i> which is \"burning.\" Thus, seraphs are burning (shining) or fiery beings. (See LDSBD, \"Seraphim,\" p. 771.)<\/p>     <p>Joseph Smith described the heavenly messenger Moroni as having a \"countenance truly like lightning.\" (JS H 1:32.) Oliver Cowdery gave a similar description of the resurrected John the Baptist. (<a class=\"ref\">JS-H 1<\/a>: note, p. 59.) It seems logical that the \"seraphic hosts of heaven\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 38:1<\/a>) could be a combination of glorious, shining beings who represent saved beings from both the human and animal kingdoms. (See also DCE, 508-9.)<\/p>",
