Verses 15&ndash;16 refer to the destruction of the great army that will gather against Jerusalem just before the Millennium begins (compare <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODMwNSI6MTB9\">Isaiah 34:1&ndash;10<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 25:31&ndash;33; Ezekiel 38:17&ndash;23; 39:1&ndash;16; Joel 3:1&ndash;2, 11&ndash;14<\/a>; Enrichment I).<\/p><p>Zechariah taught that once the battle was over, those of the heathen nations who survived would eventually turn to Jehovah, and great holiness would prevail in Jerusalem or among God&rsquo;s people (see <a class=\"ref\">Zechariah 14:16&ndash;21<\/a>). This teaching closely parallels what Isaiah revealed here. The wicked will be gathered for destruction (see <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODkzOCI6NH0=\">Isaiah 66:15&ndash;18<\/a>), those who are scattered throughout the heathen nations (Tarshish, Pul, Lud, and so forth) will bring an offering to Jerusalem, and the holy people of God (see <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODk0MiI6NX0=\">vv. 19&ndash;23<\/a>) will marvel at what God has done to the wicked (see <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4OTQ3XQ==\">v. 24<\/a>).<\/p><p>Evidently many will then join the Church, for the Lord said He will take of the Gentiles &ldquo;for priests and for Levites&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4OTQ0XQ==\">v. 21<\/a>); in other words, they shall receive the priesthood.<\/p><p class=\"cite\">LDS Church Educational System Old Testament Student Manual, 1 Kings&ndash;Malachi, Religion 302, Chapter 18, Item 30<\/p>",
