Nephi, after quoting Isaiah's statement that \"the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord,\" explained that \"the things of all nations shall be made known; yea, all things shall be made known unto the children of men. There is nothing which is secret save it shall be revealed; there is no work of darkness save it shall be made manifest in the light; and there is nothing which is sealed upon the earth save it shall be loosed. Wherefore, all things which have been revealed unto the children of men shall at that day be revealed\" (<a class=\"ref\">2 Ne. 30:15-18<\/a>). <\/p> <p><i>as the waters cover the sea.<\/i> The sacred knowledge of God and his gospel will be as extensive as the waters that cover much of the earth's surface.<\/p> ",
