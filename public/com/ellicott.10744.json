    "html": " <p>,(15) When ye spread forth your hands.\u2014The words point to the attitude of one who prays, as was the manner of Jews, Greeks, and Romans (\u201ctenditque ad sidera palmas,\u201d Virg., \u00c6n., xii. 196), standing, and with hands stretched out toward heaven. (Comp. <a class=\"ref\">Luke 18:11-13<\/a>.) <\/p>\n <p>When ye make many prayers.\u2014The Pentateuch contains no directions for the use of forms of prayer beyond the benediction of <a class=\"ref\">Numbers 6:23-26<\/a>, and two forms connected with the Passover in <a class=\"ref\">Deuteronomy 26:5-10; Deuteronomy 26:13-15<\/a>. The \u201ceighteen prayers\u201d for daily use belong to the later Rabbinic stage of Judaism. It lies in the nature of the case, however, that first a real, and then an ostentatious devotion would show itself in the use of such forms, possibly, as in <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 119:164<\/a>, \u201cseven times a day.\u201d In <a class=\"ref\">Proverbs 27:14; Proverbs 28:9<\/a>, which belong to the reign of Hezekiah, and may, therefore, indirectly represent Isaiah\u2019s teaching, we have the warnings of the wise as to the right use of such forms. <\/p>\n <p>Your hands are full of blood.\u2014Literally, bloods, as implying many murderous acts. The words point to the guilt of judges and princes, such as that described in <a class=\"ref\">Hosea 4:2<\/a>. Life was sacrificed to greed of gain, or lust, or vindictiveness. To the prophet\u2019s eye those hands, stretched upwards in the Temple by some, at least, of the king\u2019s ministers and judges, were red with the blood of the slain. (Comp. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODA0XQ==\">Isaiah 59:3<\/a>.) <\/p>",
