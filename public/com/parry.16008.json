The verb in Hebrew means \"to excommunicate\" but also suggests \"to cast down\" or \"to reject.\" Those who treated the righteous in this manner will eventually \"be ashamed.\" The righteous here are being cast out \"for my name's sake\" or because of their fervent belief in the Lord. That is the lot of the righteous in all dispensations (<a class=\"ref\">Matt. 5:11-12<\/a>). <\/p> <p><i>Let the Lord be glorified.<\/i> These are not the true followers speaking here, rejoicing in their Lord; rather, they are the errant Israelites mocking their believing brethren. The prophet had earlier declared, \"The glory of the Lord shall be revealed\" (40:5), and the unbelievers were using these same words to jeer and ridicule those who indeed looked forward to Jehovah's intervention on their behalf (5:19). The wicked may actually believe they are doing God's will in casting out the righteous. They may be deceived into seeing evil as good and good as evil (5:20; <a class=\"ref\">Mal. 2:17<\/a>). <\/p> <p><i>he shall appear to your joy\/they shall be ashamed.<\/i> When the Lord comes again, the righteous will be filled with joy and the wicked (including the persecutors mentioned above) with great shame.<\/p> ",
