Joseph Smith, when he recalled the angel Moroni's visit on the night of 21 September 1823, wrote that Moroni \"quoted the eleventh chapter of Isaiah, saying that it was about to be fulfilled\" (<a class=\"ref\">JS-H 1:40<\/a>). These prophecies foretell that Jesus the Messiah will smite the earth and slay the wicked at his coming, preparing the way for the glorious Millennium, when he will rule with justice and righteousness.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>The final six verses of this chapter (11:11-16) also deal with us and are being fulfilled right now. The gospel ensign has been raised and Israel's exiles are gathering around it, events that constitute \"a marvelous work and a wonder\" (<a class=\"ref\">2 Ne. 25:17<\/a>). <\/i><\/p> ",
