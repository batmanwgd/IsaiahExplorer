    "html": "<p> Jeremiah says this with regard to the sacrifices (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODA1XQ==\">Isaiah 7:22<\/a>); Isaiah also applies it to visits to the temple: <em> \u201cWhen ye come to appear before my face, who hath required this at your hand, to tread my courts?\u201d<\/em> \u05dc\u05e8\u05d0\u05d5\u05ea is a contracted infinitive <em> niphal<\/em> for \u05dc\u05d4\u05e8\u05d0\u05d5\u05ea (compare the <em> hiphil<\/em> forms contracted in the same manner in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzE2LDE4MDg5XQ==\">Isaiah 3:8; Isaiah 23:11<\/a>). This is the standing expression for the appearance of all male Israelites in the temple at the three high festivals, as prescribed by the law, and then for visits to the temple generally (cf., <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 42:3; Psalms 84:8<\/a>). \u201cMy face\u201d (<em> panai <\/em> ): according to Ewald, \u00a7279, c, this is used with the passive to designate the subject (\u201cto be seen by the face of God\u201d); but why not rather take it as an adverbial accusative, \u201cin the face of,\u201d or \u201cin front of,\u201d as it is used interchangeably with the prepositions \u05dc , \u05d0\u05ea , and \u05d0\u05dc ? It is possible that \u05dc\u05e8\u05d0\u05d5\u05ea is pointed as it is here, and in <a class=\"ref\">Exodus 34:24<\/a> and in <a class=\"ref\">Deuteronomy 31:11<\/a>, instead of \u05dc\u05e8\u05d0\u05d5\u05ea - like \u05d9\u05e8\u05d0\u05d5\u05bc for \u05d9\u05e8\u05d0\u05d5\u05bc , in <a class=\"ref\">Exodus 23:15; Exodus 34:20<\/a>, - for the purpose of avoiding an expression which might be so easily misunderstood as denoting a sight of God with the bodily eye. But the <em> niphal<\/em> is firmly established in <a class=\"ref\">Exodus 23:17; Exodus 34:23<\/a>, and <a class=\"ref\">1 Samuel 1:22<\/a>; and in the Mishnah and Talmud the terms \u05e8\u05d0\u05d9\u05d4 and \u05e8\u05d0\u05d9\u05d5\u05df are applied without hesitation to appearance before God at the principal feasts. They visited the temple diligently enough indeed, but who had required <em> this<\/em> at their hand, i.e., required them to do this? Jehovah certainly had not. \u201c<em> To tread my courts<\/em> \u201d is in apposition to <em> this<\/em> , which it more clearly defines. Jehovah did not want them to appear before His face, i.e., He did not wish for this spiritless and undevotional tramping thither, this mere <em> opus operatum <\/em> , which might as well have been omitted, since it only wore out the floor.<\/p>",
