Those of such a spirit are those who come to Zion. If we are so blessed, we will feel God's love and care as a child feels the love and care of his mother.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>We are living in a day in which great prophecies are being fulfilled. We can see the Lord gathering his children from all parts of the world. Many of us may see the Lord come in his glory, though no man knows when that will be. Those who witness his coming will see the beginning of the millennial day, with the creation of a new heaven and a new earth. These are blessings to be sought in faith.<\/i><\/p> ",
