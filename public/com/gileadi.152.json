His claims show that in the course of committing global genocide he indeed conquers the world, establishing a one-world government or new world order.

He is the &ldquo;thief in the night&rdquo; who gathers up the world&rsquo;s wealth in the days just preceding Jehovah&rsquo;s coming (cf. <a class=\"ref\">Matthew 24:42-44; 1 Thessalonians 5:1-6; 2 Peter 3:10 <\/a>). <\/p> ",
