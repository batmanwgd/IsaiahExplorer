The country lay southeast of Palestine, with Moab on the north and the Dead Sea on the northwest. The Edomites and Israelites shared a mutual hatred of one another. Moab was southeast of the Dead Sea, and its citizens were constantly at war with the Israelites. The Ammonites were descendants of Abraham's nephew, Lot. Their country was located east of Mount Gilead, north of Moab. They were a constant irritant to the Israelites. The area occupied by the Edomites, Moabites, and Ammonites now comprises the country of modern Jordan. As noted above, Isaiah used the names of these countries to symbolize latter-day enemies of Israel.<\/p>",
