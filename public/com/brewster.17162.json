This will be called \"The way of holiness\" and \"the unclean shall not pass over it. . . .<\/p>     <p>\"And the ransomed of the Lord shall return, and come to Zion with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads: they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.\" (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODMyOSI6M30=\">Isaiah 35:8-10<\/a>.) This particular passage in Isaiah is cross-referenced with <a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 45:66-71<\/a>, which speaks of the New Jerusalem.<\/p>",
