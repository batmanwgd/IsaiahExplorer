He paints as not far off the restoration at once of the face of nature and of the life of man. Lebanon, that had been stripped of its cedars by the Assyrian invader (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODg1XQ==\">Isaiah 10:34<\/a>), so as to be as the wilderness of<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MDY4XQ==\">Isaiah 22:15<\/a> , should regain its glory, and once more be as Carmel, or \u201cthe fruitful field,\u201d while the fields that had rejoiced in the rich growth of herbage and shrubs should attain the greatness of the forests of Lebanon as they had been. (See<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4Mjc1XQ==\">Isaiah 32:15<\/a> , where \u201cthe wilderness\u201d answers to the \u201cLebanon\u201d of this verse.) The thought and the language would seem to have been among Isaiah\u2019s favourite utterances.<\/p> ",
