The word <i>wait<\/i> in Hebrew means hope for or anticipate. Nephi tells us that \"the people of the Lord are they who wait [hope] for him.\" (<a class=\"ref\">2 Nephi 6:13<\/a>.) Thus, one who waits upon the Lord places his trust in Him and lives in accordance with His will as he or she anticipates His coming. Such persons will have their \"confidence wax strong in the presence of God\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 121:45<\/a>), for they will have no unresolved sins to cause them to be ashamed.<\/p>",
