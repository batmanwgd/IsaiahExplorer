But what particular trees the Hebrew words here used signify is not certainly known. <i>That they may see <\/i>\u2014Or, <i>that men may see: <\/i> that all that see this wonderful change may consider it, and acknowledge that <i>the hand of the Lord hath done this \u2014 <\/i> That it is the work of God. \u201cThe many wonderful steps by which the restoration of the Jewish nation shall be brought about, will convince all considering persons that it is the work of God; and his power will still more undeniably discover itself in the propagation of the gospel, and the enlightening of those who sit in darkness with the saving truth of it.\u201d\u2014Lowth. <\/p> ",
