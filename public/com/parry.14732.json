    "html": " <p><i>This prophecy has a direct application for us although it was literally fulfilled when Assyria invaded ancient Israel. Assyria is a type and symbol of the warring nations that will exist in the latter days, shortly before the Second Coming. The text provides a number of clues regarding this, including Isaiah's fourfold use of the formula \"in that day\" (7:18, 20, 21, 23), a phrase that often pertains to our own day. Further, if we accept the Lord's sign of Immanuel (i.e., if we accept Jesus Christ and his atonement), we will be protected during the wars in the last days.The central messages for us in this section are that we should trust the Lord's word that comes through his prophet, rather than rely on the arm of flesh, and Judah's inhabitants should find comfort in knowing that a \"remnant of Israel shall return\" to Israel, as the Lord has promised.<\/i><\/p> ",
