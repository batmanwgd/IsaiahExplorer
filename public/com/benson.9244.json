Possibly he may say,<i> the altar,<\/i> with respect to that particular altar which Ahaz had set up in the place of God\u2019s altar; and this prophecy might be delivered in Ahaz\u2019s time, while that altar stood and was used. He seems to allude to Moses\u2019s showing his detestation of idolatry, by taking the golden calf, burning it, and grinding it to powder: and he intimates that when their repentance should be sincere, it would discover itself in a similar way. It must be observed, that of all sins, which are of a heinous nature, the Jews, till they were carried into captivity, were most inclined to idolatry, and for that sin especially, most of God\u2019s judgments, which they had hitherto suffered, had been inflicted upon them. But of that most unreasonable and wicked inclination they were in a great measure cured by that severe punishment, the seventy years captivity in Babylon.<i> The groves and images shall not stand up<\/i> \u2014 Shall be thrown down with contempt and indignation.<\/p> ",
