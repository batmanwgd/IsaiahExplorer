    "html": " <p>As the headnote to <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isa. 58<\/a> in the LDS edition of the Bible reads, 58:1-2 gives us the \"true law of the fast, with its attendant blessings.\" That fasting is more than going without food and drink for a period of time is made unmistakably clear.<\/p> <p>The passage opens with the Lord instructing Isaiah to proclaim the sins of the house of Israel (58:1), the people of the covenant both then and now, with boldness. They appear to be righteous, the Lord observes, being prayerful and obeying the ordinances of the gospel (58:2). Yet, as we soon learn, their righteousness is that of outward obedience only and not of the heart.<\/p> <p> Israel asks why the Lord has not blessed them for their sacrifice in fasting (58:3). The Lord answers that in their fasting they have not turned to him. They continue to seek pleasure and do business (58:3). They care more for the show of fasting\u2014to afflict their soul, to bow the head, to sit on sackcloth and ashes (58:5)\u2014than to attend to the true purposes of the fast: to help themselves and others to repent, to find respite from the emotional burdens they carry, and to help others with their problems and afflictions (58:6, 9-10). True fasting involves sharing with the hungry, the poor, and the naked, including needy members of one's own family (58:7, 10).<\/p> <p>Those who obey this law are promised great blessings, including spiritual light (58:8); physical health (58:8); increased righteousness (58:8); answers to prayer (58:9); continual guidance from the Lord (58:11); a plenitude of spiritual food and water, representing the full blessings of the Atonement, even when others lack (58:11); and a restoration of their lands of inheritance (58:12). This passage parallels 1:10-20, in which the Lord rebukes the people for outward obedience without a true yielding of the heart.<\/p> <blockquote> <i>Cry <\/i><u>aloud<\/u>, spare not,     <br><i>lift up thy voice<\/i> <u>like a trumpet<\/u>,     <br>and <i>[show]<\/i> <i>my people<\/i> <u>their transgression<\/u>,     <br>and the <i>house of Jacob <\/i> <u>their sins<\/u>. (58:1)     <br>Yet they <i>seek <\/i><u>me<\/u> daily,     <br>and <i>delight to know <\/i><u>my ways<\/u>,     <br>as a nation that <u>did righteousness<\/u>,     <br>and <u>forsook not the ordinance of their God<\/u>:     <br><i>they<\/i> <i>ask of me<\/i> the <u>ordinances of justice<\/u>;     <br><i>they<\/i> <i>take delight<\/i> in <u>approaching to God<\/u>. (58:2)     <br><i>Wherefore have we fasted,<\/i> say they, and <u>thou seest not<\/u>?     <br><i>wherefore have we afflicted our soul,<\/i> and <u>thou takest no knowledge<\/u>?     <br>Behold, in the day of your fast ye find pleasure, and exact all your labours. (58:3)     <br>Behold, <i>ye fast<\/i> <u>for strife and debate<\/u>, and to smite with the fist of wickedness:     <br><i>ye shall not fast<\/i> as<u> ye do this day<\/u>, to make your voice to be heard on high. (58:4)     <br>Is it such a fast that I have chosen?     <br>a day for a man to <i>afflict his soul?<\/i>     <br>is it to <i>bow down his head<\/i> as a bulrush,     <br>and to <i>spread sackcloth and ashes<\/i> under him?     <br>wilt thou call this <i>a fast,<\/i>     <br>and <i>an acceptable day<\/i> to the Lord? (58:5)     <br>Is not this the fast that I have chosen?     <br>to <i>loose<\/i> the <u>bands of wickedness<\/u>,     <br>to <i>undo<\/i> the <u>heavy burdens<\/u>,     <br>and to let the oppressed <u>go free<\/u>,     <br>and that <i>ye<\/i> <u>break every yoke<\/u>? (58:6)     <br>Is it not to <i>deal thy bread<\/i> to the <u>hungry<\/u>,     <br>and that <i>thou bring<\/i> the <u>poor<\/u> that are cast out to thy house?     <br>when thou<i> <\/i>seest the naked, that <i>thou<\/i> <u>cover him<\/u>;     <br>and that <i>thou<\/i><u> hide not thyself<\/u> from thine own flesh? (58:7)     <br>Then <u>shall<\/u> <i>thy light<\/i> <u>break forth<\/u> as the morning,     <br>and <i>thine health<\/i> <u>shall spring forth<\/u> speedily:     <br>and <i>thy righteousness<\/i> <u>shall go before thee<\/u>;     <br>the <i>glory of the Lord<\/i> <u>shall be thy [rear guard<\/u>]. (58:8)     <br>Then <i>shalt thou call,<\/i> and <u>the Lord shall answer<\/u>;     <br><i>thou shalt cry,<\/i> and <u>he shall say<\/u>,<u> Here I am<\/u>.     <br>If thou take away from the midst of thee the yoke, the putting forth of the finger, and speaking vanity; (58:9)     <br>And if thou <i>draw out thy soul<\/i> to <u>the hungry<\/u>,     <br>and <i>satisfy<\/i> <u>the afflicted soul<\/u>;     <br>then shall <i>thy light<\/i> rise in obscurity,     <br>and <i>thy darkness<\/i> be as the noonday: (58:10)     <br>And the Lord shall <i>guide <\/i><u>thee<\/u> continually,     <br>and<i> satisfy <\/i><u>thy soul<\/u> in drought,     <br>and <i>make fat <\/i><u>thy bones<\/u>:     <br>and thou shalt be <u>like a watered garden<\/u>,     <br>and <u>like a spring of water<\/u>, whose waters fail not. (58:11)     <br>And <i>they that shall be of thee<\/i> <i>shall build<\/i> the <u>old waste places<\/u>:     <br><i>thou<\/i> <i>shalt raise up <\/i>the <u>foundations<\/u> of many generations;     <br>and thou shalt be called, <i>The repairer<\/i> <u>of the breach<\/u>,     <br><i>The restorer<\/i> <u>of paths to dwell in<\/u>.
