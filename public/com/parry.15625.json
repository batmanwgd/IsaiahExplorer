As a slave, Babylon is forced to grind meal with hand stones, to remove her veil and expose herself to public view, to immodestly \"make bare the leg\" (47:2) so that her skirts don't obstruct her work, and so forth. It is also likely that slaves were poorly dressed and thus inadequately covered. Sitting in the dust was also a sign of mourning (3:26; <a class=\"ref\">Lam. 2:10; Ezek. 26:15-17<\/a>). This passage refers both to the captivity of the literal Babylon and Chaldea (seen through the eyes of prophecy) and to the loss of freedom and power suffered by those who belong to spiritual Babylon, which is the wicked world (contrast with 52:2).<\/p> <p><i>virgin daughter<\/i>. This term characterizes the offspring of Lady Babylon (the world). Even those who are young and seemingly innocent in Babylon will suffer the consequences of Babylon's downfall.<\/p> <p><i>Babylon<\/i>. <i>Babylon <\/i>is the world of wickedness, meaning those who live by a telestial law (<a class=\"ref\">Jer. 51:33-58; Zech. 2:7-9<\/a>). <\/p> <p><i>no throne<\/i>. Those who had ruled on thrones in the wicked world are now slaves. This phrase may be symbolic: those who were the leaders of society in the wicked world are thrown down.<\/p> <p><i>Chaldeans<\/i>. The <i>Chaldeans<\/i> were the learned class of Babylon, the magicians and sorcerers (see commentary on 43:14).<\/p> <p><i>tender\/delicate<\/i>.
