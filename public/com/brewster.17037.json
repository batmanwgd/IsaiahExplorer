He announces to this prophet of the restoration the coming forth of \"a marvelous work and a wonder\" in the latter days. It is of interest to note the similarity of these words recorded by Isaiah and Nephi anciently to those uttered by the Son of God in person to young Joseph Smith during what is known as the First Vision.
