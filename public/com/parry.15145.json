The humiliation is seen to be even greater when we read that the feet that do the trampling are those of the ones who themselves had been oppressed. They are the needy and poor, who formerly had suffered from those who dwelt in the high city. Isaiah's figure shows the complete defeat of the enemies of God's kingdom and the full exaltation of those who in the eyes of the world were regarded as insignificant and poor, and who had suffered at the hands of unjust oppressors.\" <\/p> <p> <i>poor\/needy. <\/i>These words may be taken literally; or they may speak of them who can rely only on the Lord for strength (25:4).<\/p> ",
