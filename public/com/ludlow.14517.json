    "html": "<p>Isaiah describes the remaining righteous who will be spared from the Lord&rsquo;s punishments in the last days. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzY1NiI6MzF9\">Verses 3<\/a> and 4 praise those who are &ldquo;left in Zion and remain in Jerusalem.&rdquo; This describes both the chosen people of the Old World (in Jerusalem), and the people of the New World, living in Zion (the New Jerusalem). As members of the stakes of Zion, we are included in the Lord&rsquo;s assurance of protection (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 68:26; 107:36; 109:59<\/a>).<\/p>\r\n<p>Contrasting images of cleansing (water) and burning (fire) are presented in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzY1NiI6MzF9\">verse 4<\/a> as the Savior &ldquo;wash[es] away the filth&rdquo; of the people in Jerusalem and purges them &ldquo;by the spirit of burning.&rdquo; Both actions denote a purification of the body, but one implies physical cleansing while the other suggests spiritual cleansing. Through the gift of the Atonement, the Savior cleanses those who come unto Him &ldquo;by the spirit of judgment&rdquo; and purges those worthy of His grace with &ldquo;the spirit of burning&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzM4XQ==\">v. 4<\/a>). Isaiah&rsquo;s description of cleansing and purging also alludes to the ancient Jewish sacrificial traditions in which burnt animal sacrifices were washed and purged of blood before they were offered to the Lord as a burnt offering (<a class=\"ref\">Leviticus 1:9, 13<\/a>). Symbolic washing and cleansing from the blood and sins of this telestial life are also experienced in our temples as we prepare to enter God&rsquo;s celestial realms.<\/p>",
