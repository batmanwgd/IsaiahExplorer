The term &ldquo;whip&rdquo; or &ldquo;scourge&rdquo; (<em>sot<\/em>) alludes to Gideon&rsquo;s thrashing his enemies with a flagellum of briars and thorns (<a class=\"ref\">Judges 8:16<\/a>). In an end-time version of these events, the <em>whip<\/em>&mdash;Jehovah&rsquo;s servant&mdash;defeats an Assyrian army in a similar victory against overwhelming odds (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxNzgzNF0seyIxODI0OCI6M31d\">Isaiah 9:4; 30:30-32<\/a>).
