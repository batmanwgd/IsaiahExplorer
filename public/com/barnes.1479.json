The meaning here is, that the army should not be permitted to come before the city defended with shields, and prepared with the means of attack and defense. <\/p> <p> <em>Nor cast a bank against it <\/em>&mdash;A mound; a pile of earth thrown up in the manner of a fort to defend the assailants, or to give them an advantage in attacking the walls. Sieges were conducted by throwing up banks or fortifications, behind which the army of attack could be secure to carry on their operations. Towers filled with armed men were also constructed, covered with hides and other impenetrable materials, which could be made to approach the walls, and from which those who were within could safely conduct the attack. <\/p> ",
