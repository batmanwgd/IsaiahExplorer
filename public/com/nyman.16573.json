    "html": "          <p>These two verses demonstrate that what the Lord said in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 51<\/a> was addressed to the two gathering places of Zion and Jerusalem. Jacob included them as the conclusion of his quotation from Isaiah (see <a class=\"ref\">2 Ne. 8:24-25<\/a>). They are also quoted in two other places in the Book of Mormon. When the Savior visited the Nephites, he specified that these verses would be fulfilled when the Jews were gathered to Jerusalem in the last days. He also added one word to the text which was not quoted by Jacob: \"Awake, awake <i>again,<\/i> and put on thy strength, O Zion\" (<a class=\"ref\">3 Ne. 20:36-37<\/a>). This was probably because Zion, or America, was \"awakening\" at the time of the Savior's visit and \"putting on her strength,\" but the Savior knew that within 400 years the Nephites would lose that strength and fall again into a spiritual sleep. The use of the word \"again\" indicates a dual interpretation of the Isaiah text in this instance, and supports the idea that there are other dual interpretations throughout Isaiah. Moroni, in his final admonition, paraphrased these verses as prophecy which would be fulfilled (see <a class=\"ref\">Moro. 10:31<\/a>).<\/p>     <p>In March 1838, the Prophet Joseph Smith gave the following interpretation of these verses in answer to a question about what Isaiah meant by \"Put on thy strength, O Zion\":<\/p>     <p>He had reference to those whom God should call in the last days, who should hold the power of priesthood to bring again Zion, and the redemption of Israel; and to put on her strength is to put on the authority of the priesthood, which she, Zion, has a right to by lineage; also to return to that power which she had lost. (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 113:8<\/a>.) <\/p>     <p>He also gave the meaning of \"Zion loosing herself from the bands of her neck\":<\/p>     <p>We are to understand that the scattered remnants are exhorted to return to the Lord from whence they have fallen; which if they do, the promise of the Lord is that he will speak to them, or give them revelation. See the 6th, 7th, and 8th verses. The bands of her neck are the curses of God upon her, or the remnants of Israel in their scattered condition among the Gentiles. (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 113:10<\/a>.)<\/p>     <p><a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 82:14<\/a> also declares that \"Zion must arise and put on her beautiful garments.\"<\/p>     ",
