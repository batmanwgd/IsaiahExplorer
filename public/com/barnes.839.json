    "html": "<p><em>I will lay it waste...<\/em>&mdash;The description here is continued from <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 5:5<\/a>. The image is carried out, and means that the Jews should be left utterly without protection.<\/p><p><em>I will also command the clouds...<\/em>&mdash;It is evident here, that the parable or figure is partially dropped. A farmer could not command the clouds. It is God alone who could do that; and the figure of the vineyard is dropped, and God is introduced speaking as a sovereign. The meaning is, that he would withhold his divine influences, and would abandon them to desolation. The sense of the whole verse is plain. God would leave the Jews without protection; he would remove the guards, the helps, the influences, with which he had favored them, and leave them to their own course, as a vineyard that was unpruned, uncultivated, unwatered. The Chaldee has well expressed the sense of the passage: &lsquo;I will take away the house of my sanctuary (the temple), and they shall be trodden down. I will regard them as guilty, and there shall be no support or defense for them; they shall be abandoned, and shall become wanderers. I will command the prophets, that they shall not prophesy over them.&rsquo; The lesson taught here is, that when a people become ungrateful, and rebellious, God will withdraw from them, and leave them to desolation; compare <a class=\"ref\">Revelation 2:3<\/a>.<\/p>",
