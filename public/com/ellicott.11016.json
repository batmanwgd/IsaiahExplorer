Others, with a different derivation, make it \u201ccity of the sun.\u201d Others, again (E. H. Palmer, in the Athen\u00e6um of August 19, 1871), connect it with h\u00e1reith, the modern Moabite name for the hillocks on which the rock fortresses were built. The word for foundations occurs in <a class=\"ref\">Hosea 3:1<\/a>, for raisin-cakes (\u201cflagons of wine\u201d in the Authorised version (comp. <a class=\"ref\">2 Samuel 6:19<\/a>, Song <a class=\"ref\">Song of Solomon 2:5<\/a>), and has been supposed to refer to this as the main product of Kir-hareseth, the traffic in which she lost through the destruction of the vineyards, mentioned in the next verse. Ruins would, in any case, be better than \u201cfoundations.\u201d <\/p>",
