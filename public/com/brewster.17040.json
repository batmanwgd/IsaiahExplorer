Such precepts are not based on the \"living water\" of gospel truths but rather leave men either thirsting or spiritually poisoned from their ill effects. (<a class=\"ref\">John 4:10-14<\/a>.) Precepts of men are false doctrines that cause men to err, to fail to recognize the truth, and to deny the power of God.
