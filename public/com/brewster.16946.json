They were not only places of entrance and exit, but also served as places of private and public business transactions. The gates were often taken as representing the city itself. (See the commentary on <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzM0XQ==\">Isaiah 3:26<\/a>.) In the Isaiah context, the meaning is probably an invitation for those who are fleeing Babylon to enter the holy cities of Jerusalem and Zion (the new Jerusalem). (See <a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 133:12-14<\/a>.)<\/p>",
