(NIV)<\/p> <p>A. Israel's rival is destroyed.<\/p> <p>B. Her people are gone.<\/p> <p>C. Fortified places and powers will cease.<\/p> <\/blockquote><p>The cities of \"Aroer\" (v. 2) are also known as the cities of the \"junipers.\" At least four places have this name in the Old Testament. One is in Moab (see map earlier in this chapter), although the Aroer mentioned here is in the territory of Damascus. \"Aram\" (v. 3) is another name for Syria. (See BD \"Aram, Aramaeans\"; \"Syria.\") It is the valley wherein Damascus lies.<\/p>",
