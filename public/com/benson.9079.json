We have here the fourth evil charged on the people, and the punishment of it. The sin complained of is the injustice of the magistrates and judges, who<i>decreed unrighteous decrees<\/i>\u2014That is, made unjust laws, and gave forth unjust sentences, which is termed in the next clause, <i>writing grievousness,<\/i> or grievous things, edicts which caused grief and vexation to their subjects. <i>To turn aside the needy from judgment \u2014<\/i> From obtaining a just sentence, because these rulers and judges either denied or delayed to hear their causes, or when they heard them decided unjustly;<i>to take away the right from the poor \u2014<\/i> Whom I have, in a special manner, committed to your care;<i>of my people<\/i>\u2014Whom I had taken into covenant with myself; and therefore this is an injury, not only to them, but also to me. The punishment assigned to this iniquity is, that they should be absolutely deserted and deprived of all help and protection from God, whose laws they had so shamefully perverted; and should perish miserably before their enemies, who should come from far.<\/p> ",
