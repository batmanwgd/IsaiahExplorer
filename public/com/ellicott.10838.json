The words seem to point to the prophet\u2019s position as in front of the Holy of holies. <\/p>\n <p>The house was filled with smoke.\u2014The vision had its prototype in \u201cthe smoke as of a furnace\u201d on Sinai (<a class=\"ref\">Exodus 19:18<\/a>), in the glory-cloud of <a class=\"ref\">1 Kings 8:10<\/a>, and possibly in its lurid fire-lit darkness represented the wrath of Jehovah, as the clear brightness of the throne did His love. So in <a class=\"ref\">Revelation 15:8<\/a>, the \u201csmoke from the glory of God\u201d precedes the outpouring of the seven vials of wrath\u2019. The parallelism of the clouds of incense-smoke as the symbol of adoring prayer (<a class=\"ref\">Revelation 5:8; Revelation 8:4<\/a>) suggests an alternative interpretation as possible; but in that case mention would probably have been made of the censers from which it rose. The incense-clouds of the Temple may in either case have been the starting-point of the mystic vision. <\/p>",
