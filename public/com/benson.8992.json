Vitringa is of opinion, that the prophet here alludes immediately to the kings of Egypt: see<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MjU0XQ==\">Isaiah 31:3<\/a> . And he adds, that the mystical interpretation of the period from the twelfth to this verse, may refer also to other days of the divine judgment, of which there are four peculiarly noted in Scripture, as referring to the new economy. 1st, The day of the subversion of the Jewish republic; 2d, The day of vengeance on the governors of the Roman empire, the persecutors of the church, in the time of Constantine; 3d, The future day of judgment hereafter to take place upon Antichrist and his crew; of which the prophets, and St. John in the Revelation particularly, have spoken; and, 4th, The day of general judgment. It is to this<i> third<\/i> day that he thinks the present period more immediately refers: see<a class=\"ref\">2 Thessalonians 2:2; Revelation 16:14<\/a> .\u201d \u2014 Dodd.<\/p> ",
