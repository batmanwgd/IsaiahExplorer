Or the meaning may be, <i>therefore, <\/i> for the sake of Abraham and of that covenant which God made with him, and by which he promised to bless him and his seed for ever; <i>the Lord shall comfort Zion <\/i>\u2014His church, frequently, as we have seen, called by that name. <i>He will make her wilderness like Eden <\/i>\u2014Although she may be waste and desolate like a wilderness or desert for a time, yet she shall be restored and made as pleasant and flourishing as the garden of Eden was. The expressions are figurative, and, according to Vitringa, \u201cin their primary sense, refer to the state of Zion after their restoration from Babylon; in their secondary and spiritual sense, to the redemption of the church by the Messiah, and the consequent blessings of grace.\u201d See <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NjU2LDE4NzA2XQ==\">Isaiah 49:19; Isaiah 52:9<\/a>. <\/p> ",
