It does seem possible to see certain groupings. We began with the Mesopotamian powers of Babylon and Assyria (chs. 13\u201314) and then moved to the neighbors Philistia, Moab, Aram, and Israel (chs. 14\u201317). Chapter 18 formed an interlude chapter, where Ethiopia was used to focus on the lordship of Yahweh over all nations. Then came the oracle against Egypt (chs. 19\u201320).<\/p>     <p>\u2003But what about the remaining chapters? Some scholars believe that the four oracles in chapters 21 and 22 should be considered together, but the reasons given vary. Most comment on the prophet\u2019s clear sense of grief over what he sees happening. Many also observe the enigmatic titles of the first, second, and fourth oracles. I have proposed that the first refers to Babylon, while the second, third, and fourth all refer to Arabia, who will be failed by it.<\/p>     ",
