They are consumed in their wickedness and will forfeit the blessings that might have been theirs. They will be brought to the depths of personal suffering and sorrow. When they are brought to a realization, or, perhaps better said, an <i>admission<\/i> of what they have done, they may well cry out: \"For our words will condemn us, yea, all our works will condemn us; we shall not be found spotless; and our thoughts will also condemn us; and in this awful state we shall not dare to look up to our God; and we would fain be glad if we could command the rocks and the mountains to fall upon us to hide us from his presence.\" (<a class=\"ref\">Alma 12:14<\/a>.) Their torment will feel like a consuming, \"unquenchable fire.\" (See <a class=\"ref\">Mosiah 2:37-38<\/a>.)<\/p>",
