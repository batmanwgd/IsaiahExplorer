    "html": " <p><i> Isaiah presents three images of Jesus Christ that have special meaning for us today\u2014 water, temple, and light. First, Jesus is as essential to our spiritual salvation as water is to our physical salvation; that is to say, without water we will die physically, and without Christ we will die spiritually (8:5-10). Second, we will find peace and comfort in Jesus Christ if we permit him to be our temple (the focus of our worship), our cornerstone (the chief part of the building), and our sure foundation (where we can find sure footing) (8:11-15). Third, as we walk through mortality, which is like passing in the shadow or in darkness, we receive great hope, comfort, and joy when we accept Jesus as our \"great light\" (8:16-9:2).<\/i><\/p> ",
