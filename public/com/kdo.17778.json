    "html": "<p><em> \u201cThy pomp is cast down to the region of the dead, the noise of thy harps: maggots are spread under thee, and they that cover thee are worms.\u201d<\/em> From the book of Daniel we learn the character of the Babylonian music; it abounded in instruments, some of which were foreign. Maggots and worms (a bitter sarcasm) now take the place of the costly artistic Babylonian rugs, which once formed the pillow and counterpane of the distinguished corpse. \u05d9\u05e6\u05bc\u05e2 might be a third pers. <em> hophal<\/em> (Ges. \u00a771); but here, between perfects, it is a third pers. <em> pual<\/em> , like <em> yullad <\/em> in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODM1XQ==\">Isaiah 9:5<\/a>. <em> Rimma\u0302h <\/em> , which is preceded by the verb in a masculine and to a certain extent an indifferent form (Ges. \u00a7147,<em> a<\/em> ), is a collective name for small worms, in any mass of which the individual is lost in the swarm. The passage is continued with \u05d0\u05d9 \u05da (on which, as a catchword of the <em> mashal <\/em> , see at <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3Njc2XQ==\">Isaiah 1:21<\/a>).<\/p>",
