    "html": " <p>The spiritual level of &ldquo;seraphs&rdquo; (<em>serapim <\/em>) in the Book of Isaiah appears directly below that of Jehovah, as it does here. The fact that Isaiah sees Jehovah, on the other hand, identifies him with Isaiah&rsquo;s son\/servant category, immediately below that of seraphs. Together, these three spiritual levels constitute the highest in the Book of Isaiah&rsquo;s hierarchy of seven. Later, after ministering as a prophet for more than forty years, Isaiah himself assumes the role of a seraph. The seraphs&rsquo; &ldquo;wings&rdquo; or &ldquo;veils&rdquo; (<em>kenapayim <\/em>) perhaps consist of energy fields that enable them to move or conceal themselves at will. <\/p> ",
