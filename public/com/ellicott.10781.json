    "html": "<p> (22) Cease ye from man . . .\u2014The verse is wanting in some MSS. of the LXX. version, and is rejected by some critics, as of the nature of a marginal comment, and as not in harmony with the context. The first fact is the most weighty argument against it, but is not decisive. The other objection does not count for much. To \u201ccease from man\u201d as well as from \u201cidols\u201d is surely the natural close of the great discourse which had begun with proclaiming that men of all classes and conditions should be brought low. The words \u201cwhose breath is in his nostrils\u201d emphasise the frailty of human life (<a class=\"ref\">Genesis 2:7; Genesis 7:22; Psalms 146:3-4<\/a>). Looking to that frailty, the prophet asks, as the psalmist had asked, \u201cWhat is man? (<a class=\"ref\">Psalms 8:1<\/a>). What is he to be valued at?\u201d If it could be proved that the verse was not Isaiah\u2019s, it is at least the reflection of a devout mind in harmony with his.<\/p> ",
