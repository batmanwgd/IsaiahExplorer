    "html": "<p><em>Bind them on thee, as a bride doeth \"Bind them about thee, as a bride her jewels\"\u2014<\/em> The end of the sentence is manifestly imperfect. Does a bride bind her children, or her new subjects, about her? Sion clothes herself with her children, as a bride clothes herself, - with what? some other thing certainly. The Septuagint help us out in this difficulty, and supply the lost word:<span class=\"greek-hebrew\"> \u03c9\u0314\u03c2 \u03ba\u03bf\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd \u03bd\u03c5\u03bc\u03c6\u03b7\u0387<\/span> as a bride her ornaments. <span class=\"greek-hebrew\"> \u05db\u05dc\u05d4 \u05db\u05db\u05dc\u05d9\u05d4<\/span><span class=\"translit\"> kichleyha callah<\/span> , or<span class=\"greek-hebrew\"> \u05db\u05dc\u05d9\u05d4 \u05db\u05db\u05dc\u05d4<\/span><span class=\"translit\"> kecallah keleyha<\/span> . The great similitude of the two words has occasioned the omission of one of them. See <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODU0XQ==\">Isaiah 61:10<\/a>.<\/p> ",
