In contrast to those who fast according to the law but not with purity of heart, we must keep the law of the Sabbath with \"delight\" (58:13). If we keep the Sabbath with such an attitude, we will \"delight\" ourselves in the Lord (58:14). The Lord will then give us high and lofty blessings, even those promised to \"Jacob thy father\" (58:14).<\/p> <blockquote> If <i>thou turn away thy foot<\/i> from the <u>sabbath<\/u>,     <br>from <i>doing thy pleasure<\/i> on my<u> holy day<\/u>;     <br>and call the sabbath <i>a delight,<\/i>     <br>the <i>holy of the Lord,<\/i>     <br><i>honourable;<\/i> and shalt honour him,     <br><i>not doing<\/i> <u>thine own ways<\/u>,     <br><i>nor finding<\/i> <u>thine own pleasure<\/u>,     <br><i>nor speaking<\/i> <u>thine own words <\/u>: (58:13)     <br>Then shalt thou delight thyself in the Lord;     <br>and I will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth,     <br>and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father:     <br>for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.
