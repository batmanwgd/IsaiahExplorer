This was a period of extensive government programs but of moral decline that set the stage for Assyria&rsquo;s invasion and conquest of Egypt. Like ancient Egypt, end-time &ldquo;Egypt&rdquo; deteriorates politically (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODAxNiI6NX0=\">vv 11-15 <\/a>), experiences economic hardship (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODAxMyI6M30=\">vv 8-10 <\/a>), and suffers severe drought conditions (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODAxMCI6M30=\">vv 5-7 <\/a>). Egypt&mdash;the breadbasket of the world&mdash;is reduced to poverty. Only the God of Israel, who rules over all nations, is able to save Egypt (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODAyNSI6NX0=\">vv 20-24 <\/a>). <\/p> ",
