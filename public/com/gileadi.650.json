    "html": "<p>Contrasting those who perish with the wicked are persons &ldquo;who seek refuge in me,&rdquo; who inherit the earth: &ldquo;You were a refuge for the poor, a shelter for the needy in distress&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgxMjMiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 25:4<\/a>; cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgxNTciOjJ9XQ==\">27:5-6<\/a>); &ldquo;Your entire people shall be righteous; they shall inherit the earth forever&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg4NDMiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 60:21<\/a>; cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgzMDAiOjF9XQ==\">33:20<\/a>). The &ldquo;road,&rdquo; &ldquo;way,&rdquo; or &ldquo;path&rdquo; to Jehovah&rsquo;s holy mountain takes the form of a new exodus of his righteous people to Zion (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgxNjQiOjJ9LHsiMTgyNDciOjF9LHsiMTgzMjkiOjN9LHsiMTg1MjUiOjN9LHsiMTg2NDgiOjJ9LHsiMTg5NDMiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 27:12-13; 30:29; 35:8-10; 43:19-21; 49:11-12; 66:20<\/a>). Jehovah&rsquo;s servant&mdash;his <em>voice<\/em> and <em>mouth<\/em>&mdash;announces that the time has arrived to &ldquo;prepare the way&rdquo; for Jehovah&rsquo;s coming:<\/p><p>&ldquo;A voice calls out, &lsquo;In the desert prepare the way for Jehovah; in the wilderness pave a straight highway for our God: every ravine must be raised up, every mountain and hill made low; the uneven ground must become level and rough terrain a plain. For the glory of Jehovah shall be revealed and all flesh see it at once.&rsquo; By his mouth Jehovah has spoken it&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg0MjQiOjN9XQ==\">Isaiah 40:3-5<\/a>). Certain &ldquo;obstacles&rdquo; or &ldquo;stumbling-blocks (<em>miksol<\/em>) of a spiritual nature, however&mdash;including common &ldquo;stones&rdquo; or unrepentant sinners&mdash;still prevent Jehovah from coming. They now receive the chance to repent or be removed:<\/p><p>&ldquo;Pass on, go through gates; prepare the way for the people! Excavate, pave a highway cleared of stones; raise the ensign to the nations! Jehovah has made proclamation to the end of the earth: Tell the Daughter of Zion, &lsquo;See, your Salvation comes, his reward with him, his work preceding him&rsquo;&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg4NjUiOjJ9XQ==\">Isaiah 62:10-11<\/a>). The servant&rsquo;s preparing the way before Jehovah&rsquo;s coming leads to the formation of a holy people called Zion who take refuge in a place called Zion: &ldquo;He will come as Redeemer to Zion, to those of Jacob who repent of transgression&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg4MjEiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 59:20<\/a>; cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc3MzYiOjV9LHsiMTc5MDciOjF9LHsiMTc5NjEiOjF9LHsiMTgxMTkiOjF9LHsiMTg1OTgiOjN9XQ==\">4:2-6; 12:6; 14:32; 24:23; 46:11-13<\/a>).<\/p>",
