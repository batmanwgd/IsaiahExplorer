    "html": "<p><i>And the strong<\/i> \u2014Those who have been thought to be strong, on whom the people relied for protection and defense\u2014their rulers, princes, and the commanders of their armies.<\/p><p><i>As tow<\/i> \u2014The coarse or broken part of flax, or hemp. It means here that which shall be easily and quickly kindled and rapidly consumed. As tow burns and is destroyed at the touch of fire, so shall the rulers of the people be consumed by the approaching calamities. <p><i>And the maker of it<\/i> \u2014This is an unhappy translation. The word \u05e4\u05e2\u05dc\u05d5 po\u201ba\u0306lo\u0302 may be indeed a participle, and be rendered \u2018its maker,\u2019 but it is more commonly a noun, and means his work, or his action. This is its plain meaning here. So the Latin Vulgate, the Septuagint, and the Chaldee. It means, that as a spark enkindles tow, so the works or deeds of a wicked nation shall be the occasion or cause of their destruction. The ambition of one man is the cause of his ruin; the sensuality of a second is the cause of his; the avarice of a third is the cause of his. These passions, insatiable and ungratified, shall be the occasion of the deep and eternal sorrows of hell. So it means here, that the crimes and hypocrisy of the nation would be the real cause of all the calamities that would come upon them as a people. <p><i>Shall both burn together<\/i> \u2014The spark and the flame from the kindled flax mingle, and make one fire. So the people and their works would be enkindled and destroyed together. They would burn so rapidly, that nothing could extinguish them. The meaning is, that the nation would be punished; and that all their works of idolatry and monuments of sin would be the occasion of their punishment, and would perish at the same time. The \u201cprinciple\u201d involved in this passage teaches us the following things:<p>(1) That the wicked, however mighty, shall be destroyed. <p>(2) That their works will be the \u201ccause\u201d of their ruin\u2014a cause necessarily leading to it. <p>(3) That the works of the wicked\u2014all that they do and all on which they depend\u2014shall be destroyed. <p>(4) That this destruction shall be final. Nothing shall stay the flame. No tears of penitence, no power of men or devils, shall \u201cput out\u201d the fires which the works of the wicked shall enkindle. <p><\/div> ",
