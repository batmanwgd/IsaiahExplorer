    "html": " <p>This is the longest proper name in the Bible, and in the Hebrew it has a meaning that was a message of warning to Judah. The name means &ldquo;to speed the spoil, he hasteneth the prey&rdquo; (see <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODA5XQ==\">Isaiah 8:1 <em>d <\/em><\/a>). The Lord commanded the prophet to give this name to his newborn son. The expression &ldquo;prophetess&rdquo; is used here only to designate the prophet&rsquo;s wife, not a prophetic office or gift (see Young, <em>Book of Isaiah, <\/em> 1:303). This son and Shear-jashub were both given prophetic names to dramatize Isaiah&rsquo;s message.
