Even Sabbath meetings aren&rsquo;t acceptable when they don&rsquo;t spring from personal righteousness: &ldquo;As for convening meetings at the New Month and on the Sabbath, wickedness with the solemn gathering I cannot approve&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NjY4XQ==\">Isaiah 1:13 <\/a>). What characterizes Jehovah&rsquo;s servants is that they keep the Sabbath Day holy (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzYwXQ==\">Isaiah 56:6 <\/a>). As a &ldquo;sign&rdquo; between Jehovah and his people (<a class=\"ref\">Exodus 31:13; Ezekiel 20:12, 20 <\/a>), Sabbath observance is a sure indicator of their loyalty to his covenant. <\/p> ",
