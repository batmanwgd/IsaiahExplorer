The idea that \"since the beginning, the Lord has existed\" is changed to \"when anything has been declared, the Lord has spoken it.\" In essence, the Book of Mormon version describes the Lord's role as being active rather than passive.<\/p> <p>The verse concludes with what appears to be Isaiah's own witness. He testifies through the Spirit that the Lord God (\"my lord, Jehovah\") sent him. Thus, verse 16 contains the testimonies of both divine and mortal beings, for both the Lord and Isaiah bear witness to the people.<\/p>",
