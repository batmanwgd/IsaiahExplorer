Elder John Longden interpreted verse 8 as a description of an airplane (see CR, Apr. 1964, p. 116). Verse 9 specifies the area under discussion as the \"isles,\" which would be the land of America (see <a class=\"ref\">2 Ne. 10:20<\/a>). That ships will bring the Lord's sons and their wealth from Tarshish suggests a great distance. The building of the walls of Zion by the \"sons of strangers\" has reference to the contribution the Gentiles and their kings will make to the building up of Zion.<\/p>     ",
