Though he be a very mean and obscure person, as to his outward condition in the world, yet he shall attain to a greater pitch of glory than the greatest monarchs enjoy. <i>He shall divide the spoil with the strong <\/i>\u2014The same thing repeated in other words. The sense of both clauses is, I will give him great and happy success in his undertaking: he shall conquer all his enemies, and <i>lead captivity captive;<\/i>, and he shall set up and establish his kingdom among and over all the kingdoms of the world: see <a class=\"ref\">Ephesians 1:20<\/a>, &c.; and <a class=\"ref\">Philippians 2:8-9<\/a>. <i>Because he hath poured out his soul unto death <\/i>\u2014Because he willingly laid down his life in obedience to God\u2019s command, and in order to the redemption of mankind. <i>And he was numbered with the transgressors <\/i>\u2014He was willing, for God\u2019s glory, and for man\u2019s salvation, to be reproached and punished, like a malefactor, in the same manner and place with them, and between two of them, <a class=\"ref\">Mark 15:27-28<\/a>. <i>And made intercession for the transgressors <\/i>\u2014He prayed upon earth for all sinners, and particularly for those that crucified him, and in heaven he still intercedes for them, by a legal demand of those good things which he purchased by the sacrifice of himself, which, though past, he continually represents to his Father as if it were present. <\/p>",
