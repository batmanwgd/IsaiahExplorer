The word is <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d9\u05d5\u05d3\u05e2 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">yodea<\/span>, knowing, supplied from the Syriac. The Chaldee had the same word in the copy before him, which he paraphrases by <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d2\u05dc\u05df \u05e7\u05d3\u05de\u05d9 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">kedemi gelon<\/span>, their deeds are manifest before me; and the Aldine and Complutensian editions of the Septuagint acknowledge the same word <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u03b5\u03c0\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9<\/span>, which is verified by MS. Pachom. and the Arabic version. I think there can be little doubt of its being genuine. The concluding verses of this chapter refer to the complete restoration of the Jews, and to the destruction of all the enemies of the Gospel of Christ, so that the earth shall be filled with the knowledge and glory of the Lord. <i>Talia saecla currite<\/i>! Lord, hasten the time!<\/p>\n\n<p><em>It shall come \"And I come\"\u2014<\/em>For <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d1\u05d0\u05d4 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">baah<\/span>, which will not accord with any thing in the sentence, I read <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d1\u05d0 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">ba<\/span>, with a MS.; the participle answering to <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d9\u05d5\u05d3\u05e2 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">yodea<\/span>, with which agree the Septuagint, Syriac, and Vulgate. Perhaps it ought to be <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d5\u05d1\u05d0 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">veba<\/span>, when I shall come, Syr.; and so the Septuagint, according to Edit. Ald. and Complut., and Cod. Marchal.<\/p>",
