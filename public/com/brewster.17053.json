Nor need his face turn \"pale,\" as it had previously done, because of their actions.<\/p>     <p>Furthermore, the children of Jacob themselves need no longer hang their heads in shame and sorrow as outcasts of society. Elder Orson Pratt noted: \"The house of Jacob has been made ashamed, and his face has waxed pale, ever since he was driven away from Lebanon or Canaan, but the Lord has now brought forth out of the ground a book which shall, accompanied by His power, restore the tribes of Jacob from the four quarters of the globe, and establish them in the land of Palestine and Lebanon forever.\" (OPW, 278.)<\/p>",
