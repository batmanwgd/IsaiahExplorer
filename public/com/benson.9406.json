    "html": "<p><a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 45:8<\/a>.<i>Drop down, ye heavens, from above, <\/i>&c. \u2014 It appears from the last clause of this verse, that these are the words of Jehovah himself, commanding blessings to descend upon his people, and exhorting his people willingly and gratefully to receive them, and to walk worthy of them. The passage is strongly figurative, and Vitringa is of opinion, that it \u201crefers primarily to the blessings consequent upon the deliverance from the Babylonish captivity; but secondarily, and in its more complete sense, to that righteousness and salvation liberally imparted to man by the grace of the Messiah.\u201d The words may be thus paraphrased: Let the heavens <i>drop down, <\/i>or, they shall <i>drop down, <\/i>as it were, from above, &c. God\u2019s righteous and gracious acts, done for his people, and his blessings conferred upon them, shall be as many and illustrious as if he rained them down from heaven. But <i>let the earth open <\/i>itself, both to receive those refreshing and fertilizing showers, and to bring forth those fruits which they might be reasonably expected to produce. <i>And let them <\/i>\u2014 The heavens and the earth conspiring together; <i>bring forth salvation <\/i>\u2014 The redemption and deliverance of God\u2019s people from Babylon, by Cyrus, and from ignorance and error, sin and death, by the Messiah. <i>And let righteousness spring up together <\/i>\u2014 Together with salvation. Let the holiness of my people bear some proportion to their privileges and advantages, and the great things I have done for them. <i>I the Lord have created it <\/i>\u2014 I am the author, both of the salvation and of the righteousness which springs up together with it.<\/p>",
