    "html": " <p> <em>For the Lord spake thus <\/em>&mdash;Spake that which immediately follows in the next verse. Warned him not to Unite in the alliance with foreign kingdoms which the nation was about forming. <\/p> <p> <em>With a strong hand <\/em>&mdash;Margin, &lsquo;With strength of hand.&rsquo; That is, when the hand of God urged me. A strong prophetic impulse is often represented as being produced by God&rsquo;s laying his hand on the prophet; or by his being thus, as it were, urged or impelled to it; <a class=\"ref\">Ezekiel 3:14<\/a>: &lsquo;The hand of Jehovah was strong upon me;&rsquo; <a class=\"ref\">2 Kings 3:15<\/a>: &lsquo;And it came to pass, that when the minstrel played, the hand of the Lord came upon him;&rsquo; <a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 20:7<\/a>: &lsquo;O Lord, thou art stronger than I, and hast prevailed;&rsquo; see also <a class=\"ref\">Ecclesiastes 2:24; 1 Kings 18:46; 2 Kings 3:15; Ezekiel 33:22; Ezekiel 40:1<\/a>; compare the Introduction, section 7. 11. (3.) The meaning is, that the prophet was strongly, and almost irresistibly, urged by the divine influence, to say what he was about to say. <\/p> <p> <em>That I should not walk... <\/em>&mdash;That I should not approve, and fall in with the design of Ahaz, and of the nation, in calling in the aid of the Assyrian armies. <\/p> ",
