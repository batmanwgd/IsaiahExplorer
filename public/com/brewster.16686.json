Drawing upon more modern translations of the Bible, Victor Ludlow identifies them as \"the 'beautiful craft' [that] were apparently the pleasure crafts or ships in which the wealthy traveled throughout the Mediterranean.\" (IPSP, 91.) J. R. Dummelow states: \"The word rendered 'pictures' means something figured or with imagery upon it.\" He goes on to explain that because of its relation to the mention of ships, it may have reference to \"the sails, which were often embroidered with figures in ancient times.\" (TOVBC, 415.) In any event, the Lord will take away these symbols of pride or power.<\/p>",
