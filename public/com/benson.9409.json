The sense is, Jerusalem shall not only be rebuilt, but the wealth and glory of other countries shall be brought to it again, as in former times. \u201cThe words,\u201d says Lowth, \u201cmay be supposed, in some degree, verified in Cyrus\u2019s devoting the tribute coming out of those rich provinces of Egypt, Ethiopia, and Seba, to the building and service of the temple.\u201d To which may be added, that some of the succeeding Persian monarchs settled revenues upon the temple for the offering of sacrifices for themselves and their families, <a class=\"ref\">Ezra 6:10<\/a>. And the same was done, in after times, by Alexander the Great, and several of the Syrian and Egyptian kings, <a class=\"ref\">2 Maccabees 3:2-3; 2 Maccabees 5:16<\/a>.\u201d But \u201cthe place is principally meant of the flourishing state of the church, (often described under the figure of a city,) when the Gentile world should come into it, bring in their riches to the support of it, and submit themselves to its government, as being the only seat and temple of truth.\u201d <i>In chains they shall come over <\/i>\u2014Subdued by the rod of the Messiah\u2019s strength, (<a class=\"ref\">Psalms 110:2<\/a>,) the power of his word, and led captive thereby: they shall confess themselves to be conquered, and shall willingly submit themselves to thee. The subjection of the Gentiles to God\u2019s church is often expressed in Scripture by such metaphors as this; as <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 45:5<\/a>; and <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 149:8<\/a>; and <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 68:18<\/a>, compared with <a class=\"ref\">Ephesians 4:8<\/a>. <i>They shall make supplication unto thee <\/i>\u2014To obtain thy favour and society; <i>saying, Surely God is in thee <\/i>\u2014Or, <i>with thee.<\/i>, We plainly discern that God is on thy side, or in the midst of thee; and therefore we desire to join ourselves with thee; <i>and there is none else <\/i>\u2014We are now convinced that Jehovah, thy God, is the only true God, and that idols are vain and empty nothings. <\/p>",
