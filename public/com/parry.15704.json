Matt. 26:67ff; John 19:1ff)&hellip;.

The Oriental regarded the beard as a sign of freedom and respect, and to pluck out the hair of the beard (for <i>cheek<\/i> in effect would refer to a beard) is to show utter contempt\" (<a class=\"ref\">Neh. 13:25; 2 Sam. 10:5<\/a>.). <\/p> <p><i>hid not my face.<\/i> The servant did not try to hide or escape from persecution. As Nephi wrote regarding Christ: \"And the world, because of their iniquity, shall judge him to be a thing of naught; wherefore they scourge him, and he suffereth it; and they smite him, and he suffereth it. Yea, they spit upon him, and he suffereth it, because of his loving kindness and his long-suffering towards the children of men\" (<a class=\"ref\">1 Ne. 19:9<\/a>). <\/p> ",
