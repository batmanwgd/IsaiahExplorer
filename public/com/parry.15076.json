    "html": " <p><i>Tyre was a famous Phoenician city noted for her commercial enterprises, great wealth, and materialism. Tyre was so well-known that she was called a \"market place of nations\" (23:3), and her traders and merchants were so celebrated that they were equated with the princes and the \"honorable of the earth\" (23:8).<\/i><\/p> <p><i>The Lord spoke against Tyre (and her inhabitants), decrying her pride by calling her a harlot. He also warned her inhabitants to repent, lest she become a desolate city. Tyre's inhabitants did not listen to the prophet and were thus destroyed.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>Tyre may be like many of the large cities in our world today, whose inhabitants' primary interest is obtaining material wealth. Such cities\u2014if their inhabitants are proud, if they glory in wickedness, and if they sell themselves to the ways of the world\u2014 will be destroyed when the Lord returns to the earth with great glory, just as Tyre was destroyed so long ago. Tyre, then, serves as a warning to us of the pitfalls of pride and materialism and the resultant destruction.<\/i><\/p> ",
