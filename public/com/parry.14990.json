God is considering events pertaining to the earth's inhabitants, and at the right moment he will carry out his designs.<\/p> <p> <i>like a clear heat upon herbs, and like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest.<\/i> Victor Ludlow writes: \"Verse 4 explains that, as the gospel goes forth, the Lord will calmly remain in his dwelling place like a 'clear heat' or a 'dewy mist' during the harvest season&hellip;. Like the delicate balance of warmth and moisture needed to fully ripen the grapes, God attends to the harvest of souls by providing the proper light (truth) and water (cleansing powers) to ensure the full development of each person.\" <\/p> ",
