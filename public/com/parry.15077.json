    "html": " <p> <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isa. 23<\/a> is the last of nine prophetic warnings against the heathen nations surrounding Israel. Isaiah began this series of pronouncements in chapter 13 with a prophecy against Babylon; he concludes it in this chapter with a prophecy against Tyre. These two cities symbolize worldliness\u2014Tyre was the center of commerce and a leading sea power; Babylon was the center of politics and a leading land power. Both were condemned for pride (13:11; 23:9) and referred to as harlots (23:15-17; <a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 86:3<\/a>). The prophecy against Babylon attacks worldliness; the prophecy against Tyre strikes at materialism. Both are types of the world in our day.<\/p> <p> Isaiah prophesies that the merchants of Tyre will learn of the destruction of their homeland and mourn (23:1). He uses colorful descriptions of Tyre's glory\u2014it is like a \"market place of nations\" (23:3), a \"joyous city\" (23:7), a \"crowning city,\" full of \"princes\" and the \"honorable of the earth\" (23:8). As a contrast, Isaiah describes the destruction of Tyre\u2014a defiled woman (23:9), who is weak (23:10), shamed (without children; 23:4), and a ruin (23:13). The Lord is responsible for planning Tyre's devastation (23:9), using Assyria's armies to accomplish his plan (23:13). The destruction of Tyre is a type of the destruction of the wicked\u2014and their wealth\u2014at the time of the Lord's return.<\/p> <blockquote> The burden of Tyre.     <br>Howl, ye ships of Tarshish; for it is laid waste,     <br>so that there is no house, no [harbor]:     <br>from the land of Chittim it is revealed to them. (23:1)     <br>Be still, ye inhabitants of the isle;     <br>thou whom the merchants of Zidon, that pass over the sea, have replenished. (23:2)     <br>And by <i>great waters<\/i> the <u>seed<\/u> of Sihor,     <br><u>the harvest<\/u> of the <i>river,<\/i> is her revenue;     <br>and she is a [market place] of nations. (23:3)     <br>Be thou ashamed, O Zidon:     <br>for <i>the sea<\/i> <u>hath spoken<\/u>,     <br>even <i>the strength of the sea,<\/i> <u>saying<\/u>,     <br>I <i>travail<\/i> not,     <br>nor <i>bring forth children,<\/i>     <br>neither do I <i>nourish up<\/i><u> young men<\/u>,     <br>nor <i>bring up<\/i> <u>virgins<\/u>. (23:4)     <br>[When] the <i>report [comes to] Egypt,<\/i>     <br>[they will be] sorely pained at the <i>report [from] Tyre.<\/i> (23:5)     <br>Pass ye over to Tarshish; howl, ye inhabitants of the isle. (23:6)     <br>Is this your joyous city, whose antiquity is of ancient days?     <br>her own feet shall carry her afar off to sojourn. (23:7)     <br>Who hath taken this counsel against Tyre, the crowning city,     <br><i>whose merchants<\/i> are <u>princes<\/u>,     <br><i>whose [traders] are the <u>honorable of the earth?<\/u> (23:8)<\/i>     <br><i>The Lord of hosts hath purposed it, to [defile] the pride<\/i> of <u>all glory<\/u>,     <br>and to <i>bring into contempt<\/i> <u>all the honorable of the earth<\/u>. (23:9)     <br>[Cultivate] thy land as [along the Nile], O daughter of Tarshish:     <br>there is no more strength [in thee]. <b> <\/b>(23:10)     <br>He <i>stretched out his hand<\/i> <u>over the sea<\/u>,     <br>he shook the kingdoms:     <br>the Lord hath <i>given a commandment <\/i><u>against [Phoenicia<\/u>],     <br>to destroy the strong holds thereof. (23:11)     <br>And he said, Thou shalt <i>no more rejoice,<\/i> O thou <u>oppressed virgin<\/u>,     <br><u>daughter of Zidon<\/u>: arise, pass over to Chittim;     <br>there also shalt thou <i>have no rest.<\/i> (23:12)     <br>Behold the land of the Chaldeans; this people [did not exist],     <br>till the Assyrian founded it for them that dwell in the wilderness:     <br>they <i>set up<\/i> the <u>towers<\/u> thereof,     <br>they <i>raised up<\/i> the <u>palaces<\/u> thereof,     <br>he brought it to a <u>ruin<\/u>. (23:13)     <br>Howl, ye ships of Tarshish: for your [fortress] is laid waste. (23:14)<\/blockquote> ",
