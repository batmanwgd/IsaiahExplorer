    "html": " <i>tongue of the Egyptian sea.<\/i> The word <i>tongue<\/i> should be translated \"gulf.\" This phrase recalls the occasion when Moses and the Israelites crossed the Red Sea on dry ground (<a class=\"ref\">Ex. 14:21-22<\/a>), an event that anticipates the gathering in the last days, when no powerful nation, mortal tyrant, or army will stop the promised events of the gathering of the saints around God's standard.<\/p> <p><i>with his mighty wind shall he shake his hand over the river&hellip;and make men go over dryshod.<\/i> Three elements in this passage, <i>mighty wind, hand,<\/i> and <i>go over dryshod,<\/i> recall the Israelites' crossing of the Red Sea. \"Moses stretched out his <i>hand<\/i> over the sea; and the Lord caused the sea to go back by a <i>strong east wind<\/i> all that night, and made the sea dry land&hellip;And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the <i>dry ground<\/i>\" (<a class=\"ref\">Ex. 14:21-22<\/a>; emphasis added). The same powers that guided the ancient Israelites out of Egypt will guide modern Israel out of symbolic Egypt (the world) to their gathering places.<\/p> <p><i>seven<\/i> <i>streams.<\/i> The Living Bible translation provides a possible interpretation: \"The Lord will&hellip;wave his hand over the Euphrates, sending a mighty wind to divide it into seven streams that can easily be crossed.\"<\/p> ",
