If rejection and implacable judgment by God lie in the future for the descendants of Jacob, those are not God\u2019s final word. For further out in the future, beyond those realities, lie still greater realities: divine \u201ccompassion\u201d and a reaffirmation of God\u2019s choosing of them to be his own people. If it is true that the land will one day spit them out (cf. Lev. 18:28), it is also true that beyond that day is another day when God will once more \u201csettle them in their own land.\u201d Once more the prophet affirms that the coming destruction is not because the Mesopotamian powers are so great that God cannot stop them. No, those powers are mere tools in his hand, and once their work is finished, they too will come in for judgment while Israel will be restored to all the promises.<\/p>     <p>\u2003Not only will Israel be freed from the onerous grip of the nations, but either the nations must become partners with Israel (as in 2:2\u20135) or they will have to submit to the rule of Israel (14:1b\u20132)! If the oppression of the tyrants seems endless, Israel must remember that such rule is strictly limited and that someday the tables will be radically turned. How exciting it must have been for the Judean exiles as they recognized the arrival of Cyrus whom Isaiah had predicted and so knew that the hour for the overthrow of the Babylonian tyrant had arrived, the hour when they could sing Isaiah\u2019s song not as a prediction but as a fact. The faithful among them had sung it secretly in daring hope, but now it could be sung openly, as 14:3\u20134a promised.<\/p>     ",
