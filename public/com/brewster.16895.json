Judgment will come upon those who are guilty of such offenses. A penetrating question is then asked: In your own day of need, \"to whom will ye flee (turn) for help?\" Unless these neglectful and oppressive people repent, they cannot expect the help of the Lord in their hour of need.<\/p>     <table>         <tbody>             <tr>                 <td><b><a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODYxXQ==\">Isaiah 10<\/a><br><br><br>1 <i>Woe<\/i> unto them that decree unrighteous decrees, and that write grievousness which they have prescribed;<br><br>2 To turn <u>aside<\/u> the needy from judgment, and to take away the right from the poor of my people, that widows may be their prey, and that they may rob the fatherless! <br><br><\/b>3 And what will ye do in the day of visitation, and in the desolation which shall come from far? to whom will ye flee for help? and where will ye leave your glory?                     <br>                     <br>4 Without me they shall bow down under the prisoners, and they shall fall under the slain.
