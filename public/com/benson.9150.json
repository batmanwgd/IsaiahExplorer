The sense is, Thou shalt use much industry and cost, but to no purpose, as it follows. <i>In the day shalt thou make thy plant to grow, <\/i> &c.\u2014Beginning early in the morning, thou shalt, from day to day, use all care and diligence, that what thou hast planted and sown may thrive; <i>but the harvest shall be a heap, <\/i> &c.\u2014But in the time of your grief, or when this grievous calamity shall come, all your harvest shall be but one heap, very inconsiderable in itself, and easily carried away by your enemies: in other words, \u201cwhen thou expectest to reap the fruit of thy labours, thou shalt find nothing but loss and disappointment.\u201d\u2014Lowth. See the margin, where <i>the day of inheritance <\/i> means the time of enjoying any thing which we have taken pains for. <\/p> ",
