He along with his successor Shabako (715\u2013 702) brought a new energy to Egyptian affairs. Most likely both of them attempted to cement alliances with various surrounding countries in order to counter the Assyrian threat posed by both Sargon and Sennacherib. We can imagine the stir made in Jerusalem by the tall, regal-looking Ethiopian envoys, who came up the Mediterranean coast in their strange \u201cpapyrus\u201d craft (18:2). But Isaiah says that envoys should instead go to Ethiopia to tell them to beware of the true Ruler of the world. It is his battle flag and his war trumpet for which they should be on the alert (18:3).<\/p>     ",
