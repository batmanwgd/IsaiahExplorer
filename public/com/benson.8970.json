It is a metonymical expression, by which sins are said <i>to be purged, <\/i>,as <a class=\"ref\">Hebrews 1:3 <\/a>,, when men are <i>purged from their sins, <\/i>, <a class=\"ref\">Hebrews 9:14 <\/a>. <i>If ye be willing and obedient <\/i>\u2014If you be heartily willing and fully resolved to obey all my commands; <i>ye shall eat the good of the land \u2014 <\/i>,Together with the pardon of your sins, you shall receive temporal and worldly blessings. <i>But if ye refuse and rebel <\/i>\u2014If you obstinately persist in your disobedience to me, as hitherto you have done; <i>ye shall be devoured with the sword <\/i>\u2014With the sword of your enemies, which shall be commissioned to destroy you, and with the sword of God\u2019s justice, his wrath and vengeance, which shall be drawn against you; <i>for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it <\/i>\u2014And he will surely make it good for the maintaining of his own honour. <\/p>,",
