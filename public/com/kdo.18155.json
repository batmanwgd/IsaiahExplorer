    "html": "<p> In <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzE3XQ==\">Isaiah 53:5<\/a>, \u05d5\u05d4\u05d5\u05bc\u05d0 , as contrasted with \u05d5\u05d0\u05e0\u05d7\u05e0\u05d5\u05bc , continues the true state of the case as contrasted with their false judgment. <em> \u201cWhereas He was pierced for our sins, bruised for our iniquities: the punishment was laid upon Him for our peace; and through His stripes we were healed.\u201d<\/em> The question is, whether  describes what He was during His life, or what He was in His death. The words decide in favour of the latter. For although <em> c ha\u0302la\u0302l <\/em> is applied to a person mortally wounded but not yet dead (<a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 51:52; Psalms 69:27<\/a>), and <em> c ha\u0302lal <\/em> to a heart wounded to death (<a class=\"ref\">Psalms 109:22<\/a>); the pure passives used here, which denote a calamity inflicted by violence from without, more especially <em> m e cho\u0304la\u0302l <\/em> , which is not the participle <em> polal<\/em> of <em> c h\u0131\u0304l <\/em> (made to twist one's self with pain), but the participle <em> poal<\/em> of <em> c ha\u0302l <\/em> (pierced, <em> transfossus <\/em> , the passive of <em> m e cho\u0304le\u0304l <\/em> , <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NjgzXQ==\">Isaiah 51:9<\/a>), and the substantive clauses, which express a fact that has become complete in all its circumstances, can hardly be understood in any other way than as denoting, that \u201cthe servant of God\u201d floated before the mind of the speaker in all the sufferings of death, just as was the case with Zechariah in <a class=\"ref\">Zechariah 12:10<\/a>. There were no stronger expressions to be found in the language, to denote a violent and painful death. As <em> min<\/em> , with the passive, does not answer to the Greek \u03c5\u0314\u03c0\u03bf\u0301 , but to \u03b1\u0313\u03c0\u03bf\u0301 , the meaning is not that it was our sins and iniquities that had pierced Him through like swords, and crushed Him like heavy burdens, but that He was pierced and crushed on account of our sins and iniquities. It was not His own sins and iniquities, but <em> ours<\/em> , which He had taken upon Himself, that He might make atonement for them in our stead, that were the cause of His having to suffer so cruel and painful a death. <\/p><p> The ultimate cause is not mentioned; but \u05e2\u05dc\u05d9\u05d5 \u05e9\u05c1\u05dc\u05d5\u05de\u05e0\u05d5\u05bc \u05de\u05d5\u05bc\u05e1\u05e8 which follows points to it. His suffering was a <em> m u\u0304sa\u0302r <\/em> , which is an indirect affirmation that it was God who had inflicted it upon Him, for who else could the <em> yo\u0304se\u0304r <\/em> (<em> m e yasse\u0304r <\/em> ) be? We have rendered <em> m u\u0304sa\u0302r <\/em> \u201cpunishment;\u201d and there was no other word in the language for this idea; for though \u05e0\u05e7\u05dd and \u05e4\u05bc\u05e7\u05d3\u05bc\u05d4 (to which Hofmann refers) have indeed the idea of punishment associated with them, the former signifies \u03b5\u0313\u03ba\u03b4\u03b9\u0301\u03ba\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 , the latter \u03b5\u0313\u03c0\u03b9\u0301\u03c3\u03ba\u03b5\u03c8\u03b9\u03c2 , whereas <em> m u\u0304sa\u0302r <\/em> not only denotes \u03c0\u03b1\u03b9\u03b4\u03b5\u03b9\u0301\u03b1 , as the chastisement of love (<a class=\"ref\">Proverbs 3:11<\/a>), but also as the infliction of punishment (= \u03c4\u03b9\u03bc\u03c9\u03c1\u03b9\u0301\u03b1 \u03ba\u03bf\u0301\u03bb\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 , <a class=\"ref\">Proverbs 7:22; Jeremiah 30:14<\/a>), just as David, when he prayed that God might not punish him in His anger and hot displeasure (<a class=\"ref\">Psalms 6:2<\/a>), could not find a more suitable expression for punishment, regarded as the execution of judgment, than \u05d9\u05e1\u05bc\u05e8 ( \u05d4\u05d5\u05db\u05d9\u05d7 ). The word itself, which follows the form of <em> m u\u0304sa\u0302d <\/em> (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTgxXQ==\">Isaiah 28:16<\/a>), signifies primarily being chastised (from <em> ya\u0302sar <\/em> = <em> va\u0302sar <\/em> , <em> constringere <\/em> , <em> coercere <\/em> ), and included from the very outset the idea of practical chastisement, which then passed over into that of admonition in words, of warning by example, and of chastity as a moral quality. In the case before us, in which the reference is to a sufferer, and to a <em> m u\u0304sa\u0302r <\/em> resting upon him, this can only mean actual chastisement. If the expression had been \u05e2\u05dc\u05d9\u05d5 \u05de\u05d5\u05bc\u05e1\u05e8\u05e0\u05d5\u05bc , it would merely mean that God had caused Him, who had taken upon Himself our sins and iniquities and thus made Himself representatively or vicariously guilty, to endure the chastisement which those sins deserved. but it is \u05e9\u05c1\u05dc\u05d5\u05de\u05e0\u05d5\u05bc \u05de\u05d5\u05bc\u05e1\u05e8 . The connection of the words is the same as that of \u05d7\u05d9\u05bc\u05d9\u05dd \u05ea\u05bc\u05d5\u05db\u05d7\u05ea in <a class=\"ref\">Proverbs 15:31<\/a>. As the latter signifies \u201creproof leading to life,\u201d so the former signifies \u201cthe chastisement which leads to our peace.\u201d It is true that the suffix belongs to the one idea, that that has grown up through this combination of the words, like <em> b e r\u0131\u0304th <\/em> <em> sh e lo\u0304m\u0131\u0304 <\/em> , \u201cmy peace-covenant\u201d (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzM0XQ==\">Isaiah 54:10<\/a>); but what else could our \u201cpeace-chastisement\u201d be, than the chastisement that brings us peace, or puts us into a state of salvation? This is the idea involved in Stier's rendering, \u201crestoring chastisement,\u201d and Hofmann's, \u201cthe chastisement wholesome for us.\u201d The difference in the exposition simply lies in the view entertained of the <em> m u\u0304sa\u0302r <\/em> , in which neither of these commentators will allow that there is any idea of a visitation of justice here. But according to our interpretation, the genitive \u05e9\u05c1\u05dc\u05d5\u05de\u05e0\u05d5 , which defines the <em> m u\u0304sa\u0302r <\/em> so far as its object and results are concerned, clearly shows that this manifestation of the justice of God, this satisfaction procured by His holiness, had His love for its foundation and end. It was our peace, or, what is more in accordance with the full idea of the word, our general well-being, our blessedness, which these sufferings arrived at and secured (the synonyms of <em> sha\u0302lo\u0304m <\/em> are <em> to\u0304bh <\/em> and <em> y e shu\u0304\u201ba\u0302h <\/em> , <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzA0XQ==\">Isaiah 52:7<\/a>). In what follows, \u201cand by His stripes (<em> c ha\u0306bhu\u0304ra\u0302h <\/em> = <em> c habbu\u0304ra\u0302h <\/em> , <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NjYxXQ==\">Isaiah 1:6<\/a>) we have been healed,\u201d <em> sha\u0302lo\u0304m <\/em> is defined as a condition of salvation brought about by healing. \u201c<em> Venustissimum <\/em> \u03bf\u0313\u03be\u03c5\u0301\u03bc\u03c9\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd ,\u201d exclaims Vitringa here. He means the same as Jerome when he says, <em> suo vulnere vulnera nostra curavit <\/em> . The stripes and weals that were inflicted upon Him have made us sound and well (the lxx keeps the collective singular, and renders it very aptly \u03c4\u03c9\u0345\u0342 \u03bc\u03c9\u0301\u03bb\u03c9\u03c0\u03b9 \u03b1\u03c5\u0313\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u0342 ; cf., <a class=\"ref\">1 Peter 2:24<\/a>). We were sick unto death because of our sins; but He, the sinless one, took upon Himself a suffering unto death, which was, as it were, the concentration and essence of the woes that we had deserved; and this voluntary endurance, this submission to the justice of the Holy One, in accordance with the counsels of divine love, became the source of our healing.<\/p>",
