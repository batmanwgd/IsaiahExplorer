The Septuagint and Chaldee both express the night, which is almost necessary to answer to day in the preceding line, as well as to perfect the sense here. I therefore think that we ought, upon the authority of the Septuagint and Chaldee, to read either <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d5\u05dc\u05d9\u05dc\u05d4 <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, velailah<\/span>, and by night, instead of <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d5\u05dc\u05e0\u05d2\u05d4 <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, ulenogah<\/span>, and for brightness; or <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d1\u05dc\u05d9\u05dc\u05d4 \u05d5\u05dc\u05e0\u05d2\u05d4 <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, ulenogah ballailah<\/span>, adding the word <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d1\u05dc\u05d9\u05dc\u05d4 <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, ballailah<\/span>, by night. - L. <\/p>",
