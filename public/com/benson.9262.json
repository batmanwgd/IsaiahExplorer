The<i> drag<\/i> consisted of a sort of frame of strong planks, made rough at the bottom, with hard stones or iron: it was drawn by horses or oxen over the corn-sheaves spread on the floor, the driver sitting upon it. The<i> wain<\/i> was much like the former, but had wheels with iron teeth, or edges, like a saw. This not only forced out the grain, but cut the straw in pieces for fodder for the cattle; for in the eastern countries they have no hay. The last method is well known from the law of Moses, which forbids the ox to be muzzled when he treadeth out the corn,<a class=\"ref\">Deuteronomy 25:4<\/a> .\u201d \u2014 Bishop Lowth.<i> This also cometh from the Lord of hosts,<\/i> &c. \u2014 This part of the husbandman\u2019s discretion expressed in these verses, as well as that expressed in<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODE4OSI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 28:24-25<\/a> . These words contain the application of the similitude. The husbandman manages his affairs with common discretion; but God governs the world and his church with wonderful wisdom: he is great and marvellous, both in the contrivance of things, and in the execution of them.<\/p> ",
