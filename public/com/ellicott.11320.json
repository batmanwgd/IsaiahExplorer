The bold imagery has its starting-point in what the prophet had heard of the great cities of the Tigris and Euphrates. What those rivers were to Nineveh and Babylon, that the presence of Jehovah would be to Jerusalem, that could boast only of the softly going waters of Shiloah (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODE0XQ==\">Isaiah 8:6<\/a>). Here, again, we have an echo of Psalms 46 : \u201cThere is a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God.\u201d The words help us to understand the symbolism of Ezekiel\u2019s vision of the \u201criver that could not be passed over,\u201d flowing out of the Temple (<a class=\"ref\">Ezekiel 47:1-5<\/a>). And the spiritual river of the Divine Presence would have this advantage over those of which the great cities boasted, that no hostile fleet, no pirate ships, could use it for their attacks. So in<a class=\"ref\">Psalms 48:7<\/a> the \u201cships of Tarshish\u201d are probably to be taken \u2018figuratively rather than literally\u2019 for the Assyrian forces.<\/p> ",
