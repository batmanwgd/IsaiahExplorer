    "html": "<p>A condition of wickedness among Jehovah&rsquo;s people marked by cultic practices (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3sic2luZ2xlcyI6WzE4MjM1XX0seyIxODIyMSI6Mn0seyIxODkwMCI6Nn1d\">vv 3-4, 17; Isaiah 65:2-7<\/a>) and persecution by ecclesiastical authorities (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MjIzLDE4ODUxXQ==\">v 5; Isaiah 61:7<\/a>) that utterly contravenes Jehovah&rsquo;s law and word in the end gives rise to a Zion people. Out of an evil milieu, paradoxically exemplified by Jehovah&rsquo;s people who are of the covenant, emerges a new covenant people among whom Jehovah establishes Zion (cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3sic2luZ2xlcyI6WzE4NzI1XX0seyIxODcyOSI6Mn1d\">Isaiah 54:1, 5-6<\/a>). Not only does &ldquo;the restoration of all things&rdquo; that existed in ancient Israel materialize from these spiritual ashes but a state of blessedness far exceeding the former.<\/p><p>Called the &ldquo;Birthpangs of the Messiah,&rdquo; the idea of a woman in labor who gives birth to a deliverer recurs cyclically in Israel&rsquo;s history&mdash;as when Israel&rsquo;s tribes endured hard bondage in Egypt and Jehovah heard their cries and raised up Moses to deliver them (<a class=\"ref\">Exodus 1-3<\/a>); or when the Philistines were about to wipe Israel off the map and Jehovah raised up King David to deliver them (<a class=\"ref\">2 Samuel 3:18<\/a>); or when Jehovah&rsquo;s people in Jerusalem were surrounded by an invading Assyrian army and King Hezekiah interceded with Jehovah on their behalf (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODM2OCI6Nn0=\">Isaiah 37:15-20<\/a>). So he raises up an end-time deliverer.<\/p><p>Before the Woman Zion goes into labor, however&mdash;that is, before Jehovah&rsquo;s Day of Judgment but when many mourn in Zion because wickedness (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MzU4LDE4ODQ3LDE4ODUxXQ==\">v 5; Isaiah 61:3, 7<\/a>)&mdash;she gives birth to a &ldquo;son&rdquo; or &ldquo;male child&rdquo; (<em>zakar<\/em>). The Woman&rsquo;s son or deliverer&mdash;Jehovah&rsquo;s servant&mdash;thus experiences rebirth or ascent to a higher spiritual level (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3sic2luZ2xlcyI6WzE4NjM5LDE4NjQ1XX0seyIxODc0NSI6Mn1d\">Isaiah 49:2, 8; 55:4-5<\/a>) when Jehovah heals and empowers him (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3sic2luZ2xlcyI6WzE4NzEwXX0seyIxODc4NCI6Mn1d\">Isaiah 52:13; 57:18-19<\/a>). That empowerment constitutes an inherent part of his ascent phase that follows his descent phase through suffering in which he is &ldquo;marred beyond human likeness&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTg3MTE=\">Isaiah 52:14<\/a>).<\/p><p>Jehovah prospers his servant&rsquo;s ministry (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3sic2luZ2xlcyI6WzE4NzIyXX0seyIxODYyOSI6Mn1d\">Isaiah 48:14-15; 53:10<\/a>), and it bears good fruit (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzM2LDE3ODg2XQ==\">Isaiah 4:2; 11:1<\/a>), when the servant empowers additional servants to labor with him in restoring Jehovah&rsquo;s people and preparing them for Jehovah&rsquo;s coming (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg3MDQiOjR9LHsiMTg4NDciOjh9XQ==\">Isaiah 52:7-10; 61:3-10<\/a>). The nation that is born in a &ldquo;day&rdquo;&mdash;Jehovah&rsquo;s Day of Judgment&mdash;thus comprises those of his people who are reborn at the time they are restored and ascend to higher spiritual categories (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3sic2luZ2xlcyI6WzE3NzM3XX0seyIxODY5OCI6Mn1d\">Isaiah 4:3; 52:1-2<\/a>). With them, Jehovah covenants to be &ldquo;your God&rdquo; and they his people by an everlasting covenant (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg3MjkiOjZ9LHsiMTg3NDQiOjN9XQ==\">Isaiah 54:5-10; 55:3-5<\/a>).<\/p><p><em>As soon as she was in labor, Zion gave birth to her children.<\/em> The &ldquo;children&rdquo; or &ldquo;sons&rdquo; (<em>baneha<\/em>) to whom the Woman Zion gives birth comprise particularly that category of Jehovah&rsquo;s people that is reborn or which ascends to the son\/servant level. They return in the new exodus to Zion from among all nations: &ldquo;Bring my sons from afar and my daughters from the end of the earth&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTg1MTI=\">Isaiah 43:6<\/a>); &ldquo;Lift up your eyes and look about you! They have all assembled to come to you: your sons shall arrive from afar; your daughters shall return to your side&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTg4MjY=\">Isaiah 60:4<\/a>; cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3sic2luZ2xlcyI6WzE4NjU5LDE4ODI1XX0seyIxNzg5NSI6M30seyIxODY1NCI6Mn1d\">11:10-12; 49:17-18, 22; 60:3<\/a>).<\/p><p><em>Who has heard the like, or who has seen such things?<\/em> Beginning with the mission of the servant, the restoration of Jehovah&rsquo;s people causes quite a stir among the nations (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzA3LDE4NzEyLDE4ODU2XQ==\">Isaiah 52:10, 15; 62:1<\/a>). Many oppose the work of restoring his people, repudiating the fact that it is of God: &ldquo;Woe to those in conflict with their Maker, mere shards of earthenware pottery! As though the clay were to say to him who molds it, &lsquo;What are you doing? Your hands have no skill for the work!&rsquo; Woe to those who say to their Father, &lsquo;What have you begotten?&rsquo; or to the Woman, &lsquo;What have you borne?&rsquo;&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODU3MSI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 45:9-10<\/a>).<\/p><p><em>Can the earth labor but a day?<\/em> As at Israel&rsquo;s birth as a nation when it came out of Egypt (<a class=\"ref\">Exodus 6:7<\/a>), true deliverance entails victory over enemies (<a class=\"ref\">Exodus 14:27-28<\/a>). When the entire earth goes into labor in Jehovah&rsquo;s Day of Judgment, Babylon&rsquo;s children die: &ldquo;Bereavement and widowhood shall suddenly overtake you, both in one day&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTg2MDk=\">Isaiah 47:9<\/a>); &ldquo;They shall be terrified, in throes of agony, seized with trembling like a woman in labor&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTc5MTU=\">Isaiah 13:8<\/a>); &ldquo;&lsquo;I will rise up against them,&rsquo; says Jehovah of Hosts. &lsquo;I will cut off Babylon&rsquo;s name and remnant, its offspring and descendants&rsquo;&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTc5NTE=\">Isaiah 14:22<\/a>).<\/p>",
