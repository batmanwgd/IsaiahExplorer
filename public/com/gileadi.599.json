    "html": "<p>Jehovah dispenses their own toxic brew to his people&rsquo;s enemies as he reverses the circumstances of those who repent: &ldquo;I will feed your oppressors with their own flesh; they shall be drunk with their own blood as with wine&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg2NjMiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 49:26<\/a>); &ldquo;Poor wretch, tempest-tossed and disconsolate!... You shall be firmly established through righteousness; you will be far from oppression and have no cause to fear, far from ruin, for it shall not approach you&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg3MzUiOjJ9XQ==\">Isaiah 54:11, 14<\/a>); &ldquo;I will delight in Jerusalem, rejoice in my people; no more shall be heard there the sound of weeping or the cry of distress&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg5MTciOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 65:19<\/a>).<\/p><p>In the same way that the servant&mdash;Jehovah&rsquo;s right <em>hand<\/em>&mdash;initially suffers at the hands of wicked men (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg2NjkiOjF9LHsiMTg3MTEiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 50:6; 52:14<\/a>), so do those who follow and know him (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg2NjQiOjJ9LHsiMTg4NTEiOjF9XQ==\">vv 1, 7; Isaiah 61:7<\/a>). But Jehovah turns the tables on his people&rsquo;s tormentors when he doses the archtyrant&mdash;Jehovah&rsquo;s (left) <em>hand<\/em>&mdash;with his own medicine. At all times, Jehovah is true to the terms of his covenant. When his people&rsquo;s enemies violate the rights of those who keep the terms of the covenant, they incur the curses of the covenant: &ldquo;I had resolved on a day of vengeance, and the year of my redeemed had come&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg4NzEiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 63:4<\/a>).<\/p>",
