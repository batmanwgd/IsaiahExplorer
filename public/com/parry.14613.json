    "html": " <p>Even though the Israelites exist in a spiritually sick condition (1:5b-9) and are found in a state of apostasy (1:10-15), God nevertheless invites them to return to him through repentance, so they can worship the true God of Israel. God then tells them what they must do to become clean and temple worthy once again. God's message requires Israel to become clean through ordinances (\"wash ye\") and Jesus' atonement (1:18). Emphasis is also placed on having a desire to be clean and on doing good works (\"if ye be willing and obedient\"), which will allow them to \"eat the good of the land\" (1:19). Nine imperatives\u2014<i>wash, make clean, put away, cease, learn, seek, relieve, vindicate,<\/i> and <i>plead<\/i>\u2014serve as guidelines that will help Israel return to righteous living. The same imperatives apply to us in this dispensation.<\/p> <blockquote><i>Wash<\/i> <u>[ye]<\/u>,     <br><i>make<\/i> <u>you<\/u><i> clean<\/i>;     <br><i>put away the evil of your doings <\/i>from before mine eyes;     <br><i>cease to do evil; <\/i>(1:16)     <br>Learn to do well;     <br>seek [justice],     <br><i>relieve<\/i> the <u>oppressed<\/u>,     <br><i>[vindicate] the <u>fatherless<\/u>,<\/i>     <br><i>plead<\/i> for the <u>widow<\/u>. (1:17)     <br>Come now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord:     <br>though your sins be as <i>scarlet,<\/i> they shall be as white as <u>snow<\/u>;     <br>though they be red like <i>crimson,<\/i> they shall be as <u>wool<\/u>. (1:18)     <br>If ye be <i>willing and obedient,<\/i> ye shall <u>eat the good<\/u> of the land; (1:19)     <br>But if ye <i>refuse and rebel,<\/i> ye shall be <u>devoured<\/u> with the sword.     <br>for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.
