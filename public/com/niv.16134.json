    "html": "               <p>A<small>SSYRIA IS THE<\/small> \u201crod\u201d that is held in God\u2019s upraised hand (9:12, 17, 21; 10:4), and it is raised up to punish \u201ca godless nation.\u201d As with the charge that Judah and Israel had become God\u2019s enemies (1:24\u201325; 10:3), so this word must have seemed unjust to many. Surely the Assyrians are the ones who are \u201cgodless\u201d and perverse. But the fact is, the Israelites have been given the covenant of God, and the Assyrians have not. The people of God know better, yet they pervert their way by turning their backs on the truth revealed to them. The Assyrians would certainly disdain the idea that they are no more than a tool in the hand of the God of the little, despicable nations of Israel and Judah. Their \u201cpurpose\u201d (10:7) is not to obey Yahweh but to conquer and \u201cdestroy\u201d as many nations as possible. In other words, they recognize no purpose in life but their own will to power.<\/p>     <p>\u2003This idea is expressed in the quotation put in the mouth of the Assyrian king in 10:8\u201311. The language is reminiscent of 37:10\u201313. The king has no qualms about saying that he is superior to everything on earth, including all its gods. He is so great that even his \u201ccommanders\u201d are the equivalent of the kings of other lands. He is truly the king of kings.<\/p>     <p>\u2003The first four cities mentioned in 10:9 were all fortress cities in northwestern Syria, outposts of \u201cDamascus.\u201d But fortresses or not, the tyrant says he has treated them all alike, destroying them. Nor have Damascus and Samaria escaped his grasp. Moreover, since far finer idols than those in Samaria and Jerusalem have not been able to save their lands from the Assyrian king, and since he has in fact already taken Samaria and its gods, why should he think of himself as the lackey of Jerusalem\u2019s God? He is superior to that God and will do to Jerusalem whatever he wants.<\/p>     <p>\u2003But as Isaiah points out, the king of Assyria is not superior to Jerusalem\u2019s God. Whatever he thinks, he is coming against Jerusalem with only one task: to carry out the \u201cwork\u201d God has for him to do \u201cagainst Mount Zion.\u201d When Jerusalem\u2019s punishment is complete, at least for the moment, Assyria\u2019s punishment will begin (10:12). That punishment will be because of Assyrian \u201cpride,\u201d which is expressed in another quotation from their king (10:13\u2013 14). The prominence of \u201chand\u201d seems significant in these two verses. That king does not recognize that he is a tool in the hand of God. Rather, he boasts that it is his \u201chand\u201d that has captured the nations and their wealth, his \u201chand\u201d that has looted the nations as though they were nests of \u201cabandoned eggs.\u201d No one even dared to flap \u201ca wing\u201d to protest his plundering.<\/p>     <p>\u2003But Assyria is not acting independently, despite their thinking. They are but tools in the hand of Yahweh. There are two figures used in 10:15. The first involves lumbering tools, the \u201cax\u201d and the \u201csaw,\u201d while the second set are tools of warfare or oppression, the \u201crod\u201d and the \u201cclub.\u201d God said he would cut down the \u201cforest\u201d of Judah\u2019s pride (6:13), and Assyria is the \u201cax\u201d in God\u2019s hand to accomplish that task. God also said that he would punish his people for their sin (5:25), and Assyria is the instrument of that punishment. But Assyria does not admit that it is not ultimate and thinks, foolishly, that it moves itself.<\/p>     <p>\u2003Because Assyria refuses to recognize the truth, God will turn the tool over to destruction. The \u201cflame\u201d (10:16) of God\u2019s holiness, which was once turned on Israel (6:11\u201312), will be turned on those who refuse to admit that there might be One superior to them. When Israel turns and recognizes who their true \u201cLight\u201d is, that light will blaze against their enemies and not against them. The metaphors of field and forest are used again to convey the idea of glory destroyed (10:17\u201319). Not only the least in Assyria (\u201cthorns\u201d and \u201cbriers\u201d) but also the greatest (\u201cforests and fertile fields\u201d) will be consumed\u2014and all \u201cin a single day.\u201d This most likely refers to the destruction of the Assyrian army in 701 <small>B.C.<\/small> (see 37:36\u201337). When 185,000 died in a single night (note \u201ca wasting disease\u201d in 10:16), Sennacherib had only a \u201cfew\u201d soldiers (\u201ctrees of his forests,\u201d 10:19) left to accompany him on a hasty departure to his homeland.<\/p>     ",
