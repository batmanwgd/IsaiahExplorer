Instead of warning of trouble as Jehovah&rsquo;s Day of Judgment approaches, they resemble wanton herdsmen who scatter the sheep and feed themselves off the fattest (<a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 23:1-2; 50:6-7; Ezekiel 34:1-8<\/a>). Instead of serving as proxy saviors to Jehovah&rsquo;s people under the terms of the Davidic Covenant (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4Mzg4LDE4ODg0LDE4OTA2XQ==\">Isaiah 37:35; 63:17; 65:8<\/a>), they look out for themselves.<\/p><p>Word links round out the shepherds&rsquo; recriminatory state: &ldquo;These too have indulged in wine and are giddy with strong drink: priests and prophets have gone astray through liquor. They are intoxicated with wine and stagger because of strong drink; they err as seers, they blunder in their decisions&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTgxNzI=\">Isaiah 28:7<\/a>); &ldquo;Procrastinate, and become bewildered; preoccupy yourselves, until you cry for help. Be drunk, but not with wine; stagger, but not from strong drink. Jehovah has poured out on you a spirit of deep sleep: he has shut your eyes, the prophets; he has covered your heads, the seers&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODIwMyI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 29:9-10<\/a>).<\/p>",
