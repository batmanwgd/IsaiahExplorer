    "html": "<p>In Egypt&rsquo;s political capital, Pharaoh and his advisers follow foolish policies in their attempts at economic recovery, further exacerbating Egypt&rsquo;s problems. Considering themselves as wise as Egypt&rsquo;s founding fathers, they act presumptuously, only to lead Egypt deeper into ruin. Deviating from well-proven principles&mdash;relying instead on their own wisdom&mdash;they and their remedial strategies cause a loss of confidence in the nation, leading to anarchy and civil war (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODAwNyI6Mn0=\">vv 2-3<\/a>). If Pharaoh and his advisers are indeed as wise as they regard themselves, then let them predict what Jehovah has in store for Egypt!<\/p>",
