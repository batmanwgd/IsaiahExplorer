The redeemed return.<\/b> Notice the words, <i>singing, joy, holiness, gladness.<\/i> These describe a great event that is happening as missionaries gather covenant Israel (see D&amp;C 101:18\u201319). Also see footnotes 11<i>a<\/i> and 11<i>b<\/i>. They refer to Topical Guide headings \"Israel, Restoration of\" and \"Israel, Gathering of.\" How are these things different? The restoration of Israel refers more to their coming to Jesus Christ and recognizing him as the Messiah. Many Jews recognize Jesus as a great teacher or rabbi, but not as the promised Messiah. When they begin to recognize him as the Messiah, that will be the restoration of Israel. For example, Jacob, our guide, says that Isaiah has spoken to the Jews \"until the time comes that they shall be restored to the true church and fold of God\" (2 Nephi 9:2). The \"gathering of Israel\" may refer to physical gathering only, returning to their lands, but not necessarily to the spiritual gathering, or restoration to the true Church.  <\/p>  ",
