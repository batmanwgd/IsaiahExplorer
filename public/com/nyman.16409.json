    "html": "          <p>This verse is closely akin to a sign given by the Savior on the Mount of Olives which was to precede his second coming (see <a class=\"ref\">Matt. 24:29<\/a>). There are also several references in the Doctrine and Covenants which are very similar to this verse, referring to the period of the Second Coming (see <a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 29:14; 34:9; 45:42; 88:87; 133:49<\/a>). Oliver Cowdery apparently was quoting or paraphrasing this verse, along with <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3OTIwXQ==\">Isaiah 13:13<\/a>, when he reported what scriptures the angel Moroni quoted to Joseph Smith in September 1823 and noted that they were soon to be fulfilled (see MA, Apr. 1835, pp. 111-12). There is one interesting difference in the Book of Mormon rendition: it uses the pronoun \"her\" to refer to both the sun and the moon, whereas the KJV uses the traditional pronoun \"his\" in reference to the sun. There is no known reason for this change.<\/p>     ",
