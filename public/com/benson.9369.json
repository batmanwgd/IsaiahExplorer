He shall neither erect nor govern his kingdom with violence or outward pomp and state, like worldly princes, but with meekness and humility.<i> He shall not lift up<\/i> \u2014 Namely, his voice;<i> nor cause<\/i> it<i> to be heard in the street<\/i> \u2014 As contentious and vain-glorious persons frequently do. \u201cHe shall instruct those that oppose themselves, with all meekness and gentleness; he shall patiently<i> endure the contradictions of sinners against himself,<\/i> and not vindicate himself against their calumnies in an angry or clamorous manner.\u201d \u2014 Lowth.<i> A bruised reed shall he not break<\/i> \u2014 He will not deal roughly or rigorously with those that come to him, but he will use all gentleness and kindness to them, bearing with their infirmities, cherishing and encouraging the smallest beginnings of grace, supporting and comforting such as are bowed down under the burden of their sins, and healing wounded consciences.<i> And the smoking flax shall he not quench<\/i> \u2014 That wick of a candle, which is almost extinct, he will not quench, but revive and kindle it again.<i> He shall bring forth judgment,<\/i> &c. \u2014 The law of God, or the doctrine of the gospel, which he will<i> bring forth unto, with,<\/i> or<i> according to truth<\/i> \u2014 That is, truly and faithfully. St. Matthew reads the clause,<i> Till he send forth judgment unto victory,<\/i> expressing not so much the words, as the sense, of the original, which seems to be, \u201ctill he make the cause of righteousness and truth completely victorious, and gloriously triumphant over all opposition.\u201d<\/p> ",
