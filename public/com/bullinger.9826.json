    "html": "<p><em>poor<\/em> = impoverished, reduced. Hebrew. <i>dal.<\/i> See note on <em>\"poverty\"<\/em> (<a class=\"ref\">Proverbs 6:11<\/a>). <\/p>\n\n<p><em>reprove<\/em> = set right, or righten. <\/p>\n\n<p><em>smite.<\/em> Same word as in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 11:15<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n<p><em>the earth.<\/em> Some codices read <i>\"driz,<\/i> <em>\"the oppressor\"<\/em>, for <i>erez<\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><\/i><\/p>\n<p><em>,<\/em> <em>\"the earth\"<\/em>. This reading is confirmed by the Structure of the clause (which is an Introversion): He shall smite the <i>oppressor<\/i> with the rod of His <i>mouth<\/i> and with the blast of His <i>lips<\/i> shall He slay the <i>lawless one<\/i>. This reading (\"oppressor\", for \"the earth \") depends on whether the first letter is <i>Aleph<\/i> (= \") or <i>Ayin<\/i> (= \"). If with the word is \"<i>erez<\/i>, earth; and if with it is <i>\"ariz,<\/i> oppression. These two letters are often interchanged. See notes on <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 28:8<\/a> (their); <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 35:15<\/a> (tear me). <a class=\"ref\">Micah 1:10<\/a> (at all). <a class=\"ref\">Hosea 7:6<\/a> (baker sleepeth). The word <i>ga\"al<\/i> (to redeem) is spelled with Aleph (\"), but it has been mistaken for <i>ga\"al<\/i> (to pollute), and is actually so rendered in <a class=\"ref\">Ezra 2:62. Nehemiah 7:64. Nehemiah 59:3; Nehemiah 63:3. Lamentations 4:14. Daniel 1:8. Zephaniah 3:1<\/a>. Mai. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 1:7<\/a>; while <i>ga\"al<\/i> is properly so rendered in <a class=\"ref\">Leviticus 26:11, Leviticus 26:15, Leviticus 26:30, Leviticus 26:43, Leviticus 26:44; 2 Samuel 1:21<\/a> (vilely = as polluted). <a class=\"ref\">Job 21:10<\/a> (faileth), <a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 14:19<\/a> (lothed), <a class=\"ref\">Ezekiel 16:45<\/a>. The word \"power\" is spelled <i>\"a<\/i> (with Aleph) in <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 76:7<\/a>, but <i>\"oz<\/i> (with Ayin (\") in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 90:11<\/a>. See further note on <a class=\"ref\">Hosea 7:6<\/a> (\"in their lying in wait\"). The <i>Massorah<\/i> contains several lists of words in which these letters are interchanged. See Ginsburg\"s <i>Massorah<\/i> (Vol. I, p. 57, letter, 514 b, and Vol. II, p. 390, letter, 352-360, &c). <\/p>\n\n<p><em>breath.<\/em> Hebrew. <i>ruach<\/i> = blast, as in <a class=\"ref\">Exodus 15:8; Exodus 25:4; Exodus 37:7. 2 Kings 19:7<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n<p><em>the wicked<\/em> = the lawless one.
