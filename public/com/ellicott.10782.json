So we have the \u201cstaff of bread\u201d in <a class=\"ref\">Leviticus 26:26; Psalms 105:16; Ezekiel 4:16; Ezekiel 5:16<\/a>. Possibly, however, the interpretation is of the nature of a marginal gloss, which has found its way into the text, and \u201cthe stay and staff\u201d (in the Hebrew the latter word is the feminine form of the former) are really identified with the \u201cpillars of the state,\u201d the great women as well as the great men who are named afterwards. On the other hand, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzE1XQ==\">Isaiah 3:7<\/a> implies the pressure of famine, and the prophet may have intended to paint the complete failure of all resources, both material and political. <\/p> ",
