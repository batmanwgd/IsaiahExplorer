In the day of their deprivation, the schemes they hatched to benefit themselves by depriving others won&rsquo;t serve to cover their crimes. As it was before the Flood, &ldquo;God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually&rdquo; (<a class=\"ref\">Genesis 6:5 <\/a>). In this repeat of history, however, Jehovah&rsquo;s alienated people are the ringleaders of injustice and the catalyst of his Day of Judgment (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzg0MyI6N30=\">Isaiah 9:13-19 <\/a>). <\/p> ",
