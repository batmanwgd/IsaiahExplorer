The <em> pual<\/em> <em> c hulla\u0302h <\/em> (only used here), \u201cto be made sickly, or powerless,\u201d signifies to be transposed into the condition of the latter, viz., the <em> Repahim <\/em> (a word which also occurs in the Phoenician inscriptions, from \u05e8\u05e4\u05d0 = \u05e8\u05e4\u05d4 , to be relaxed or weary), since the life of the shades is only a shadow of life (cf., \u03b5\u03b9\u0313\u0301\u03b4\u03c9\u03bb\u03b1 \u03b1\u0313\u0301\u03ba\u03b9\u03ba\u03c5\u03c2 , and possibly also \u03ba\u03b1\u03bc\u03bf\u0301\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2 in Homer, when used in the sense of those who are dying, exhausted and prostrate with weakness). And in Hades we could not expect anything more than this expression of extreme amazement. For why should they receive their new comrade with contempt or scorn? From <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3OTQwXQ==\">Isaiah 14:11<\/a> onwards, the singers of the mashal take up the song again.<\/p>",
