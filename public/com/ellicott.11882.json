    "html": " <p> (13) One whom his mother comforteth . . .\u2014The image of maternal love, with which the prophet\u2019s mind is full, is presented in yet another aspect. The love which Zion gives, the love which her children receive from the nations, are both but shadows of the infinite tenderness of Jehovah. In this instance the object of the mother\u2019s love that comforts is not the child at the breast, but the full-grown man, returning, like the prodigal, to his home after long years of exile. The words are characteristic at once of the special tie which unites the son to the mother, almost more than to the father, in most Eastern nations, and, perhaps also, of the prophet\u2019s personal memories of his own mother\u2019s love. <\/p> ",
