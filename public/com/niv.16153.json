But it is not clear what the significance of Ahaz\u2019s death is for the meaning of this oracle. It is possible that the date has no significance for the interpretation of the judgment on Philistia, but since there are only three datings in Isaiah (6:1; here; 20:1), that does not seem likely.<\/p>     <p>\u2003Nevertheless, the connection is unclear. If Ahaz had been a threat to the Philistines, it would be natural to say he was the broken rod who had struck the Philistines. But that is not the case. If anything the reverse was true, for 2 Chronicles 28:18 indicates that Ahaz lost several cities to the Philistines. Perhaps the date is significant because the Philistines had revolted against Assyria at this time and were urging the new king Hezekiah to join them because Assyria, \u201cthe rod that struck [us,] is broken.\u201d In 715 <small>B.C<\/small>. Sargon of Assyria was still trying to regain full control of the empire after his accession in 721, and the Philistines may have taken this prolonged struggle as a sign of weakness. If that is correct, Isaiah quickly disabuses them of such a false notion. In fact, Assyria\u2019s period of greatest strength is still in its youth and will continue to grow for another sixty years. Like Moses\u2019 staff, this \u201crod\u201d will turn into a \u201csnake,\u201d and the snake will give birth to a venomous \u201cviper\u201d (Isa. 14:29).<\/p>     <p>\u2003Verses 30 and 32 strengthen the suggestion that the Philistines are inviting the Judeans to join them in revolt. To this proposal, Isaiah answers that the Lord will take care of Judah without any help from the Philistines. Here again is the trust issue. Will Judah trust the nations or the Lord? They need not ally themselves with the Philistines because the Judeans are the flock of God, and he will tend them (14:30; see also 40:11). In fact, the great Philistines themselves will be consumed by a \u201ccloud of smoke\u2026from the north\u201d (14:31)<em>.<\/em> This refers to the Assyrian armies coming south along the coast. Since \u201cthe L<small>ORD<\/small> has established Zion,\u201d an alliance with a soon-to-be-destroyed neighbor is hardly necessary.<\/p>     <h4>Bridging Contexts<\/h4>     <p>T<small>HE ISSUE HERE<\/small> is the folly of turning away from that which is secure to depend on what is failing. The Lord\u2019s help often seems so intangible while the material and physical seems so real. Today as in ancient times, we need prophets who will help us see the real fragility of what seems on the surface to be so strong.<\/p>     <h4>Contemporary Significance<\/h4>     <p>T<small>HE CHURCH TODAY<\/small> is often in the position of Judah. We feel beleaguered on every hand, and we look for allies. Unfortunately, the allies to whom we are tempted to turn are weaker than us and in some cases are actually our enemies, just as Philistia was to Judah. We feel we need a large new facility and turn to a fund-raising consultant who has only veneered over the most cynical and manipulative methods of the world with a layer of superficial \u201cspirituality.\u201d<\/p>     <p>\u2003Yet it is \u201cZion\u201d that will survive when all the world\u2019s institutions are gone. Is it wrong \u201cto spoil the Egyptians,\u201d to raid the world for its best products? No, but the history of the church\u2019s attempts to do this is a pretty sorry one. All too often we discover that the world\u2019s \u201cbest products\u201d carry with them understandings of reality that are alien to everything the church stands for. All too often the subtle assumption on which these methods and approaches is based is that \u201cGod helps those who help themselves.\u201d Count Bismarck is reported to have said, \u201cGod is on the side of the big battalions.\u201d That is the world talking. The Bible says \u201cTrust in the L<small>ORD<\/small> with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding\u201d (Prov. 3:5). That is what Isaiah is saying.<\/p>     ",
