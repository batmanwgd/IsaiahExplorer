A prophecy of that good work of reformation with which he should  begin his reign, and the happy influence it should have upon the  people, who had been wretchedly corrupted and debauched in the reign of  his predecessor,   <a class=\"ref\"><\/a>.  II. A prophecy of the great disturbance that would be given to the  kingdom in the middle of his reign by the Assyrian invasion,   <a class=\"ref\"><\/a>.  III. A promise of better times afterwards, towards the latter end of  his reign, in respect both of piety and peace  (<a class=\"ref\"><\/a>),  which promise may be supposed to look as far forward as the days of the  Messiah.<\/p>",
