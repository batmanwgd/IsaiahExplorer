    "html": "<p>Because Jehovah&rsquo;s servant, like Moses ( <a class=\"ref\">Numbers 20:7-12<\/a>), too, transgresses, Jehovah is initially displeased with him. Still, the servant&rsquo;s role as a proxy savior of Jehovah&rsquo;s people under the terms of the Davidic Covenant requires that he answers for their disloyalties, not just his own. Jehovah&rsquo;s &ldquo;striking&rdquo; his servant&mdash;which forms a part of his descent phase before Jehovah empowers him&mdash;takes the form of the servant&rsquo;s being &ldquo;marred beyond human likeness&rdquo; by his enemies ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzExXQ==\">Isaiah 52:14<\/a>). But Jehovah &ldquo;heals him&rdquo; when the price of his own and his people&rsquo;s deliverance from destruction is paid.<\/p><p>Isaiah&rsquo;s paralleling the servant&rsquo;s &ldquo;covetousness&rdquo; with the phrase &ldquo;when he strayed by following the ways of his heart&rdquo; identifies one as synonymous with the other. God&rsquo;s prohibition of covetousness is one of the Ten Commandments: &ldquo;You shall not covet your neighbor&rsquo;s house or your neighbor&rsquo;s wife, his manservant or maidservant, neither his ox nor ass or anything of your neighbor&rdquo; ( <a class=\"ref\">Exodus 20:17; Deuteronomy 5:21<\/a>). Because covetousness is a form of idolatry ( <a class=\"ref\">Colossians 3:5<\/a>)&mdash;of wanting something that is contrary to God&rsquo;s will&mdash;it is shortsighted, distrusting of God, and self-destructive.<\/p><p>A reversal of circumstances for Jehovah&rsquo;s servant and his disciples occurs when the servant repents and fulfills his savior role ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg2NDIiOjV9LHsiMTg3NDQiOjN9LHsiMTg4NDUiOjN9XQ==\">Isaiah 49:5-9; 55:3-5; 61:1-3<\/a>). Those at home and those abroad who &ldquo;partake of the fruit of the lips&rdquo;&mdash;who receive Jehovah&rsquo;s word as his servant reveals it ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDc5LDE4NjMxLDE4NjY3LDE4NjczLDE4NzEyLDE4NzQ1XQ==\">Isaiah 41:27; 48:16; 50:4, 10; 52:15; 55:4<\/a>)&mdash;inherit &ldquo;peace,&rdquo; while the wicked, who reject Jehovah&rsquo;s word ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODE3OSwxODE4NywxODIzMF0seyIxODQ5OSI6N30sWzE4OTEwLDE4OTI3XV0=\">Isaiah 28:14, 22; 30:12; 42:18-24; 65:12; 66:4<\/a>), inherit &ldquo;no peace.&rdquo; Emulating the archtyrant&mdash;the chaotic<em>Sea<\/em> that is stirred up against Jehovah&rsquo;s people ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzcwLDE3OTk2LDE4Mzc2LDE4MzgxXQ==\">Isaiah 5:30; 17:12; 37:23, 28<\/a>)&mdash;they find no rest.<\/p> ",
