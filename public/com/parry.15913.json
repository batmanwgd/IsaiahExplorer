    "html": " <i>acceptable year of the Lord.<\/i> The New International Version reads \"the year of the Lord's favor.\"<\/p> <p> <i>day of vengeance of our God.<\/i> This day is the second coming of Christ, when he will cleanse the earth and intervene for his people Israel against their enemies (34:8; 49:8; 63:4). This cleansing applies to Israel herself, to her enemies, and to everyone who is bound spiritually. The cleansing will be accomplished quickly, as in a day<i>,<\/i> when the deliverance will be complete and the time of favor will begin. <i>The acceptable year of the Lord <\/i>subtly emphasizes his mission of saving grace. It is a long period in which the righteous enjoy the \"favor\" of the Lord (NIV). <i>Day of vengeance<\/i> reminds us that the Lord brings judgment as well as salvation. \"The contrast between <i>year<\/i> and <i>day<\/i> is important: grace is God's constant attitude toward men; vengeance is an occasional judgment necessary to remove obstacles to his grace.\" <\/p> <p><i>comfort all that mourn.<\/i> The word <i>mourning<\/i> appears three times in this passage; the mourning is for physical and spiritual captivity, as well as for the pain of sin and death. See commentary on 60:20; see also 40:1-2; 50:4; 57:18.<\/p> ",
