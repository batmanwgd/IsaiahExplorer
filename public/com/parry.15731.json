We, too, must awaken from spiritual slumbering, put off the chains of sin, and put on the \"beautiful garments\" of the priesthood. If we will come unto Christ, we can be redeemed without money.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>In the last days the Lord will reach forth to bring again a Zion state among the righteous. His followers will lift up their voices with the good news of the gospel, going forth to all nations. We can participate in that work by seeking to establish Zion in our own homes and by joining our voices in bearing testimony of Christ and his gospel.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>To be worthy to join the others of Zion, we must leave Babylon and no longer have contact with that which is unclean.<\/i><\/p> ",
