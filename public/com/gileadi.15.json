    "html": "<p>Instead of simply telling his people to repent, Israel&rsquo;s God explains <em>how<\/em> to repent. His definition involves ridding their lives of their evil actions, neither excusing nor repeating them. Of course, that includes his people&rsquo;s admitting their guilt, taking ownership of aberrant behavior. While becoming &ldquo;clean&rdquo; signifies Jehovah&rsquo;s remission of their sins, it follows only upon their living righteously. The words &ldquo;before my eyes&rdquo; signify that Jehovah sees all things, precluding the idea that his people can escape the curses of his covenant that will inevitably follow unless they speedily &ldquo;cease to do evil.&rdquo;<\/p>",
