Faultfinders on the lookout for flaws in others&mdash;who, on mere hearsay, judge them guilty&mdash;who trip others up in their words to prevent justice being served, are &ldquo;cut off.&rdquo; That is, severed from Jehovah, from his covenant blessings, and from being numbered among his people (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxNzg0NCwxODA3OF0seyIxODYzMyI6Mn1d\">Isaiah 9:14; 22:25; 48:18-19<\/a>). While the wicked create opposition that tries the faith and loyalty of the righteous, Jehovah removes them from the earth in his Day of Judgment.<\/p> ",
