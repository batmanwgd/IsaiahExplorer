Concerning Egypt, it was said, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MDA1XQ==\">Isaiah 18:7<\/a>, that it should bring gifts to the Lord at Jerusalem. Here it is predicted, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MDI0XQ==\">Isaiah 19:19<\/a>, that there shall be an altar to the Lord in Egypt itself; and that they, with the Assyrians shall become the people of God with the Israelites. This remains partly to be fulfilled. These countries shall be all, and perhaps at no very distant time from this, converted to the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ. <\/p>",
