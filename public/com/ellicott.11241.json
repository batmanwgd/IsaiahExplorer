    "html": "<p>That make a man an offender for a word . . .\u2014The words indicate that Isaiah had been accused, as Jeremiah was afterwards (<a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 37:13<\/a>), of being unpatriotic, because he had rebuked the sins of Israel and its rulers. Another interpretation gives, \u201cthat make men sinners in word,\u201d i.e., suborn false witnesses against him. The former seems preferable, but the general drift of the passage is the same. The \u201csnare\u201d was laid for the \u201crighteous man,\u201d precisely because he \u201creproved in the gate:\u201d i.e., preached in the open air in the places of public concourse, even in the presence of the rulers and judges as they sat there. <\/p>\n <p>Turn aside the just.\u2014The phrase is used in <a class=\"ref\">Exodus 23:6; Amos 5:12; Malachi 3:5<\/a>, for the deliberate perversion of justice. <\/p>\n <p>A thing of nought.\u2014The Hebrew word is once more the tohu (\u201cwithout form\u201d) of <a class=\"ref\">Genesis 1:1<\/a>. The accusations brought against the prophet were, as we say, incoherent, absolutely chaotic in their falsehood. <\/p>",
