In the previous section, 64:7 stated that \u201cno one calls on [God\u2019s] name,\u201d because \u201cyou have hidden your face from us.\u201d Isaiah 65:1 directly refutes that statement by saying that in fact God had \u201crevealed\u201d himself to people who did not call on his name. In other words, the reason they did not call on him was <em>not<\/em> because he had not revealed himself to them. He has been continually revealing himself. The problem lay in the people, not in God.<\/p>     ",
