(<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzgzXQ==\">Isaiah 6:13<\/a>.) <\/td>                 <td><i>But yet there<\/i> shall be a tenth, and <i>they<\/i> shall return, and shall be eaten, as a teil-tree, and as an oak whose substance is in them when they cast their leaves; so the holy seed shall be the substance thereof. (<a class=\"ref\">2 Ne. 16:13<\/a>.) <\/td>             <\/tr>         <\/tbody>     <\/table>     <p>This is clearly a prophecy that, although the cities of Judah will be destroyed and the inhabitants scattered, a remnant of that \"holy seed\" will return to inhabit the land. Further light is shed upon the phrase \"shall be eaten\" by a marginal reading in the KJV: \"when it is returned, and hath been broused.\" This has reference to a purging of those who are to be scattered. Isaiah's analogy of a tree's being pruned by animals eating the leaves, and by the natural casting off of the dead leaves, indicates that the tenth to return will be of a new generation. <\/p>     ",
