He speaks here, and in many other places, of the conversion of the Gentiles, with allusion to that work of gathering and bringing back the Jews from all parts where they were dispersed, into their own land. <i>And these from the land of Sinim <\/i>\u2014Either of the Sinites, as they are called, <a class=\"ref\">Genesis 10:17<\/a>, who dwelt about the wilderness; or of Sin, a famous city of Egypt, which may be put for all Egypt, and that for all southern parts. And so he here mentions the several quarters of the world where the generality of the Jews were dispersed; <i>the north,<\/i>, which is everywhere named as the chief place of their banishment and dispersion, as <a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 16:15<\/a>; and <a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 31:8<\/a>, and elsewhere; <i>the west,<\/i>, the western countries and islands; and <i>the south. Sing, O heavens,<\/i>,&c.\u2014See note on <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NTU3XQ==\">Isaiah 44:23<\/a>. <i>For the Lord hath comforted his people <\/i>\u2014God hath now sent the long-desired consolation of Israel. <\/p>",
