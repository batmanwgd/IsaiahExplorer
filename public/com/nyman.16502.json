Abraham came to the land of Canaan from Haran, in the north, and he came to Haran from Ur, in the east. The Anchor Bible (20:34) gives an interesting translation of verse 27: \"In the beginning I spoke to Zion, and to Jerusalem I will send a messenger.\" The fact that this prophecy occurs in the context of the future events which Jehovah has declared supports the interpretation of verse 1 outlined earlier in this chapter. There were none who could declare the future, as there had been none who could declare the premortal past. All was vanity and nothing, as were graven images.<\/p>     ",
