Let those dreadful judgments upon others, and God\u2019s great mercy in sparing you, awaken you to a more impartial and serious consideration of this subject, and induce you to renounce those idols which have now manifested their inability to afford any help to those who serve and trust in them. <i>They have no knowledge, <\/i>&c. \u2014 See on <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NTQzXQ==\">Isaiah 44:9<\/a>; <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODU1MSI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 44:17-18<\/a>. <i>Let them take counsel together <\/i>\u2014 To maintain the cause of their idols. See on <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDc0XQ==\">Isaiah 41:22<\/a>; and <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NTE1XQ==\">Isaiah 43:9<\/a>; and <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NTQxXQ==\">Isaiah 44:7<\/a>. <i>Look unto me, &c., all ye ends of the earth \u2014 <\/i>Upon these considerations I call upon all people, from one end of the earth to the other, to cast away their idols, and to turn their eyes and hearts to me, expecting salvation from me, and from me only; and they shall not be disappointed. And this is not only an exhortation to the Gentiles to turn from idols to God, but a prediction that they shall turn to him, and look unto Christ, who is and will be <i>the author <\/i><i>of eternal salvation to all that obey him, <\/i>whether Jews or Gentiles, which is confirmed by the following verse. <\/p>",
