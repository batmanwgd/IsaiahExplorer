Likewise, just as Moses won the attention of Israel&rsquo;s tribes in Egypt when he petitioned Pharaoh for their release, so the servant gains the attention of the Jacob\/Israel category of Jehovah&rsquo;s people at the time he fulfills his mission. A key premise of the servant&rsquo;s platform are the prophecies that foretell Jehovah&rsquo;s restoration of his people, which no one among the nations has predicted or suspected. <\/p> ",
