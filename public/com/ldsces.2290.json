    "html": " <p>A literal translation of this verse reveals the sacred names and name-titles of Deity as they are used scripturally. <\/p> <div class=\"poetry\"> <div class=\"stanza\"> <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Behold <em>El <\/em> is my salvation, <\/p> <p>I shall trust and not be afraid; <\/p> <p>For my strength and my song is <em>Yah, <\/em> Yehovah, <\/p> <p>And he has become my salvation.&rsquo; <\/p> <\/div> <\/div> <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;El&rsquo; is the singular of <em>Elohim. <\/em> It seldom occurs in the Bible in singular. In the English Bible both singular and plural are rendered by the word &lsquo;God.&rsquo; &lsquo;Yah&rsquo; is a contracted form of <em>Jehovah <\/em> or <em>Yehovah, <\/em> which in the Bible is usually rendered in English as &lsquo;LORD.&rsquo; In the King James Version here, to avoid LORD LORD, they have rendered it as LORD JEHOVAH. This is one of the few times the name is written out fully as <em>Jehovah <\/em> in the King James translation. [See also: <a class=\"ref\">Exodus 6:3; Ps. 83:18 <\/a>; <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTM1XQ==\">Isa. 26:4 <\/a>.] The short form <em>Yah <\/em> occurs in Hebrew also in <a class=\"ref\">Exodus 15:2 <\/a> and <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 118:14 <\/a>.&rdquo; (Ellis T.
