    "html": "<p>The new exodus out of Greater Babylon&mdash;out of a wicked world at its destruction (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc5MDgiOjR9LHsiMTgwNDUiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 13:1, 9, 11, 19; 21:9<\/a>)&mdash;is the signal event that separates the righteous from the wicked and sets in motion their reversal of circumstances. As Israel was born as a nation following its exodus out of Egypt&mdash;the Red Sea representing the birth canal&mdash;so Zion is born at the new exodus. Those who bear Jehovah&rsquo;s &ldquo;vessels&rdquo;&mdash;a metaphor that designates Jehovah&rsquo;s people (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgwNzciOjF9LHsiMTg5NDMiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 22:24; 66:20<\/a>)&mdash;are the spiritual kings and queens of the Gentiles who gather Jehovah&rsquo;s sons and daughters to Zion (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg1MTIiOjF9LHsiMTg2NTkiOjJ9XQ==\">Isaiah 43:6; 49:22-23<\/a>).<\/p><p>The new exodus to Zion consists of an orderly event accompanied by Jehovah&rsquo;s presence and characterized by extraordinary divine intervention. While the wicked flee in terror from the destructions that come upon them (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc5MjEiOjF9LHsiMTgwNTEiOjF9LHsiMTgxMTMiOjJ9LHsiMTgyMzUiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 13:14; 21:15; 24:17-18; 30:17<\/a>), the kings and queens of the Gentiles&mdash;those who are &ldquo;pure,&rdquo; who &ldquo;touch nothing defiled&rdquo;&mdash;lead home their charges in joyous processions from the four directions of the earth (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc4OTciOjJ9LHsiMTgyNDciOjF9LHsiMTgzMjkiOjN9LHsiMTg1MTEiOjJ9XQ==\">Isaiah 11:12, 16; 30:29; 35:8-10; 43:5-6<\/a>). Jehovah&rsquo;s presence with them marks the latter as his elect, those who have ascended to the son\/servant category of his people.<\/p>",
