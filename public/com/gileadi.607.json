    "html": " <p>The new exodus out of Greater Babylon&mdash;out of a wicked world at its destruction (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3OTA4LDE3OTE2LDE3OTE4LDE3OTI2LDE4MDQ1XQ==\">Isaiah 13:1, 9, 11, 19; 21:9 <\/a>)&mdash;is the signal event that separates the righteous from the wicked and sets in motion their reversal of circumstances. As Israel was born as a nation following its exodus out of Egypt&mdash;the Red Sea representing the birth canal&mdash;so Zion is born at the new exodus. Those who bear Jehovah&rsquo;s &ldquo;vessels&rdquo;&mdash;a metaphor that designates Jehovah&rsquo;s people (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MDc3LDE4OTQzXQ==\">Isaiah 22:24; 66:20 <\/a>)&mdash;are the spiritual kings and queens of the Gentiles who gather Jehovah&rsquo;s sons and daughters to Zion (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODUxMl0seyIxODY1OSI6Mn1d\">Isaiah 43:6; 49:22-23 <\/a>). <\/p> <p>The new exodus to Zion consists of an orderly event accompanied by Jehovah&rsquo;s presence and characterized by extraordinary divine intervention. While the wicked flee in terror from the destructions that come upon them (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxNzkyMSwxODA1MV0seyIxODExMyI6Mn0sWzE4MjM1XV0=\">Isaiah 13:14; 21:15; 24:17-18; 30:17 <\/a>), the kings and queens of the Gentiles&mdash;those who are &ldquo;pure,&rdquo; who &ldquo;touch nothing defiled&rdquo;&mdash;lead home their charges in joyous processions from the four directions of the earth (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxNzg5NywxNzkwMSwxODI0N10seyIxODMyOSI6M30seyIxODUxMSI6Mn1d\">Isaiah 11:12, 16; 30:29; 35:8-10; 43:5-6 <\/a>). Jehovah&rsquo;s presence with them marks the latter as his elect, those who have ascended to the son\/servant category of his people. <\/p> ",
