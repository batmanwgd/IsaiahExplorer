    "html": " <p>Having suffered the covenant curse of being mortally afflicted, yet faithfully submitting his life to God, Hezekiah passes the test and Jehovah heals him. According to this same pattern, Jehovah heals his end-time servant after he is &ldquo;marred beyond human likeness&rdquo; and passes <em>his <\/em> personalized test of loyalty (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg3MTAiOjJ9LHsiMTg3ODQiOjJ9XQ==\">Isaiah 52:13-14; 57:18-19 <\/a>). Fig packs and other natural means remind us that Jehovah provides remedies on the earth whereby his people may be healed&mdash;even of mortal illnesses&mdash;and live to experience a reversal of covenant curses when their lives accord with his divine laws (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzgwLDE4Nzk1XQ==\">Isaiah 6:10; 58:8 <\/a>). <\/p> <p> <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzY1NiI6MzF9\">Verses 21 <\/a> and 22 appear out of sequence in the text. From their misplacement and that of others in the Book of Isaiah it is clear that at times the entire text or parts of it were written down from memory by assigned scribes. In times of national distress, when enemies burned Jewish scriptures, such scribes could thus reproduce entire books from memory. However, when a scribe recalled a verse beyond where it was originally located, it was simply written down on the scroll at the point where he remembered it. Later scribes, fearing to alter the scripture, then simply copied the text just as they had received it. <\/p> ",
