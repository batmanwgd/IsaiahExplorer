Ephraim&rsquo;s chief sins of pride and drunkenness catch up with Israel&rsquo;s birthright tribe in Jehovah&rsquo;s Day of Judgment. Instead of acknowledging current inconvenient truths, the people of Ephraim look back on past glories earned in more righteous times as if they still apply today. Ephraim&rsquo;s self-deception, stemming from intoxication with &ldquo;wine&rdquo; at the highest levels, compounds the hard times that lie ahead (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">v 7; Isaiah 56:10-12<\/a>).<\/p>",
