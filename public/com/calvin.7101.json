When he threatens that God will cause the vine-dressers to cease to sing, he refers to an ancient custom; for when they gathered the vintage, they usually testified their joy both by dancing and by singing. Hence these words of Virgil, <i>The exhausted vine-dresser now addresses by song his farthest rows<\/i> In like manner, the sailors, when they approach the harbour, raise their shout of joy, (<span class=\"greek-hebrew\"> \u03ba\u1f10\u03bb\u03b5\u03c5\u03c3\u03bc\u03b1<\/span> ,) because, having finished their toils, and escaped dangers, they see that they have hope of obtaining some leisure or refreshment. It is as if the Prophet had said, \u201cWhen the produce of the harvest shall be taken away, nothing will be left to them but to lament their poverty.\u201d<\/p> ",
