This favored condition will be fully realized in the glorious millennial peace enjoyed by the faithful who have truly conquered Babylon (the world). (see <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTc5MzI=\">Isaiah 14:3<\/a>.) In other words, as C. F. Keil and F. Delitzsch put it, &ldquo;Babylon falls that Israel may rise&rdquo; (<em>Commentary on the Old Testament,<\/em> 7:1:306).<\/p><p class=\"cite\">LDS Church Educational System Old Testament Student Manual, 1 Kings&ndash;Malachi, Religion 302, Chapter 14, Item 12<\/p>",
