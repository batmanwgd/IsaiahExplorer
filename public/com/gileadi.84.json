For that purpose, he sends <em>righteousness<\/em> the person&mdash;his end-time servant (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3sic2luZ2xlcyI6WzE4NDU0XX0seyIxODQ3NyI6M30seyIxODQ4MiI6NH0seyIxODU5OCI6M31d\">Isaiah 41:2, 25-27; 42:1-4; 46:11-13<\/a>).

At the same time, those whose thoughts are pure, whose eyes are downcast because of the depravity of the wicked, he liberates from the vile who oppress them. In so doing Jehovah is &ldquo;exalted.&rdquo;<\/p>",
