Jehovah, on the contrary, delivered his oracles to Israel publicly and plainly.<i> I said not to the seed of Jacob, Seek ye me in vain<\/i> \u2014 Serve and worship me for naught. As I appointed them work, so from time to time I have given them abundant recompense.<i> I Jehovah speak righteousness,<\/i> &c. \u2014 That which I promise is true, and that which I command is just and good. I require nothing of my people but what is righteous in itself, and for their real advantage: whereas the idols, or their priests rather, command their worshippers to do many sinful and shameful things, even in their worship, as is most notorious. Bishop Lowth renders this clause,<i> I am Jehovah, who speak truth, who give direct answers;<\/i> observing, \u201cThis also is said in opposition to the false and ambiguous answers given by the heathen oracles; of which there are many noted examples.\u201d<\/p> ",
