As Latter-day Saints, we too can enjoy the blessings the prophets have envisioned, if our spiritual ears are not \"heavy\" and our spiritual eyes are not \"shut\" (6:10). Joseph Smith taught that \"God hath not revealed anything to Joseph, but what He will make known unto the Twelve, and even the least Saint may know all things as fast as he is able to bear them.\" Also, \"when any man obtains [the Second Comforter], he will have the personage of Jesus Christ to attend him, or appear unto him from time to time,&hellip;and the visions of the heavens will be opened unto him.\" <\/i><\/p> ",
