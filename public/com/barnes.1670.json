    "html": "<p><em>Verily thou art a God that hidest thyself<\/em> &mdash;That is, that hidest thy counsels and plans. The idea is, that the ways of God seems to be dark until the distant event discloses his purpose; that a long series of mysterious events seem to succeed each other, trying to the faith of his people, and where the reason of his doings cannot be seen. The remark here seems to be made by the prophet, in view of the fact, that the dealings of God with his people in their long and painful exile would be to them inscrutable, but that a future glorious manifestation would disclose the nature of his designs, and make his purposes known (see<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODc0OSI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 55:8-9<\/a>): &lsquo;My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways&rsquo; (compare<a class=\"ref\">Psalm 44:24<\/a> ; the notes at<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODI1XQ==\">Isaiah 8:17<\/a>).<\/p><p><em>The Saviour<\/em> &mdash;Still the Saviour of his people, though his ways are mysterious and the reasons of his dealings are unknown. The Septuagint renders this, &lsquo;For thou art God, though we did not know it, O God of Israel the Saviour.&rsquo; This verse teaches us that we should not repine or complain under the mysterious allotments of Providence. They may be dark now. But in due time they will be disclosed, and we shall be permitted to see his design, and to witness results so glorious, as shall satisfy us that his ways are all just, and his dealings right.<\/p> ",
