During the judgments of the last days, the Lord's people will focus on praising him with song, and they will experience <i>gladness of heart.<\/i> Our gladness will be similar to that experienced when a \"holy solemnity is kept,\" perhaps a reference to a sacred temple occasion such as a festival or a solemn assembly. Our gladness will be similar to the joyous ancient processions to the house (mountain) of the Lord when one would approach the mighty One of Israel accompanied by the music of an instrument such as a flute (<a class=\"ref\">2 Sam. 6:5-6<\/a>). <\/p> <p><i>mighty One of Israel. <\/i>This is a name for Jehovah<i>.<\/i><\/p> ",
