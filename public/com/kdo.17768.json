All are put to the sword. - The third and fourth disasters are plunder and ravage. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3OTIzXQ==\">Isaiah 13:16<\/a> <em> \u201cAnd their infants are dashed to pieces before their eyes, their houses plundered, and their wives ravished.\u201d<\/em> Instead of <em> tissha\u0302galna\u0302h <\/em> , the <em> keri<\/em> has the euphemistic term <em> tissha\u0302cabna\u0302h <\/em> (<em> concubitum patientur <\/em> ), a passive which never occurs in the Old Testament text itself. The <em> keri<\/em> readings <em> shuccabt <\/em> in <a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 3:2<\/a>, and <em> yishca\u0302benna\u0302h <\/em> in <a class=\"ref\">Deuteronomy 28:30<\/a>, also do violence to the language, which required \u05e2\u05dd \u05e9\u05db\u05d1 and \u05d0\u05ea (the latter as a preposition in <a class=\"ref\">Genesis 19:34<\/a>) for the sake of euphemism; or rather they introduce a later (talmudic) usage of speech into the Scriptures (see Geiger, <em> Urschrift<\/em> , pp. 407-8). The prophet himself intentionally selects the base term <em> sha\u0302gal <\/em> , though, as the queen's name <em> Shegal<\/em> shows, it must have been regarded in northern Palestine and Aramaean as by no means a disreputable word. In this and other passages of the prophecy Knobel scents a fanaticism which is altogether strange to Isaiah.<\/p>",
