Note that nothing derogatory is said about leadership by women per se, but obviously they would not be ruling with the priesthood. During Judah's dispersion among the Gentiles, there were undoubtedly many women who ruled over them, and in modern times Golda Meir served as modern Israel's prime minister.<\/p>     <p>Isaiah's statement about \"children\" oppressing Judah and causing them to err was used by Elder Ezra Taft Benson as a warning to the women of the Church against the sinful practices of birth control and abortion (see CR, Oct. 1970, p. 21).<\/p>     ",
