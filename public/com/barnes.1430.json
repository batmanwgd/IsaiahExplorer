Reeds were doubtless used often for staves, as they are now. They are light and hollow, with long joints. The idea here is, that as a slender reed would break when a man leaned on it, and would pierce his hand, so it would be with Egypt. Their reliance would give way, and their trusting to Egypt would be attended with injury to themselves (compare <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MjIzXQ==\">Isaiah 30:5<\/a> , <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MjI1LDE4MjU0XQ==\">Isaiah 30:7; Isaiah 31:3<\/a>).<\/p>",
