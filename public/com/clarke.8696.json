He like an indulgent father had carried his people in his arms, \"as a man carrieth his son,\"<a class=\"ref\">Deuteronomy 1:31<\/a> . He had protected them, and delivered them from their distresses: whereas the idols of the heathen are forced to be carried about themselves and removed from place to place, with great labor and fatigue, by their worshippers; nor can they answer, or deliver their votaries, when they cry unto them.<\/p> \n\n<p>Moses, expostulating with God on the weight of the charge laid upon him as leader of his people, expresses that charge under the same image of a parent's carrying his children, in very strong terms: \"Have I conceived all this people? have I begotten them? that thou shouldest say unto me, Carry them in thy bosom, as a nursing father beareth the sucking child, unto the land which thou swarest unto their fathers;\"<a class=\"ref\">Numbers 11:12<\/a> .<\/p> ",
