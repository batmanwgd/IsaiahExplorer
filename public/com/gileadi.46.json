Those who promote them are themselves sightless and mindless, to their own dismay. Who would fashion a god or cast an idol that cannot benefit them? Their whole society is confused; their fabricators are mere mortals. Were they all to assemble and take their stand [before me], they would at once cringe in fear&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODU0MyI6M30=\">Isaiah 44:9-11<\/a>).<\/p> ",
