And because God foresaw that this strange dispensation would provoke the Jews to murmur and quarrel with him for casting them off without sufficient cause, as indeed they were always prone to accuse him, and vindicate themselves, he bids them produce their bill of divorce. For those husbands who put away their wives out of levity or passion were obliged to give them a bill of divorce, which vindicated the wives\u2019 innocence, and declared that the husband\u2019s will and pleasure was the cause of their dismission. Now, says God, produce your bill of divorce, to show that I have put you away of my own mere will, and on a slight occasion, and that you did not first forsake me and go after other gods, and by that spiritual adultery violate the marriage covenant into which I had taken you. <i>Or which of my creditors is it to whom I have sold you <\/i>\u2014 Have I any creditors to whom I was obliged or willing to sell you for the payment of a debt? Parents, oppressed with debt, often sold their children, which, according to the law of Moses, they might do, till the year of release, <a class=\"ref\">Exodus 21:7<\/a>. See also <a class=\"ref\">2 Kings 4:1; Matthew 18:25<\/a>. But neither of these cases, says God, can be mine; I am not governed by any such motives, nor am I urged by any such necessity. <i>Behold, for your iniquities have you sold yourselves <\/i>\u2014 Your captivity and your afflictions are to be imputed to yourselves, and to your own folly and wickedness.<\/p>",
