    "html": "<p>King Ahaz&rsquo; repudiation of his vassalship to Jehovah under the terms of the Davidic Covenant in favor of vassalship to the king of Assyria (<a class=\"ref\">2 Kings 16:7<\/a>) his son Hezekiah now reverses (<a class=\"ref\">2 Kings 18:7<\/a>). Although no evidence exists that Hezekiah calls for Egypt&rsquo;s help against Assyria, the Cushite (Ethiopian) dynasty then in power in Egypt, apprised of Sennacherib&rsquo;s plans to invade Egypt, meets Assyria&rsquo;s threat to its territory (cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 37:9<\/a>). Rabshakeh&rsquo;s caricature of Egypt and its pharaoh as &ldquo;that splintered reed&rdquo; reflects Egypt&rsquo;s history of reneging on its political commitments toward other nations.<\/p>",
