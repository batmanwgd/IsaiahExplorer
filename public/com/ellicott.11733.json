    "html": "<p> (11) And of whom hast thou been afraid . . .?\u2014The question implies that Judah had been led by the fear of man to forsake the fear of Jehovah, and this had led her to what was, in the fullest sense of the word, the false step of an alliance with Assyria, which was an acted lie.<\/p> \n<p>Have I not held my peace . . .?\u2014The words suggest, half-pityingly, the cause of the people\u2019s little faith. From \u201cof old,\u201d i.e., during the period that preceded the captivity, or perhaps in the dark time of Manasseh, Jehovah had been silent, and His long- suffering had been mistaken for apathy, and therefore the people had not feared Him.<\/p> ",
