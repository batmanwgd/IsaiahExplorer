    "html": " <p>This chapter demonstrates as well as any scripture in the Old Testament the extent to which Satan has gone to achieve his eternal lie. From the beginning Lucifer said in his heart, &ldquo;I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north: I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the most High&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzk0MiI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 14:13&ndash;14 <\/a>). As Zion is the spiritual offspring of the Lord Jesus Christ, so Babylon is the evil offspring of Lucifer, who fell and became Satan, &ldquo;the father of all lies&rdquo; (<a class=\"ref\">Moses 4:4 <\/a>). The accompanying chart demonstrates how the Babylon of this world has sought to assume dominion over the children of men. <\/p> <p class=\"cite\"> LDS Church Educational System Old Testament Student Manual, 1 Kings&ndash;Malachi, Religion 302, Chapter 16, Item 40 <\/p> ",
