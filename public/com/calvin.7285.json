    "html": " <p> <i>Behold, the Lord hath a mighty and strong one. <\/i>,This may refer to the Assyrians, as if he had said, that they will be ready at God\u2019s command to fight under his authority, as soon as they shall be called. Yet I prefer to take it without a substantive, to mean either \u201ca staff,\u201d or some other instrument, by which the Lord will cast them down from this lofty pride. <\/p>,\n <p> <i>As a deluge of hail. <\/i>,He compares it to \u201ca deluge\u201d or to \u201chail,\u201d by which both herbs and flowers are thrown down, and all the beauty of the earth is marred. Thus he continues the metaphor of the \u201cfading flower,\u201d which he had introduced at the beginning of the chapter; for nothing can be more destructive to flowers than a heavy shower or \u201chail.\u201d He makes use of the demonstrative particle <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d4\u05e0\u05d4 <\/span>,, (<i>hinn\u0113h <\/i>,,) <i>behold <\/i>,; because wicked men are not moved by any threatenings, and therefore he shews that he does not speak of what is doubtful, or conjecture at random, but foretells those things which will immediately take place. <\/p>,\n <p> <i>Casting them down with the hand to the earth. <\/i> <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d1\u05d9\u05d3 <\/span>,, (<i>b\u0115y\u0101d <\/i>,,) which I have translated \u201cwith the hand,\u201d is translated by Jerome, \u201ca spacious country,\u201d which does not agree with the words. Others take it for \u201cstrength,\u201d so as to mean a violent casting down. But the plain meaning appears to me to be, that the glory and splendor of the Israelites will be laid low, as if one threw down a drunk man \u201cwith the hand.\u201d The same statement is confirmed by him in the third verse. <\/p>,",
