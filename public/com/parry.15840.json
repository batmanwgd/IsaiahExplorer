The beasts seen by Daniel in vision and used as types of worldly kingdoms came up out of the sea&hellip;. (<a class=\"ref\">Dan. 7<\/a>.) And the Lord said to Isaiah: 'The wicked are like the troubled sea&hellip;. ' (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODc4NiI6Mn0=\">Isa. 57:20-21<\/a>)\u2014leaving us to conclude that when Christ calms the seas of life, peace enters the hearts of men.\" <\/p> ",
