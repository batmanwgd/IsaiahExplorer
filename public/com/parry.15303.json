    "html": " <i>highways lie waste, the wayfaring man ceaseth. <\/i>These phrases speak of a time when battles and wars rage in the land, when civilians avoid the highways for fear of their safety, or perhaps the highways have been destroyed by armies and their artillery. All business and travel between cities ceases because no one dares to venture forth.<\/p> <p><i>he hath<\/i> <i>broken the covenant, he hath despised the cities, he regardeth no man. <\/i>Some scholars believe that <i>cities<\/i> should read \"witnesses\" here, meaning prophets or missionaries. The pronoun <i>he<\/i> in these three phrases is impersonal, and can read \"they\" or \"people,\" as in \"people have broken covenants,\" etc. The Jerusalem Bible reads, \"Treaties are broken, witnesses despised, there is respect for no one.\" The intent is to portray the general lack of integrity and love that will exist in the last days, toward both God and man.<\/p> ",
