    "html": "<p>This chapter follows a theme similar to that of the chapter preceding it. However, &ldquo;the first warning speaks against trusting the<em>wisdom<\/em> of man, and the second against trusting the<em>power<\/em> of man&rdquo; (Nyman, <em>&ldquo;Great Are the Words of Isaiah,&rdquo;<\/em> p. 118). &ldquo;Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help,&rdquo; for there is none there ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MjUyXQ==\">Isaiah 31:1<\/a>). &ldquo;The Egyptians are men, and not God&rdquo;; they themselves and those they help &ldquo;shall fail together&rdquo; ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MjU0XQ==\">v. 3<\/a>). Only the Lord can save Israel. Isaiah said, &ldquo;Turn ye unto him from whom the children of Israel have deeply revolted,&rdquo; and &ldquo;then shall the Assyrian fall with the sword, not of a mighty man,&rdquo; but of the Lord ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MjU3LDE4MjU5XQ==\">vv. 6, 8<\/a>). The &ldquo;Egyptian&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Assyrian&rdquo; of the latter days may be those in whom a modern people trust rather than in the Lord.<\/p><p class=\"cite\"> LDS Church Educational System Old Testament Student Manual, 1 Kings&ndash;Malachi, Religion 302, Chapter 15, Item 23<\/p> ",
