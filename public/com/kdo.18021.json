    "html": "<p> Having thus depicted in a few strokes the infatuation of idolatry, the prophet addresses the following question to such of the Israelites as are looking at it with longing eye, even if they have not already been deluded by it. <em> \u201cDo ye not know? Do ye not hear? Is it not proclaimed to you from the beginning? Have ye not obtained an insight into the foundations of the earth?\u201d<\/em> We have here four questions chiastically arranged. The absolute being of God, which is above all created things, is something which may be either inferred <em> per ratiocinationem <\/em> , or learned <em> per traditionem <\/em> . When Israel failed to acknowledge the absolute distinctness and unequalled supremacy of Jehovah its God, it hardened itself against the knowledge which it might acquire even in a natural way (cf., <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 19:1-14<\/a> and <a class=\"ref\">Romans 1:20<\/a>), and shut its ears against the teaching of revelation and tradition, which had come down from the very beginning of its history. The first two questions are construed with futures, the other two with perfects; the former refer to what is possible, the latter to what is an actual fact. Have you - this is the meaning of the four questions - have you obtained no knowledge of the foundations of the earth, namely, as to the way in which they were laid?<\/p>",
