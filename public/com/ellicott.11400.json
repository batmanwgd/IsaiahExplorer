    "html": "<p> (12) Mine age is departed . . .\u2014Better, my home, or habitation . . . as in <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 49:19<\/a> , and thus fitting in better with the similitude that follows. The \u201chome\u201d is, of course, the body, as the dwelling-place of the spirit. (Comp. <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 52:5<\/a> , \u201churl thee away tentless,\u201d Heb., and <a class=\"ref\">Job 21:28<\/a> , \u201cIs not their tent-cord torn away?\u201d Heb.) The \u201cshepherd\u2019s tent\u201d is the type of a transitory home ( <a class=\"ref\">2 Corinthians 5:1-4<\/a>).<\/p> \n<p>I have cut off like a weaver my life . . .\u2014The words express the feeling of one who had been weaving the web of his life with varied plans and counsels (comp. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MjE5XQ==\">Isaiah 30:1<\/a>), and now had to roll it up, as finished before its time, because Jehovah had taken up the \u201cabhorred shears\u201d to cut it from the thrum, which takes the place of \u201cwith pining sickness.\u201d There is, perhaps, a tone of reverence in the impersonal form of the statement. The sufferer will not name Jehovah as the author of his trouble.<\/p> \n<p>From day even to night.\u2014The words speak of the rapidity rather than of the prolongation of suffering. The sick man expects that death will come before the morrow\u2019s dawn.<\/p> ",
