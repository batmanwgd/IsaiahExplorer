    "html": "<p>The period of punishment has now lasted sufficiently long; it is time for Jehovah to bring forth the salvation of His people.<i> \u201cI have been silent eternally long, was still, restrained myself; like a travailing woman, I now breathe again, snort and snuff together.\u201d<\/i> The standpoint of these prophecies has the larger half of the captivity behind it. It has already lasted a long time, though only for several decades; but in the estimation of Jehovah, with His love to His people, this time of long-suffering towards their oppressors is already an \u201ceternity\u201d (see<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4Nzc3XQ==\">Isaiah 57:11<\/a> ;<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4Nzk5XQ==\">Isaiah 58:12<\/a> ;<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODQ4XQ==\">Isaiah 61:4<\/a> ;<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODg4NSI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 63:18-19<\/a> ;<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODkwXQ==\">Isaiah 64:4<\/a> , cf.,<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODk2XQ==\">Isaiah 64:10<\/a> ,<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODk3XQ==\">Isaiah 64:11<\/a>). He has kept silence, has still forcibly restrained Himself, just as Joseph is said to have done to prevent himself from breaking out into tears (<a class=\"ref\">Genesis 43:31<\/a>). Love impelled Him to redeem His people; but justice was still obliged to proceed with punishment.<br> Three real futures now take the place of imperfects regulated by<span class=\"normal hebrew\"> \u05d4\u05d7\u05e9\u05c1\u05d9\u05ea\u05d9<\/span> . They are not to be understood as denoting the violent breathing and snorting of a hero, burning with rage and thirsting for battle (Knobel); nor is<span class=\"normal hebrew\"> \u05d0\ufb49\u05c1\u05dd<\/span> to be derived from<span class=\"normal hebrew\"> \u05e9\u05c1\u05de\u05dd<\/span> , as Hitzig supposes, through a mistaken comparison of<a class=\"ref\">Ezekiel 36:3<\/a> , though the latter does not mean to lay waste, but to be waste (see Hitzig on<a class=\"ref\">Ezekiel 36:3<\/a>).

Some great thing, with which Jehovah has, as it were, long been pregnant, is now about to be born.<br><\/p> ",
