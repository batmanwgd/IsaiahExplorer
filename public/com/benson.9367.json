Their molten images are wind <\/i>\u2014 Empty and unsatisfying things, and which, like the wind, do quickly pass away and come to nothing; <i>and confusion <\/i>\u2014 Confused, useless things, like that rude heap in the beginning of God\u2019s creation, of which this word,  <span class=\"hebrew_text\">\u05ea\u05d4\u05d5<\/span>, is used, <a class=\"ref\">Genesis 1:2<\/a>. He mentions <i>molten <\/i>images particularly, because their materials were most precious, and more cost and art were commonly bestowed upon them than upon others: but under these he comprehends all images whatsoever. <\/p>",
