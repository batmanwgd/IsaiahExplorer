Their molten images are wind<\/i>\u2014Empty and unsatisfying things, and which, like the wind, do quickly pass away and come to nothing;<i>and confusion<\/i>\u2014Confused, useless things, like that rude heap in the beginning of God\u2019s creation, of which this word,<span class=\"hebrew_text\"> \u05ea\u05d4\u05d5<\/span> , is used, <a class=\"ref\">Genesis 1:2<\/a>. He mentions<i>molten<\/i> images particularly, because their materials were most precious, and more cost and art were commonly bestowed upon them than upon others: but under these he comprehends all images whatsoever.<\/p> ",
