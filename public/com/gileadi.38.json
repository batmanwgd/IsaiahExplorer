    "html": "<p>Because a society consists of the sum total of those who make it up, people&rsquo;s cumulative unrepented transgressions eventually lead to their demise. Aggrandizing man and his works debases a society. Those who tolerate or promote wickedness drag others down with them. The things of man&rsquo;s own making, in which people take pride, thus become their downfall. When self-sufficiency replaces gratitude to God, their Creator, and when the blessings of his covenants their righteous ancestors attained are taken for granted or attributed to themselves, that is the time Jehovah intervenes to humble his people.<\/p>",
