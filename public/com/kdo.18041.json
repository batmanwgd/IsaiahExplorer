    "html": "<p> Jehovah has thus placed Himself in opposition to the heathen and their gods, as the God of history and prophecy. It now remains to be seen whether the idols will speak, to prove their deity. By no means; not only are they silent, but they cannot speak. Therefore Jehovah breaks out into words of wrath and contempt. <em> \u201cBehold, ye are of nothing, and your doing of nought: an abomination whoever chooseth you.\u201d<\/em> The two \u05de\u05df are partitive, as in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDM4XQ==\">Isaiah 40:17<\/a>; and \u05de\u05d0\u05e4\u05e2 is not an error of the pen for \u05de\u05d0\u05e4\u05e1 , as Gesenius and others suppose, but \u05d0\u05e4\u05e2 from \u05e2\u05e4\u05e2 = \u05e4\u05bc\u05d4 (from which comes \u05e4\u05bc\u05d4 ), \u05e4\u05bc\u05e2\u05d4 , <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDk1XQ==\">Isaiah 42:14<\/a> (from which comes \u05d0\u05e4\u05e2\u05d4 , <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODA2XQ==\">Isaiah 59:5<\/a>), to breathe, stands as a synonym to \u05d0\u05d5\u05df , \u05d4\u05d1\u05dc , \u05e8\u05d5\u05d7 . The attributive clause \u05d1\u05bc\u05db\u05dd \u05d9\u05d1\u05d7\u05e8 (supply \u05d0\u05e9\u05c1\u05e8 \u05d7\u05d5\u05bc\u05d0 ) is a virtual subject (Ewald, \u00a7333,<em> b<\/em> ): ye and your doings are equally <em> nil<\/em> ; and whoever chooses you for protectors, and makes you the objects of his worship, is morally the most degraded of beings.<\/p>",
