Instead of the gentle waters of Shiloah lapping at their feet, they will have the floodwaters of the Assyrians reaching to their necks and stretching out as wings to cover the entire land. By referring to the land as \"Immanuel,\" meaning \"God is with us,\" Isaiah reminds the people that the promised Immanuel (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3Nzk3XQ==\">Isaiah 7:14<\/a>) will yet be born in that land. Furthermore, it is an assurance that the people will not be entirely forsaken.<\/p>",
