Throughout chapter 7\u201339, which I have entitled \u201cLessons in Trust\u201d (see outline), God through the prophet has been showing the people of Israel why they should trust him and not the nations. Now in chapters 34\u201335 the alternatives are depicted in glaring contrast. To trust the nations is to become a desert (ch. 34), but God can be trusted so that even if we have chosen the nations, he can make the desert burst forth with flowers (ch. 35). The point should be clear: Trust God!<\/p>             <p>\u2003Chapter 34 is composed of two parts. The first (vv. 1\u20134) is a general announcement of judgment on the nations of the earth. Then this announcement is particularized by applying it to the nation of Edom (vv. 5\u201317). In this case, the graphic illustration is three times as long as the general statement it illustrates.<\/p>             ",
