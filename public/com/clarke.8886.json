He then calls upon the faithful, particularly the priests and Levites, to join him, urging the promises, and even the oath, of Jehovah, as the foundation of their request,  <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODg2MSI6NH0=\">Isaiah 62:6-9<\/a>. And, relying on this oath, he goes on to speak of the general restoration promised, as already performing; and calls to the people to march forth, and to the various nations among whom they are dispersed to prepare the way for them, as God had caused the order for their return to be universally proclaimed,  <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODg2NSI6M30=\">Isaiah 62:10-12<\/a>.<\/p>",
