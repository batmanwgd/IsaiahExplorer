Bishop Lowth translates this verse: \u201cMy habitation is taken away, and is removed from me, like a shepherd\u2019s tent: my life is cut off, as by the weaver; he will sever me from the loom; in the course of the day thou wilt finish my web.\u201d Vitringa and Dr. Waterland read the verse nearly in the same manner, considering the similitude of the weaver as being continued to the end of it.<\/p>",
