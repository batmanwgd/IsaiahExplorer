    "html": "<p><em> \u201cRoaring issues from it as from the lioness: it roars like lions, and utters a low murmur; seizes the prey, carries it off, and no one rescues.\u201d<\/em> The futures, with the preceding \u05dc\u05d5 \u05e9\u05c1\u05d0\u05d2\u05d4 which is equivalent to a future, hold each feature in the description fast, as if for prolonged contemplation. The lion roars when eager for prey; and such is now the war-cry of the bloodthirsty enemy, which the prophet compares to the roaring of a lion or of young lions (<em> Cephirim <\/em> ) in the fulness of their strength. (The lion is described by its poetic name, \u05dc\u05d1\u05d9\u05d0 ; this does not exactly apply to the lioness, which would rather be designated by the term \u05dc\u05d1\u05d9\u05bc\u05d4 .) The roar is succeeded by a low growl (<em> na\u0302ham <\/em> , <em> fremere <\/em> ), when a lion is preparing to fall upon its prey.<\/p><p> (Note: In Arabic, <em> en - nehem <\/em> is used to signify greediness (see Ali's <em> Proverbs<\/em> , No. 16).)<\/p><p> And so the prophet hears a low and ominous murmur in the army, which is now ready for battle. But he also sees immediately afterwards how the enemy seizes its booty and carries it irrecoverably away: literally, \u201chow he causes it to escape,\u201d i.e., not \u201clets it slip in cruel sport,\u201d as Luzzatto interprets it, but carries it to a place of safety (<a class=\"ref\">Micah 6:14<\/a>). The prey referred to is Judah. It also adds to the gloomy and mysterious character of the prophecy, that the prophet never mentions Judah. In the following v. also (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzcwXQ==\">Isaiah 5:30<\/a>) the object is still suppressed, as if the prophet could not let it pass his lips.<\/p>",
