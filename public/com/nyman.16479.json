    "html": "          <p>Elder Joseph Fielding Smith quoted <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODMwNSI6OH0=\">Isaiah 34:1-8<\/a> to show that the Old Testament <i>prophets<\/i> spoke of the conditions of today. He supported his premise by noting that the word \"Idumea\" means the world, and that the heavenly host's being \"dissolved\" and the heavens' being \"rolled together as a scroll\" will take place in the dispensation of the fulness of times. (ST, pp. 150-51.) This is also taught in the Doctrine and Covenants and the Book of Mormon; <a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 1:36<\/a> identifies Idumea as the world, and the Savior, in teaching the Nephites, referred to the <i>time<\/i> when he would come in his glory and the earth would be \"wrapt together as a scroll\" (<a class=\"ref\">3 Ne. 26:3<\/a>). The Lord also used the language of verse 5 in the <i>preface to<\/i> the Doctrine and Covenants in referring to the day of his coming (see <a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 1:12-14<\/a>). Peter paraphrased verse 4 in his second general epistle as he proclaimed that the day of the Lord's return would come (see <a class=\"ref\">2 Pet. 3:10-13<\/a>). John, on the Isle of Patmos, also saw this future event (see <a class=\"ref\">Rev. 6:14<\/a>), and Joseph Smith referred to the time of Christ's coming as a time when the heavens \"are to be unfolded as a scroll when it is rolled up\" (TPJS, p. 29). The wording of verse 10 is similar to <a class=\"ref\">Rev. 14:11<\/a>.<\/p>     ",
