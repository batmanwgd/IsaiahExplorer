These seem to be distinguished from those who are spoken of (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4Njc1XQ==\">Isaiah 51:1 <\/a>) as following after righteousness. These had attained what the others were only in pursuit of. <i>The people in whose heart is my law <\/i>\u2014Who are here opposed to the carnal Jews, that had the law written only on tables of stone. Compare <a class=\"ref\">2 Corinthians 3:3; Hebrews 8:10 <\/a>. <i>Fear ye not the reproach of men <\/i>\u2014The censures of your carnal countrymen, who load their believing and godly brethren with a world of reproaches; but let not these things discourage you: <i>for the moth shall eat them up, <\/i> &c.\u2014Those that reproach you shall be easily and soon destroyed, and so God will avenge your cause upon them, and deliver you from their injurious treatment; <i>and the worm shall eat them like wool <\/i>\u2014Like a woollen garment, which is sooner corrupted by moths, or such creatures, than linen. <\/p> ",
