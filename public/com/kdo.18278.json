    "html": "<p> Wherever they look, joy now meets their eye. <em> \u201cAnd ye will see, and your heart will be joyful, and your bones will flourish like young herbage; and thus does the hand of Jehovah make itself known in His servants, and fiercely does He treat His enemies.\u201d<\/em> They will see, and their heart will rejoice, i.e., (cf., <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzIzLDE4ODI3XQ==\">Isaiah 53:11; Isaiah 60:5<\/a>) they will enjoy a heart-cheering prospect, and revive again with such smiling scenery all around. The body is like a tree The bones are its branches. These will move and extend themselves in the fulness of rejuvenated strength (compare <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4Nzk4XQ==\">Isaiah 58:11<\/a>, <em> et ossa tua expedita faciet <\/em> ); and thus will the hand of Jehovah practically become known (<em> v e nwd e \u201ba\u0302h <\/em> , <em> perf. cons.<\/em> ) in His servants - that hand under whose gracious touch all vernal life awakens, whether in body or in mind. And thus is it with the surviving remnant of Israel, whereas Jehovah is fiercely angry with His foes. The first \u05d0\u05ea is used in a prepositional sense, as in <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 67:2<\/a>, viz., \u201cin His servants, so that they come to be acquainted with it\u201d; the second in an accusative sense, for <em> za\u0302'am <\/em> is either connected with \u05e2\u05dc , or as in <a class=\"ref\">Zechariah 1:12; Malachi 1:4<\/a>, with the accusative of the object. It is quite contrary to the usage of the language to take both \u05d0\u05ea according to the phrase ( \u05e2\u05e1 ) \u05d0\u05ea ( \u05e8\u05e2\u05d4 ) \u05de\u05d5\u05d1\u05d4 \u05e2\u05e9\u05c2\u05d4 .<\/p>",
