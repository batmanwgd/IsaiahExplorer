The Spirit was previously rejected by Israel (see 31:3).<\/p> <p> This phrase also applies to the Restoration (<a class=\"ref\">Joel 2:28-29<\/a>; JS 1:41). During the last days, the Lord will prune his vineyard one last time, \"that I may bring to pass my strange act, that I may <i>pour out my Spirit upon all flesh<\/i>\"<sup> <\/sup>(D&amp;C 95:4). This phrase reminds us that the Lord had formerly poured out upon the people \"the spirit of deep sleep\" in 29:10 (see commentary on 29:10).<\/p> <p><i>wilderness be a fruitful field, and the fruitful field be counted for a forest.<\/i> The desolation and scattering of the people will continue until the Lord's Spirit is poured out and the people (<i>forest<\/i>) are restored to spiritual fruitfulness. This phrase recalls 29:17, which reads <i>Lebanon<\/i> instead of <i>wilderness:<\/i> \"Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field shall be esteemed as a forest.\" This verse pertains to the Restoration, after the coming forth of the Book of Mormon (see commentary on 29:29; 35:1).<\/p> ",
