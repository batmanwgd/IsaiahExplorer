God sees everywhere and every thing; but he is said<i>to look down from heaven,<\/i> because there is his throne, whereon he reigns in majesty. <i>Behold,<\/i> &c.\u2014Not barely see and look on, but behold, with regard and respect, thy poor people. <i>Where is thy zeal?<\/i>\u2014What is become of that love which of old would not let thee suffer thy people to be wronged?<i>And thy strength?<\/i>\u2014That power of thine manifested in those great acts which thou didst perform for thy people?<\/p> \n<p><i>The sounding of thy bowels<\/i>\u2014This is spoken of God after the manner of men. The meaning is, where are thy tender compassions and mercies which thou formerly showedst toward us? and which thy servants have compared to the affection that a mother bears to her children?<i>Are they restrained?<\/i>\u2014Or, canst thou be thus straitened? An expostulation that agrees well with the next verse. <i>Doubtless thou art our Father<\/i>\u2014Our only hope is in the relation we have to thee, that thou hast vouchsafed to call thyself our Father: we, therefore, as thy children, expect to find in thee the bowels and compassions of a father. <i>Though Abraham be ignorant of us<\/i>\u2014Though he who was our father after the flesh, be dead, and so ignorant of our condition. <i>And Israel acknowledge us not<\/i>\u2014Though Jacob, who also was our father, should disown us because of our degeneracy. <i>Thou, O Lord, art our Father<\/i>\u2014Thou art neither unacquainted with our state, nor wilt disown thy relation to us, but wilt continue to act the part of a father and redeemer to thy people. <i>Thy name is from everlasting<\/i>\u2014Thy gracious and merciful nature and attributes are eternal and unchangeable.<\/p> ",
