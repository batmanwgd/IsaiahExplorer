While the fulfillment of that prophecy was restricted to the ancient Americas, the prophecy of Isaiah regarding a future time when these heavenly bodies would refuse to give their light will be a worldwide event. (See <a class=\"ref\">Joel 2:10; Matthew 24:29<\/a>.) Similar but somewhat divergent prophecies are found elsewhere in scripture. (<a class=\"ref\">Revelation 6:12-14; D&amp;C 45:42; 88:87; 133:49<\/a>.) These references include the moon turning to blood and the stars falling from the heavens. There may, in fact, be multiple fulfillments of these manifestations in the heavens. And it well may be that in spite of such signs and wonders the unbelieving and skeptical will \"be less and less astonished at a sign or a wonder from heaven,\" just as occurred with some anciently.
