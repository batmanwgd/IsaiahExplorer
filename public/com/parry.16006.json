    "html": " <i>killeth an ox\/slew a man\/sacrificeth a lamb\/cut off a dog's neck.<\/i> This verse means that our sacrifices and oblations are not acceptable to God if at the same time we transgress his laws by our worship of other things or by hating our brethren. A man might sacrifice a lamb to the Lord, for example, but if he did so with an impure heart he might as well have cut through a dog's neck. A man might offer an oblation to the Lord, but if his heart was impure, he might as well have offered swine's blood, which would be abhorrent to the Lord. The parallels in this verse illustrate how men may outwardly appear to worship Jehovah while in reality continuing their sinful ways, whether outwardly or in their hearts (<a class=\"ref\">James 3:9-10<\/a>). Certainly the Lord wants our sacrifices, the outward signs of our devotion. But he also wants us to understand that outward symbols are empty without the inward devotions: obedience, repentance, humility, gratitude (1:11-13).<\/p> <p><i>they have chosen their own ways.<\/i> Isaiah speaks frequently about the way of the Lord in contrast to the way of man (55:8-9). Those who are righteous live their lives according to the laws and covenants of the gospel and by the guidance of the Spirit of the Lord (2:3; 26:7; 48:17). Others choose their own way and are condemned by the Lord (53:6; 56:11; 59:8; 65:2).<\/p> <p><i>their soul delighteth in their abominations.<\/i> Not only do these people choose to do evil works but they find delight in them. In other words, they have no remorse.<\/p> ",
