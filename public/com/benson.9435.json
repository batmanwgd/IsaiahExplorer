The prophet gives a general challenge to the idols and their worshippers, to bring proof that ever such a remarkable turn of providence as that of the Jews\u2019 restoration was foretold by any of the heathen oracles. <i>The Lord hath loved him <\/i>\u2014 Namely, Cyrus; that is, he hath done him this favour, this honour, to make him an instrument of the redemption of his people, and therein a type of the great Redeemer, God\u2019s beloved Son. <i>He will do his pleasure on Babylon<\/i> \u2014 Cyrus shall execute what the Lord hath appointed for the destruction of Babylon, and the deliverance of God\u2019s people. <i>And his arm shall be on the Chaldeans <\/i>\u2014 He shall smite and subdue them. <i>I, even I, have spoken, <\/i>&c. \u2014 Both the prediction and the execution of this great work are to be ascribed to me only. The idols had no hand therein. <i>He shall make his way prosperous <\/i>\u2014 I will give him good success in his undertaking.<\/p>",
