    "html": "<p><em>Passing over \"Leaping forward\"\u2014<\/em> The generality of interpreters observe in this place an allusion to the deliverance which God vouchsafed to his people when he destroyed the first-born of the Egyptians, and exempted those of the Israelites sojourning among them by a peculiar interposition. The same word is made use of here which is used upon that occasion, and which gave the name to the feast which was instituted in commemoration of that deliverance,<span class=\"greek-hebrew\"> \u05e4\u05e1\u05d7<\/span><span class=\"translit\"> pesach<\/span> . But the difficulty is to reconcile the commonly received meaning of that word with the circumstances of the similitude here used to illustrate the deliverance represented as parallel to the deliverance in Egypt.<\/p> \n\n<p>\"As the mother birds hovering over their young,<\/p> \n\n<p>So shall Jehovah God of hosts protect Jerusalem;<\/p> \n\n<p>Protecting and delivering, passing over, and rescuing her.\"<\/p> \n\n<p>This difficulty is, I think, well solved by Vitringa, whose remark is the more worthy of observation, as it leads to the true meaning of an important word, which hitherto seems greatly to have been misunderstood, though Vitringa himself, as it appears to me, has not exactly enough defined the precise meaning of it. He says, \"<span class=\"greek-hebrew\"> \u05e4\u05e1\u05d7<\/span><span class=\"translit\"> pasach<\/span> signifies to cover, to protect by covering:<span class=\"greek-hebrew\"> \u03c3\u03ba\u03b5\u03c0\u03b1\u03c3\u03c9 \u03c5\u0314\u03bc\u03b1\u03c2<\/span> , Septuagint. Jehovah<i> obteget ostium<\/i> ; 'The Lord will cover or protect the door:'\" whereas it means that particular action or motion by which God at that time placed himself in such a situation as to protect the house of the Israelite against the destroying angel; to spring forward, to throw one's self in the way, in order to cover and protect. Cocceius comes nearer to the true meaning than Vitringa, by rendering it<i> gradum facere<\/i> , to march, to step forward; Lexicon in voc. The common meaning of the word<span class=\"greek-hebrew\"> \u05e4\u05e1\u05d7<\/span><span class=\"translit\"> pasach<\/span> upon other occasions is to halt, to be lame, to leap, as in a rude manner of dancing, (as the prophets of Baal did,<a class=\"ref\">1 Kings 18:26<\/a> ;), all which agrees very well together; for the motion of a lame person is a perpetual springing forward, by throwing himself from the weaker upon the stronger leg. The common notion of God's passage over the houses of the Israelites is, that in going through the land of Egypt to smite the first-born, seeing the blood on the door of the houses of the Israelites, he passed over, or skipped, those houses, and forbore to smite them. But that this is not the true notion of the thing, will be plain from considering the words of the sacred historian, where he describes very explicitly the action: \"For Jehovah will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when he seeth the blood on the lintels and on the two side posts, Jehovah will spring forward over (or before) the door,<span class=\"greek-hebrew\"> \u05d4\u05e4\u05ea\u05d7 \u05e2\u05dc \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d4 \u05d5\u05e4\u05e1\u05d7<\/span><span class=\"translit\"> upasach Yehovah al happethach<\/span> , and will not suffer the destroyer to come into your houses to smite you, \"<a class=\"ref\">Exodus 12:23<\/a> . Here are manifestly two distinct agents, with which the notion of passing over is not consistent, for that supposes but one agent. The two agents are the destroying angel passing through to smite every house, and Jehovah the Protector keeping pace with him; and who, seeing the door of the Israelite marked with the blood, the token prescribed, leaps forward, throws himself with a sudden motion in the way, opposes the destroying angel, and covers and protects that house against the destroying angel, nor suffers him to smite it. In this way of considering the action, the beautiful similitude of the bird protecting her young answers exactly to the application by the allusion to the deliverance in Egypt. As the mother bird spreads her wings to cover her young, throws herself before them, and opposes the rapacious bird that assaults them, so shall Jehovah protect, as with a shield, Jerusalem from the enemy, protecting and delivering, springing forward and rescuing her;<span class=\"greek-hebrew\"> \u03c5\u0314\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b2\u03b1\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd<\/span> , as the three other Greek interpreters, Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion, render it.
