The time frame for the prophecy, at least with regard to 19:16-25, is the last days, as indicated by the expression in that day (19:16, 18, 19, 21, 23). Thus those of us who are permitted to live in the final decades before the coming of the Savior may witness the events of this chapter. Egypt as referred to herein may be the literal nation in Africa, or may symbolize one or more unidentified latter-day nations.<\/i><\/p> ",
