    "html": "<p><em>whom the Lord of hosts shall bless<\/em>&mdash;That is, which united country he shall acknowledge as truly worshipping him, and on which he shall bestow his favors as his favored people.<\/p><p><em>Assyria the work of my hands<\/em>&mdash;This is synonymous with the expression &lsquo;my people.&rsquo; It means that the arrangements by which the true religion would be established among them, were the work of God. Conversion to God is everywhere in the Scriptures spoken of as his work, or creation; see <a class=\"ref\">Ephesians 2:10<\/a> : &lsquo;For we are his workmanship; created in Christ Jesus unto good works&rsquo; (compare <a class=\"ref\">2 Corinthians 5:17; Psalm 100:3<\/a>).<\/p><p><em>Israel mine inheritance<\/em>&mdash;The land and people which is especially my own&mdash;a name not unfrequently given to Israel. For a learned examination of the various hypotheses in regard to the fulfillment of this prophecy, see Vitringa. He himself applies it to the times succeeding Alexander the Great. Alexander he regards as the &rsquo;saviour&rsquo; mentioned in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 19:20<\/a>; and the establishment of the true religion referred to by the prophet as that which would take place under the Ptolemies. Vitringa has proved&mdash;what indeed is known to all who have the slightest knowledge of history that there were large numbers of Jews under the Ptolemies in Egypt, and that multitudes became proselytes to the Jewish faith.<\/p>",
