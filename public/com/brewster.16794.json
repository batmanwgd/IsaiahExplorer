Through its touch, Isaiah's sins were \"purged\" and he was sanctified to perform God's work. The \"live [hot] coal\" could well be symbolic of being \"cleansed by the power of the Holy Ghost,\" which, or course, was made possible through the Atonement. (<a class=\"ref\">Moroni 6:4<\/a>.) The altar Isaiah saw was probably the altar of incense inside the temple. The Hebrew word for \"live coal\" is <i>ritzpah,<\/i> translated as a \"glowing (incandescent) stone.\" (See IPSP, 131.)<\/p>",
