    "html": " <p>From addressing his people personally as &ldquo;Israel... my people&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NjU4XQ==\">v 3<\/a>), Jehovah now addresses them impersonally as &ldquo;a nation,&rdquo; signifying their alienated state. Additionally, a regression occurs from his people&rsquo;s simply going &ldquo;astray&rdquo; to their burdening themselves with &ldquo;sin,&rdquo; which, over time, ends in outright &ldquo;wrongdoing.&rdquo; That occurs collectively and generationally. The &ldquo;offspring of wrongdoers&rdquo; turn into &ldquo;perverse children,&rdquo; meaning that the rising generation has by now become thoroughly corrupt. &ldquo;Forsaking&rdquo; Jehovah and &ldquo;spurning&rdquo; him finally become conscious and deliberate acts. <\/p> <p> <em>The Holy One of Israel. <\/em> The title of &ldquo;Holy One,&rdquo; together with &ldquo;Valiant One&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3Njc5XQ==\">v 24<\/a>) designates Israel&rsquo;s God more than thirty times in the Book of Isaiah. In this case, it contrasts Jehovah&rsquo;s holiness with his people&rsquo;s unholiness. Still, it points to what Jehovah&rsquo;s people should become&mdash;&ldquo;holy&rdquo; or &ldquo;sanctified,&rdquo; like their God. Both titles&mdash;&ldquo;Holy One&rdquo; and &ldquo;Valiant One&rdquo;&mdash;characterize Israel&rsquo;s God as his people&rsquo;s exemplar. We observe this in an instance in which Jehovah exempts a righteous remnant of his people called his &ldquo;holy ones&rdquo; and &ldquo;valiant ones&rdquo; from a worldwide destruction (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3OTEwXQ==\">Isaiah 13:3<\/a>). <\/p> <p> <em>They have lapsed into apostasy. <\/em> Hebrew <em>nazoru ahor <\/em> signifies that Jehovah&rsquo;s people have become entirely &ldquo;estranged&rdquo; from him. They have &ldquo;gone backwards&rdquo; to what they used to be before they became Jehovah&rsquo;s covenant people, when they didn&rsquo;t know their God. In effect, they have become godless again like the world&rsquo;s heathen nations, but now more so because they have rejected the light they once had. The apostasy into which they began to backslide a generation ago is now complete. As a consequence, instead of enjoying the blessings of the covenant, they must suffer its curses. <\/p> ",
