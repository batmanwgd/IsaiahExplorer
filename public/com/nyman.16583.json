Abinadi also equated verses 5 and 6 with the breaking of the bands of death and with Christ's taking upon himself the iniquities and transgressions of all people. In other words, Abinadi taught that these verses foretold the Savior's resurrection and atonement (see <a class=\"ref\">Mosiah 15:8-9<\/a>). Paul also gave this interpretation (see <a class=\"ref\">Rom. 4:24-25<\/a>), as did Peter (see <a class=\"ref\">1 Pet. 2:24-25<\/a>; compare <a class=\"ref\">Mosiah 3:7; Alma 7:12-13<\/a>).
