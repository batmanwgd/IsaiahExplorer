Behold, thus saith the Lord: It is a servant in the hands of Christ, who is partly a descendant of Jesse as well as of Ephraim, or of the house of Joseph, on whom there is laid much power\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 113:3-4<\/a>). Sidney Sperry suggested that the <i>rod<\/i> or \"servant in the hands of Christ\" referred to the Prophet Joseph Smith. It may also refer to another latter-day prophet yet to come forth.<\/p> <p><i>stump of Jesse<\/i> (KJV, <i>stem of Jesse<\/i>). The <i>stump of Jesse<\/i> is Christ. The Doctrine and Covenants is explicit: \"Who is the Stem of Jesse spoken of in the 1st, 2d, 3d, 4th, and 5th verses of the 11th chapter of Isaiah? Verily thus saith the Lord: It is Christ\" (113:1-2).<\/p> <p><i>Branch.<\/i> Elder Bruce R. McConkie explained that the Branch is Christ: \"As to the identity of the Stem of Jesse, the revealed word says: 'Verily thus saith the Lord: It is Christ.' (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 113:1-2<\/a>.) This also means that the Branch is Christ\" (<a class=\"ref\">Jer. 23:3-6; Zech. 3:8<\/a>). <\/p> ",
