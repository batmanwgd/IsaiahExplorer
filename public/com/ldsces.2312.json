    "html": " <p>All the powers of the world, including the neighbors of Judah as well as the nations of the world that despoiled the Lord&rsquo;s people, will themselves be destroyed by the mighty judgments of God. (Syria is represented by &ldquo;Damascus,&rdquo; and the Northern Kingdom of Israel is represented by the mountain defense of Ephraim.) Both Israel and the nations of the world are humbled by the hand of God. Yet the Lord promises, in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzk5MCI6M30=\">Isaiah 17:6&ndash;8 <\/a>,, that a remnant of these nations, like the Israelites, will also be preserved. &ldquo;Gleaning grapes&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3OTkwXQ==\">v. 6 <\/a>) are those few missed by the harvesters, and olives were harvested by shaking the branches, which always left a few scattered fruits in the topmost branches (see <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3OTkwXQ==\">v. 6 <\/a>). Also like Israel, this remnant of the Gentiles will turn to God and forsake their false religions (see <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzk5MSI6Mn0=\">vv. 7&ndash;8 <\/a>). <\/p> <p class=\"cite\">,LDS Church Educational System Old Testament Student Manual, 1 Kings&ndash;Malachi, Religion 302, Chapter 14, Item 23 <\/p>,",
