The \u201ckings will serve you\u201d (60:10), and if not, their \u201ckingdom\u2026will be utterly ruined\u201d (60:12). This seems to stand in contradiction to such statements as 2:1\u20135; 56:1\u20138; and 66:20\u201323 (not to mention 60:6, 9), which have the nations as equal participants in the worship of the Lord. Probably two points are being made. (1) As Isaiah has said throughout the book (e.g., 10:5\u201332), those who oppress God\u2019s people, even as an instrument in his hand, are accountable for their behavior. Thus, the day will come when there will be a complete reversal, in that the oppressors will become servants of a redeemed people. Sin will be punished.<\/p>     <p>\u2003(2) A choice is implied in the two kinds of passages. If one does not choose to become a participant in worship with God\u2019s redeemed people, the only other option is to become their servants. The option of continuing to be their oppressors will no longer exist. But notice again that the service is not finally given for the aggrandizement of Zion. Instead, it is given \u201cto adorn the place of my sanctuary\u201d (60:13; cf. 60:7). The service is given to Zion for the Lord, because she is \u201cZion of the Holy One of Israel.\u201d It is when God\u2019s people have truly laid aside their own self-seeking through the work of the divine warrior (59:15a\u201321; 63:1\u20136) and exist for God\u2019s glory alone that all these by-products come flowing to them.<\/p>     ",
