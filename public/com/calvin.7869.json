    "html": "<p><i>And those dogs strong of appetite. <\/i> The third vice which he remarks in wicked pastors is insatiable avarice. Though they are lazy in all that relates to good government, yet they have a strong and ravenous appetite for food. Some view the Prophet\u2019s words as still more extensive, and as meaning that they rule tyrannically. Ezekiel expressly reproves them for this vice; for false prophets are commonly fierce, and act cruelly and barbarously towards the people of God. ( <a class=\"ref\">Ezekiel 34:4<\/a>) But if any person examine the matter carefully, he will perceive that the Prophet speaks of their insatiable avarice, which he afterwards describes by a variety of expressions.<\/p> \n<p><i>They look to their ways. <\/i> That is, \u201cThey attend eagerly to their own affairs; every person consults his own advantage.\u201d In short, he means that there is no man who does not wish to be preferred to others, as if every man had been born for himself.<\/p> \n<p><i>Every one to his gain from his end. <\/i><span class=\"greek-hebrew\"> \u05de\u05e7\u05e6\u05d4\u05d5<\/span> (<i>mikkatzehu<\/i>) has received various expositions. Some render it, \u201cIn his end,\u201d that is, \u201cIn his affairs;\u201d as if the reading had been,<span class=\"greek-hebrew\"> \u05d1\u05e7\u05e6\u05d4\u05d5<\/span> , (<i>bekatzehu<\/i>) But this does not agree with the Prophet\u2019s meaning. Others render it, \u201cFrom the end of his avarice.\u201d I think that a more simple interpretation is, \u201cFrom his end,\u201d that is, \u201cOn his part;\u201c or as we commonly say, (<i>Chacun en son endroict<\/i> ,) \u201cEvery one in his place.\u201d Thus every one is bent on avarice, and draws and appropriates everything to himself, and consults his own advantage, without attending to the duties of his office.<\/p> \n<p>Hence we learn, that no man can serve God who is given up to wicked desires; and he who shall labor to amass wealth, will not apply his mind to build up the Church of the Lord. No kind of blindness can be more dangerous than avarice; and so much the more ought it to be avoided by pastors, if they wish to be faithful servants of God. When we see the Prophet complaining of the bad pastors of his time, let us not be alarmed if we meet with the same thing in the present day, and let us not look upon it as an unusual occurrence that so few are earnestly employed in the work of the Lord.<\/p> \n\n\u201cLiterally, \u2018From his extremity.\u2019 Jerome correctly renders it, \u2018From first to last,\u2019 that is, without any exception; and that is the meaning which the word bears in <a class=\"ref\">Genesis 19:4; Ezekiel 33:2<\/a>.\u201d \u00ad<i>Rosenmuller<\/i><span> . \n\u201cAll to a man.\u201d \u00ad<\/span><i>Doederlein<\/i> .",
