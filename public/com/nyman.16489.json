Moses, after being shown the world and the ends thereof, came to the same conclusion (see <a class=\"ref\">Moses 1:7-10<\/a>). And King Benjamin taught his subjects that they should always remember the greatness of God and their own nothingness (see <a class=\"ref\">Mosiah 4:11<\/a>). Paul paraphrased verse 13, and possibly verse 14, in proclaiming the wisdom and knowledge of God:<\/p>     <table>         <tbody>             <tr>                 <td>Who hath directed the Spirit of the Lord, or being his counsellor hath taught him?<\/td>                 <td>O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchahle are his judgments, and his ways past finding out!<\/td>             <\/tr>             <tr>                 <td>With whom took he counsel, and who instructed him, and taught him in the path of judgment, and taught him knowledge, and shewed to him the way of understanding?
