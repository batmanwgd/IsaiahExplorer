A whole nation are called to fast to implore God's blessing on wars carried on for the purposes of wrath and ambition.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>To smite with the fist of wickedness: ye shall not fast as ye do this day \"To smite with the fist the poor. Wherefore fast ye unto me in this manner\" -<\/em>I follow the version of the Septuagint, which gives a much better sense than the present reading of the Hebrew. Instead of <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05dc\u05d0 \u05e8\u05e9\u05e2 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">resha lo<\/span>, they seem to have read in their copy <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05dc\u05d9 \u05de\u05d4 \u05e2\u05dc \u05e8\u05e9 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">rash al mah lli<\/span> . The four first letters are the same, but otherwise divided in regard to the words; the four last are lost, and <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d0 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">aleph<\/span>  added in their place, in order to make some sort of sense with <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05dc \u05e8\u05e9\u05e2 <\/span> .
