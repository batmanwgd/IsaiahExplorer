It is significant, as pointing to some widely-diffused legend, that the Persian name for the constellation is Nimrod and the Arabian Giant. In Greek mythology Orion is a giant hunter, conspicuous for acts of outrage against the gods, and finally slain by Zeus. It is obvious that the words in their first application had a figurative, and not a literal, fulfilment. Such imagery has been at all times the natural symbolism of a time of terror (<a class=\"ref\">Joel 2:31; Joel 3:15; Matthew 24:29; Mark 13:24; Luke 21:25<\/a>). <\/p> ",
