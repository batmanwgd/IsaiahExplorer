    "html": "          <p>In quoting parts of these verses, Bishop Vandenberg inserted several interpretive comments. The text is here quoted with his comments as he inserted them:<\/p>     <blockquote>... If thou take away from... thee the yoke, (or wickedness) the putting forth of the finger, (or accusing others) and speaking vanity;<\/blockquote>     <blockquote>And if thou draw out thy soul to the hungry, and satisfy the afflicted soul; then shall thy light rise in obscurity, and thy darkness be as the noon day:<\/blockquote>     <blockquote>And the Lord shall guide thee continually, (or the Holy Ghost will direct your daily life) and satisfy thy soul in drought, (This is your personal security in times of need and difficulty.) and make fat thy bones: (I believe this has to do with health. In the bone there is marrow and marrow manufactures the blood that is vital to the strength and well-being of the body.) and thou shalt be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters fail not (or inspiration and wisdom will flow from you continually). (CR, Apr. 1963, p. 29.)<\/blockquote>     <p>Bishop Brown interpreted these three verses to mean \"To humble and prepare ourselves to communicate with the Lord\" <i>(Ensign,<\/i> Nov. 1977, p. 83).<\/p>     ",
