The Word \u201cbuy\u201d is elsewhere confined to the purchase of corn, and would not rightly have been used of wine and milk. The invitation is addressed, as in a tone of pity, to the bereaved and afflicted one of <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODczMCI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 54:6-7<\/a>.<\/p>\n <p>Without money and without price.\u2014\u201cLiterally, For not-money and not-price. The prophet had used the word \u201cbuy,\u201d but he feels that that word may be misinterpreted. \u201cNo silver or gold can buy the blessing which He offers. Something, indeed, is required, and therefore the word\u201d buy \u201cis still the right word; but the \u201cprice\u201d is simply the self-surrender that accepts the blessing.
