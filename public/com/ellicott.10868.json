And the witnesses whom the prophet calls were probably men of high position, among those who had been foremost in advising the alliance with Assyria. Of Uriah or Urijah, the priest, we know that he complied with the king\u2019s desire to introduce an altar after the pattern which he had seen at Damascus (<a class=\"ref\">2 Kings 16:10-11<\/a>). Of Zechariah we know nothing; but the name was a priestly one (<a class=\"ref\">2 Chronicles 24:20<\/a>), and it has been conjectured, from his association with Isaiah, that he may have been the writer of a section of the book that bears the name of a later Zechariah (Zechariah 9-12), which bears traces of being of a much earlier date than the rest of the book. The combination of \u201cZachariah, son of Jeberechiah\u201d reminds us of Zacharias, the son of Barachias, and points to a priestly family. (See Note on <a class=\"ref\">Matthew 23:35<\/a>.) In <a class=\"ref\">2 Chronicles 29:13<\/a> the name appears as belonging to the Asaph section of the Levites. A more probable view is that he was identical with the father of the queen then reigning, and was therefore the grandfather of Hezekiah (<a class=\"ref\">2 Chronicles 29:1<\/a>). Probably, looking to the prophet\u2019s habit of tracing auguries in names, the two witnesses may have been partly chosen for the significance of those which they bore, Uriah, i.e., \u201cJah is my light,\u201d Zechariah, i.e., \u201cJah will remember,\u201d each of which comes in with a special appropriateness. <\/p> ",
