    "html": "<p>The &ldquo;potentates&rdquo; and &ldquo;authorities&rdquo; of the world wield power over men and oppress them. In the end, however, Jehovah makes them &ldquo;null and void,&rdquo; reducing them to &ldquo;nought,&rdquo; signifying their de-creation into chaos. Because God intends the earth to be a place where his children can grow to maturity by learning from their own experience to know good from evil (<a class=\"ref\">Genesis 3:22<\/a>), the wicked who abuse their authority and tyrannize others provide the very opposition that enables the righteous to grow. While Jehovah affords all the same chance to ascend spiritually, some choose to descend and perish.<\/p><p>Storm imagery and withering vegetation denotes Jehovah&rsquo;s Day of Judgment (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3OTY3LDE4Mjg5LDE4NDk2XQ==\">Isaiah 15:6; 33:9; 42:15<\/a>), the <em>stock<\/em> alluding to the king of Assyria\/Babylon, the paragon of tyrants and oppressors (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc4NTYiOjN9LHsiMTc5MzMiOjN9LHsiMTgzNzkiOjJ9XQ==\">Isaiah 10:5-7; 14:4-6; 37:26-27<\/a>).

In the end, Jehovah turns him and all tyrants into &ldquo;chaff&rdquo;&mdash;into chaos or nonentities (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3sic2luZ2xlcyI6WzE4MTk5XX0seyIxNzk5NiI6M30seyIxODQ2NiI6M31d\">Isaiah 17:12-14; 29:5; 41:14-16<\/a>).<\/p>",
