But Lowth, more correctly, regards it as referring to the Gentiles. It is designed as an argument to show the superiority of God over all idols, and to demonstrate that he was able to deliver his people from captivity and exile. He appeals, therefore <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 43:9<\/a> , to his own people in proof of his divinity and power. None of the pagan <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 43:8<\/a> had been able to predict future events, none of the pagan gods, therefore, could save; but Yahweh, who had so often foretold events that were fulfilled, was able to deliver, and of that fact his own people had had abundant evidence.<\/p><p><em>That have eyes<\/em>&mdash;They had natural faculties to see and know God (compare <a class=\"ref\">Romans 1:20<\/a> ), but they had not improved them, and they had, therefore, run into the sin and folly of idolatry. The phrase &lsquo;bring forth,&rsquo; implies a solemn appeal made by God to them to enter into an argument on the subject (compare the note at <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 41:1<\/a>).<\/p>",
