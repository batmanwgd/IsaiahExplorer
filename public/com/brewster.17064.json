While such a statement might naturally turn our attention to the commandment that we should \"not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain\" (<a class=\"ref\">Exodus 20:7<\/a>), it is of interest to note the words of the Lord's covenant with the great patriarch Abraham: \"I will take thee, to put upon thee <i>my name,<\/i> even the <i>Priesthood<\/i> of thy father.\" (<a class=\"ref\">Abraham 1:18<\/a>; italics added.)<\/p>     <p>Israel was chosen to be a \"kingdom of priests, and an holy nation\" (<a class=\"ref\">Exodus 19:6<\/a>), and God would not allow His priesthood to be polluted. The apostle Peter reminded Israel in his day that they were a \"royal priesthood, an holy nation.\" (<a class=\"ref\">1 Peter 2:9<\/a>.) And, in our day, the Lord has warned that the rights of the priesthood can be controlled only \"upon the principles of righteousness.\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 121:36<\/a>.) Those who receive the priesthood are given a stewardship of trust, which, if violated, will be withdrawn, for the Lord will not suffer His name to be polluted.<\/p>",
