It is viewed as an extension of the previous three chapters and as a transition to <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzQ2XQ==\">Isaiah 6<\/a>. The chapter can logically be divided into three sections: (1) verses 1-7 describe the parable of the Lord's vineyard; (2) verses 8-25 pronounce six woes upon the wicked; and (3) verses 26-30 prophesy of a future time when the Lord will lift up an ensign to the nations of the world and gather His people.<\/p>",
