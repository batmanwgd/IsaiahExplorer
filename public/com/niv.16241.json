It is a call to praise, in which the \u201cheavens\u201d and the \u201cearth,\u201d which at the beginning of the book were called to witness Israel\u2019s rebellion (1:2), are now called to rejoice over the salvation promised in 44:21\u201322 and revealed with more clarity in 44:24\u201345:7. The rest of nature (\u201cmountains,\u201d \u201cforests,\u201d and \u201ctrees\u201d) is then commanded to join in the song of redemption. In this visual (and auditory) way, Isaiah emphasizes again that the Creator of the world is the only One who can redeem the world. Also, nature, in whom God\u2019s creative \u201cglory\u201d is seen, is called upon to praise God for his greater redemptive \u201cglory\u201d that will be displayed \u201cin Israel.\u201d Truly his glory fills the earth (cf. 6:3).<\/p>     ",
