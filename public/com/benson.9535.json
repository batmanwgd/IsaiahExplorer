By <i>blood,<\/i>, we are to understand, either murders and bloodshed, properly so called, or ways of injustice, extortion, oppression, and cruelties, whereby men are deprived of a livelihood: hence, hating our brother is called murder, <a class=\"ref\">1 John 3:15<\/a>, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem murderers, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3Njc2XQ==\">Isaiah 1:21<\/a>. <i>And your fingers with iniquity <\/i>\u2014This is added to aggravate their sin; as if he had said, Not only your hands, but your fingers are defiled, and not the least part of you is free from injustice. <i>Your lips have spoken lies \u2014<\/i>, Not only properly so called, but perjuries, slanders, and false accusations: you have not only offered violence to your neighbours by your hands, but circumvented them by your lips. <i>Your tongue hath muttered perverseness <\/i>\u2014Perverse words, or such as were contrary to God\u2019s word and will. When they could not, for shame, utter their malice against their neighbours aloud, nor dared to do it for fear of being convicted of falsehood, and put to confusion, they muttered it secretly. <\/p>",
