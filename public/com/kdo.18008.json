    "html": "<p> The cry of the crier proceeds thus in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDI2XQ==\">Isaiah 40:5<\/a> : <em> \u201cAnd the glory of Jehovah will be revealed, and all flesh seeth together: for the mouth of Jehovah hath spoken it.\u201d<\/em> The pret. cons. \u05e7\u05e0\u05d2\u05dc\u05d4 is here <em> apodosis imper<\/em> . When the way is prepared for Jehovah the Coming One, the glory of the God of salvation will unveil itself (on the name <em> Jehovah<\/em> , which is applied to God, the absolute I, as living and revealing Himself in history, more especially in the history of salvation). His <em> parousia<\/em> is the revelation of His glory (<a class=\"ref\">1 Peter 4:13<\/a>). This revelation is made for the good of Israel, but not secretly or exclusively; for all the human race, called here designedly \u201call flesh\u201d (<em> kol <\/em> <em> ba\u0302sa\u0302r <\/em> ), will come to see it (compare <a class=\"ref\">Luke 3:6<\/a>, \u201cthe salvation of God\u201d). Man, because he is flesh, cannot see God without dying (<a class=\"ref\">Exodus 33:20<\/a>); but the future will fill up this gulf of separation. The object to the verb \u201csee\u201d is not what follows, as Rosenm\u00fcller supposes, viz., \u201cthat the mouth of Jehovah hath spoken,\u201d for the word of promise which is here fulfilled is not one addressed to all flesh; nor does it mean, \u201csee that Jehovah hath spoken with His own mouth,\u201d i.e., after having become man, as Stier maintains, for the verb required in this case would be \u05de\u05d3\u05d1\u05bc\u05e8 , not \u05d3\u05bc\u05d1\u05bc\u05e8 . The clause, \u201cfor the mouth of Jehovah hath spoken it,\u201d is rather Isaiah's usual confirmation of the foregoing prophecy. Here the crier uses it to establish the certainty of what he foretells, provided that Israel will do what he summons it to perform.<\/p>",
