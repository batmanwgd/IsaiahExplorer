Or, \u201cI have made a particular choice of thee for my peculiar people, and singled thee out from the rest of the world, and ever since have treated thee with uncommon instances of kindness and familiarity.\u201d <i>When thou passest through the waters, <\/i>&c. \u2014 \u201cI will support and deliver thee when thou art in the greatest straits and difficulties. To <i>pass through fire and water <\/i>is a proverbial expression, to signify being exposed to all kinds of dangers.\u201d <i>Thou shalt not be burned,<\/i> &c. \u2014 Though I will chastise thee for thy sins, yet I will not suffer thine enemies utterly to destroy thee. <\/p>\n<p><\/p>",
