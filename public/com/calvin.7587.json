    "html": "<p><i> Who hath declared from the beginning?<\/i> Again the Lord attacks idols, after having maintained his divinity; for he asks if idolaters can produce anything of a similar nature to support their worship; that is, if they can bring forward any such instance of foreknowledge or power. And because beyond all controversy he could claim this prerogative for himself alone, he tauntingly says, \u201cWe will acknowledge that he by whom such things shall be done is the true God.\u201d<\/p> \n<p><i> We will say he is righteous.<\/i> This is the literal rendering, but the word \u201crighteous\u201d has an extensive meaning, and sometimes denotes \u201ctrue and approved;\u201d hence the saying, \u201cWisdom is justified,\u201d that is, approved, \u201cby her children.\u201d (<a class=\"ref\">Matthew 11:19<\/a> .) These are then clear proofs of the divine majesty, which demonstrate the vanity of idols, because by the disposal of God alone all things are governed, and by the slightest expression of his will the mightiest monarchies are overthrown. The Lord speaks in the plural number, in order to shew that he does not defend his own cause, but the cause of the whole nation. He is, indeed, satisfied with his own eternity; but as we are weak, it is therefore necessary that it should be proved to us that he is God, that our minds may not go astray, or wander in uncertainty, but may rest entirely upon him; and therefore to the word is added experimental knowledge, that it may more fully support our faith, if it should still be liable to waver.<\/p> \n<p><i> There is none that heareth your words.<\/i> He says that the idols are dumb, and leave their worshippers in suspense, while he kindles the torch of his word, to enlighten his elect people, and lead them forward to righteous judgment.<\/p> ",
