Have I not from time to time added new conquests to the old? None of those cities, against which he had turned his arms, had been able to resist him; but he had subjugated them all. Calno, Carchemish, Hamath, and Arpad, were cities of Syria and Israel, which this mighty monarch had subdued. <i>Is not Samaria <\/i>\u2014 Or, <i>Shall not Samaria be, as Damascus? <\/i>\u2014 Shall I not take that as I have done this city? For although Damascus, possibly, was not yet taken by the Assyrians, yet the prophet speaks of it as actually taken, because these words are prophetically delivered, and supposed to be uttered by the king of Assyria, at or about the time of the siege of Samaria, when Damascus was taken. <i>As my hand hath found <\/i>\u2014 Hath taken, as this word is often used, <i>the kingdoms of the idols <\/i>\u2014 Which worshipped their own idols, and vainly imagined that they could protect them from my power. He calls the gods of the nations, not excepting <i>Jerusalem, idols, <\/i>by way of contempt, because none of them could deliver their people out of his hands, and because he judged them to be but petty gods, far inferior to the sun, which was the god of the Assyrians. <i>Whose graven images did excel them of Jerusalem <\/i>\u2014 Namely, in reputation and power. Which blasphemy of his proceeded from his deep ignorance of the true God.<\/p>",
