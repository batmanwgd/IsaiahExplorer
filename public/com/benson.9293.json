Bishop Lowth renders the clause, <i>As the mother birds hovering over their young; so shall Jehovah, God of hosts, protect Jerusalem <\/i>\u2014With such care and compassion, such swiftness and resolution. <i>Defending also he will deliver it <\/i>\u2014That is, he will so defend it as to secure the continuance of its safety, and not suffer it to fall into the enemy\u2019s hand. <i>And passing over he will preserve it <\/i>\u2014The word <span class=\"hebrew_text\">,\u05e4\u05e1\u05d5\u05d7 <\/span>,, here rendered <i>passing over, <\/i>,is the word constantly used of the destroying angel\u2019s passing over the houses of the Israelites, when he slew all the firstborn of the Egyptians, (Exodus 12.,) to which history the prophet seems here to refer. The destroying angel was to pass over Jerusalem, and leave it untouched, although it deserved to be destroyed, and was only to smite the Assyrian army. The besiegers were to be slain by the pestilence, but none of the besieged were to take the infection. <\/p>,",
