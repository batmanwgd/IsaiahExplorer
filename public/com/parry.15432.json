Symbolically, it suggests that the humble will be exalted and the proud brought low (see also <a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 49:23; 109:74<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\"> 133:22<\/a>). <\/p> <p> <i>crooked shall be made straight, and the rough places plain.<\/i> These statements are similar in meaning to \"make straight in the desert a highway\" (40:3). <i>Crooked<\/i> also means \"deceitful\" or \"sly,\" so the phrase could read, the \"deceitful shall be made upright.\"<\/p> ",
