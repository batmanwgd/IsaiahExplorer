    "html": "<p>We have called this piece &ldquo;A Hymn of Forgiveness,&rdquo; although it actually consists in a saying of Yahweh followed by a hymnic invocation to praise. It follows, as we have noticed, on the summary found in vss. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODU0MF0seyIxNzgwOSI6MjJ9XQ==\">6&ndash;8<\/a>. It resumes again the themes previously used: the titles of Jacob\/Israel and servant, creator and avenger of Israel, and the affirmation of forgiveness (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NTMxXQ==\">43:25<\/a>). The comparison of sin with clouds and mist is Palestinian; in the dry months of the year there is heavy mist almost every morning, which disappears very rapidly after the sun rises. It is unusual in the OT for sin to be treated as something so transitory and insubstantial; it is Yahweh&rsquo;s forgiving power which removes man&rsquo;s heaviest burden. Hosea used the same comparison to show how frail Israel&rsquo;s devotion was (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3Nzc0XQ==\">6:4<\/a>). The apostrophe to nature with which the passage concludes is paralleled in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODQ5MV0seyIxNzkwMiI6Nn1d\">42:10&ndash;12<\/a> (see Comment <em>ad loc.<\/em> [Sec. 10]) and elsewhere.<\/p><p>McKenzie, J. L. (2008). <em>Second Isaiah: Introduction, Translation, and Notes<\/em> (Vol. 20, p. 71). New Haven; London: Yale University Press.<\/p>",
