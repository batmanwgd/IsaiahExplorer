Judah is sometimes called Israel; see <a class=\"ref\">Ezekiel 13:16; Malachi 1:1; Malachi 2:11<\/a>;: but the name of Jacob and of Israel, used apparently with design in this place, each of which names includes the twelve tribes, and the other circumstances mentioned in this and the next verse, which did not in any complete sense accompany the return from the captivity of Babylon, seem to intimate that this whole prophecy extends its views beyond that event. <\/p> ",
