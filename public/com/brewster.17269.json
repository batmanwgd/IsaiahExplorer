    "html": "<p><b>(<a class=\"ref\">3 Nephi 22:17<\/a>).<\/b>\"<i>No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper.<\/i>\" As persecution against the Lord's people and His Church continues to increase in the last days, the promise of the Lord remains sure. No matter what the weapon slander or violence it will fail. Within a short time after the restoration of the priesthood and the establishment of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, a revelation was received in response to the publication of newspaper articles critical of the Church. The Prophet Joseph Smith was admonished to \"confound your enemies. \u2026 [L]et them bring forth their strong reasons against the Lord.\" Then came this promise:<\/p>     <p>\"Verily, thus saith the Lord unto you there is no weapon that is formed against you shall prosper;<\/p>     <p>\"And if any man lift his voice against you he shall be confounded <i>in mine own due time.<\/i>\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 71:7-10<\/a>; italics added.)<\/p>     <p>Thus, while it may appear that the efforts of some enemies of the Lord are having some success, they are ultimately doomed to fail \"in [His] own due time.\" (Also see the commentary on 54:15 and 54:16.)<\/p>     <p>Perhaps these bold words of the Lord's prophet of the Restoration, even Joseph Smith, would serve as an appropriate conclusion to the commentary on this chapter:<\/p>     <p>\"No unhallowed hand can stop the work from progressing; persecutions may rage, mobs may combine, armies may assemble, calumny may defame, but the truth of God will go forth boldly, nobly, and independent, till it has penetrated every clime, swept every country, and sounded in every ear, till the purposes of God shall be accomplished, and the Great Jehovah shall say the work is done.\" (HC 4:540.)<\/p>",
