It refers to those who are inflated with a false opinion of their own knowledge, and who are, therefore, self-confident and vain. This is expressly forbidden; <a class=\"ref\">Proverbs 3:7<\/a> : &lsquo;Be not wise in thine own eyes;&rsquo; compare <a class=\"ref\">Proverbs 26:12<\/a>.<\/p><p><em>In their own eyes<\/em>&mdash;In their own opinion, or estimation.<\/p><p><em>And prudent<\/em>&mdash;Knowing; self-conceited.

The evil of this was,<\/p><p>(1) That it evinced and fostered &ldquo;pride.&rdquo;<\/p><p>(2) That it rendered them unwilling to be instructed, and especially by the prophets.<\/p><p>As they supposed that they were already wise enough, they refused to listen to others. This is always the effect of such self-confidence: and hence, the Saviour required his disciples to be meek, and humble, and teachable as children.<\/p>",
