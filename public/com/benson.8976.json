Of what particular kind the trees here mentioned were, cannot be determined with certainty. The Hebrew word  <span class=\"hebrew_text\">\u05d0\u05dc\u05d4<\/span>, here used, is rendered <i>ilex <\/i>by Bishop Lowth, which properly means <i>the scarlet oak. <\/i>Others think the terebinth-tree was intended. <i>And ye shall be confounded for the gardens, <\/i>&c. \u2014 In which, as well as in the groves, they practised idolatry: see <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 65:3<\/a>; and <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 66:17<\/a>. \u201cSacred groves,\u201d the reader will observe, \u201cwere a very ancient and favourite appendage of idolatry. They were furnished with the temple of the god to whom they were dedicated; with altars, images, and every thing necessary for performing the various rites of worship offered there; and were the scenes of many impure ceremonies, and of much abominable superstition. They made a principal part of the religion of the old inhabitants of Canaan; and the Israelites were commanded to destroy their groves, among other monuments of their false worship. The Israelites themselves, however, became afterward very much addicted to this species of idolatry:\u201d see <a class=\"ref\">Ezekiel 20:28; Hosea 4:13<\/a>. Bishop Lowth.<\/p>",
