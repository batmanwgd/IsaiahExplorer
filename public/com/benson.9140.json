    "html": " <p> <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3OTc1XQ==\">Isaiah 16:5 <\/a>. <i>And in mercy \u2014 <\/i> By my mercy. I am now punishing their sins, yet I will deliver them for my own mercy\u2019s sake. <i>The throne shall be established \u2014 <\/i> The kingdom of Judah. <i>He \u2014 <\/i> Their king; <i>shall sit upon it in truth \u2014 <\/i> That is, firmly and constantly; for truth is often put for the stability and certainty of a thing, as <a class=\"ref\">2 Chronicles 32:1; Proverbs 11:18 <\/a>. <i>In <\/i> <i>the tabernacle of David \u2014 <\/i> In the house, or palace, which is called <i>a tent, <\/i> or <i>tabernacle, <\/i> with respect to the unsettledness of David\u2019s house, which now indeed was more like a tabernacle than a strong palace. <i>Seeking judgment \u2014 <\/i> Searching out the truth of things with care and diligence; <i>and hasting righteousness \u2014 <\/i> Neither denying nor yet delaying justice. Interpreters vary greatly concerning the application of this passage. Some refer it entirely to Hezekiah, a pious and just king, whose throne, after the chastisement of Sennacherib in Judea, was established in glory; others refer it immediately to the Messiah; and others again to both: to Hezekiah as the type, and to the Messiah, in a more sublime sense, as the antitype; and this seems to be nearly the opinion of Vitringa, who thinks that while the prophet was speaking of the advantages of the kingdom of Hezekiah, he was carried forward to a contemplation of the kingdom of Christ, and made use of such phrases as, in their full extent, can only be applied to that kingdom. <\/p> ",
