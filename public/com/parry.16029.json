Here he tells us that the new heavens and new earth will endure forever, as will the seed and name of the righteous (66:22).<\/p> <p>In that millennial earth, all people will know the Lord and faithfully worship him (66:23). But they will have a reminder of the fate of the wicked, for they will see the carcasses of those who transgressed against God, which will be disgusting to all who remain (66:24). Further, the righteous will know that though the bodies of the wicked will eventually rot away and disappear, their spiritual punishment will continue forever (66:24).<\/p> <blockquote>For as the <i>new heavens and the new earth,<\/i> which I will make, <u>shall remain<\/u> before me, saith the Lord, so shall <i>your seed and your name<\/i> <u>remain<\/u>. (66:22)     <br>And it shall come to pass, that from <i>one new moon to another,<\/i>     <br>and from <i>one sabbath to another,<\/i>     <br>shall all flesh come to worship before me, saith the Lord. (66:23)     <br>And they shall go forth, and look upon the carcases of the men that have transgressed against me:     <br>for <i>their worm<\/i> shall <u>not die<\/u>,     <br><u>neither<\/u> shall <i>their fire<\/i> <u>be quenched<\/u>;     <br>and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh.
