The general treatment extends from chapters 24 to 27. In chapters 13\u201323 the nations could be thought of as the main actors with the Lord in the position of reacting to them. Thus, one could get the idea that the nations are somehow originators of the events of history. Chapters 24\u201327 correct that impression. God is the sovereign actor on the stage of history. All things come from him, and all things must eventually return to him. He created time, and he will bring it to an end.<\/p>     <p>\u2003Because these chapters focus especially on the end of time, they are sometimes referred to as \u201cIsaiah\u2019s Apocalypse.\u201d However, a comparison with Daniel, the intertestamental Jewish apocalypses, and the book of Revelation demonstrates that this material is not really in the genre of apocalypse. It lacks the fantastic imagery, color, and numerology that tend to characterize that genre. At the most it might be called preapocalyptic. It is certainly eschatological, in that it deals with the last things, but it lacks the kind of mysterious imagery that needs a special revelation in order to understand its significance.<\/p>     <p>\u2003There are two recurrences that run throughout the four chapters. There is also a measure of contrast in the recurrences. (1) The first is of songs and singing. The contrast is between the silenced songs of the ruthless (24:8\u20139; 25:5) and the jubilant songs of the redeemed (24:14, 16; 26:1, 19; 27:2). (2) The other is of city, with a contrast between the city of the ruthless (24:10, 12; 25:2\u20133, 12; 27:10), which is destroyed, and the city of God (26:1, also referred to as \u201cthis mountain,\u201d 25:6, 7, 10; 27:13), which is redeemed and secure. The line of thought in the chapters moves from the destruction of the \u201cearth\u201d (ch. 24) to the promise of restoration for God\u2019s people (ch. 27). Between these two poles is the dramatic assertion that God\u2019s deliverance is not only for his own people but for all nations who will turn to him (ch. 25). Chapter 26 is both an assertion of trust in God and a prayer for him to deliver a people helpless to deliver itself.<\/p>     <p>\u2003Like chapter 6, chapter 24 can be understood either as part of what precedes it or of what follows it. In that sense, it is an excellent transitional piece. This chapter does give a general summary to what was said in particular detail in chapters 13\u201323: The entire earth is under God\u2019s judgment. The fact that chapters 13\u201314 open the section with something of a worldwide focus lends further support to that idea. Indeed, if chapters 25\u201327 did not follow chapter 24, there would be no question that it was intended to be read as a conclusion to chapters 13\u201323. However, those chapters do follow, and that makes it more difficult to include chapter 24 in a unit with the preceding chapters. As already noted, the recurrence of \u201ccity\u201d and \u201csong\u201d unites it to chapters 25\u201327, as does the central focus on the Lord\u2019s activity. Thus, it seems best to read chapter 24 with chapters 25\u201327 but to recognize that the entire block of material has been inserted here in order to put chapters 13\u201323 into a worldwide context.<\/p>     ",
