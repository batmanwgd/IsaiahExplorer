These nail marks are a sign to Israel\u2014and to the world\u2014that Christ has indeed fulfilled his mission as Savior (22:23, 25; <a class=\"ref\">John 20:25; 3 Ne. 11:14-15<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 6:37; 45:48<\/a>). Marks in the palm of the hand are also a constant reminder to the Savior, who bears those marks and is always mindful of us.<\/p> <p><i>walls\/before me.<\/i> The walls of Jerusalem are ever present in the consciousness of those who dwell in the city. In the same way, an awareness of Israel is ever present with the Lord (60:18).<\/p> ",
