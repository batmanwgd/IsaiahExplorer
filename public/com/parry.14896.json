The murder of children and the ravishing of wives is not new to history but represents here both an increase of the hideous crimes against nature and man's savage inclination. Meanwhile, righteous men, with their wives and children gathered around them, will reside in \"a land of peace, a city of refuge, a place of safety for the saints of the Most High God&hellip;. And it shall come to pass among the wicked, that every man that will not take his sword against his neighbor must needs flee unto Zion for safety&hellip;and it shall be the only people that shall not be at war one with another\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 45:66-69<\/a>). <\/p> ",
