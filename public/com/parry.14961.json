Kir-hareseth's economy was founded on its wine industry. Verses 7-10 contain references to this famous industry that existed in ancient Moab. They include <i>fields of Heshbon, vine of Sibmah, principal plants, branches, vine of Sibmah, summer fruits, harvest, plentiful field, vineyards, wine,<\/i> and <i>vintage.<\/i> Moab's inhabitants will mourn because its economic mainstay, in which it placed so much trust, will be lost.<\/p> <p>Some translators read \"raisin cakes of Kir-hareseth\"<i> <\/i>rather than \"foundations of Kir<i>-<\/i>hareseth<i>.<\/i>\"<i> <\/i>Such a reading fits well into the context of this section of Isaiah, for raisin cakes, used in apostate religious practices (<a class=\"ref\">Hosea 3:1<\/a>), were made of dried and compressed grapes (<a class=\"ref\">2 Sam. 6:19; 1 Chr. 16:3<\/a>). <\/p> ",
