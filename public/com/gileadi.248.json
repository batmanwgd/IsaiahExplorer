    "html": "<p>The presence of Jehovah&rsquo;s servant among Egypt&rsquo;s covenanters has the effect of intensifying their devotions to the point that Jehovah personally manifests himself to them. Because the verb to &ldquo;know&rdquo; signifies a consummated covenant relationship, the Egyptians&rsquo; worship of Jehovah results in their literally coming to know him, not just know<em>about<\/em> him. Underscoring their experience with Israel&rsquo;s God is their worship by &ldquo;sacrifice and offerings&rdquo; and &ldquo;making vows&rdquo; and &ldquo;fulfilling them&rdquo; (cf.<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg3NjAiOjJ9LFsxODgyOV0seyIxODk0MyI6Mn1d\">Isaiah 56:6-7; 60:7; 66:20-21<\/a>), inferring that others who have made such vows or covenants aren&rsquo;t fulfilling them.<\/p> ",
