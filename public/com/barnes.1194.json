    "html": "<p><em>The earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof<\/em>&mdash;The statements in this verse are given as a reason why the curse had been pronounced against them, and why these calamities had come upon them, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTAyXQ==\">Isaiah 24:6<\/a>. The first reason is, that the very earth become polluted by their crimes. This phrase may denote that injustice and cruelty prevailed to such an extent that the very earth was stained with gore, and covered with blood under the guilty population. So the phrase is used in <a class=\"ref\">Numbers 33:33; Psalm 106:38<\/a>. Or it may mean in general that the wickedness of the people was great, and was accumulating, and the very earth under them was polluted by sustaining such a population. But the former is probably the correct interpretation.<\/p><p><em>Changed the ordinance<\/em>&mdash;Or, the statute (\u05d7\u05e7 cho\u0302q). This word, from \u05d7\u05e7\u05e7 cha\u0302qaq, to engrave, and then to make or institute a law or an ordinance, is usually applied to the positive statutes appointed by Moses. The word statute accurately expresses the idea. These they had changed by introducing new statutes, and had in fact, if not in form, repealed the laws of Moses, and introduced others.<\/p><p><em>Broken the everlasting covenant<\/em>&mdash;The word &lsquo;covenant&rsquo; here is evidently used, as it is often, in the sense of law. By the term &lsquo;everlasting covenant,&rsquo; Vitringa correctly supposes is denoted the laws of nature, the immutable laws of justice and right, which are engraven on the conscience, and which are inflexible and perpetual.<\/p> ",
