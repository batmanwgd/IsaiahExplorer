That is stated more fully than in the preceding verse, because while he shews that the Church will not be exempt from calamities and afflictions, but must maintain a constant warfare, he encourages to patience and courage; as if he had said, \u201cThe Lord hath not redeemed thee that thou mightest enjoy pleasures and luxuries, or that thou mightest abandon thyself to ease and indolence, but rather that thou shouldest be prepared for enduring every kind of evils.\u201d <\/p> \n <p>By <i>fire <\/i> and <i>water <\/i> he means every kind of miseries to which we are liable in this life; for we must contend not with calamities of one kind only, but with infinitely diversified calamities. At one time we must \u201cpass through wares\u201d and at another \u201cthrough fire.\u201d (<a class=\"ref\">Psalms 66:12<\/a>.) In like manner the Apostle James exhorts believers not to faint when they \u201cfall into various temptations.\u201d (<a class=\"ref\">James 1:2<\/a>.) And, indeed, faith needs to be put to the trial in many ways; for it often happens that he who has been victorious in one combat has been baffled by another kind of temptation. We are therefore tried by afflictions, but are at length delivered; we are baffled by the billows, but are not swallowed up; we are even scorched by the flames, but are not consumed. We have, indeed, the same feeling of pain as other men, but we are supported by the grace of God, and fortified by the spirit of patience, that we may not faint; and at length he will stretch out his hand and lift us up on high. <\/p> ",
