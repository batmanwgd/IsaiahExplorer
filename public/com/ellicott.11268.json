With the passionate joy in light which sees in it, in proportion to its intensity, the symbol of the Divine glory, Isaiah beholds a world in which sun and moon shall shine with a brightness that would now be intolerable, but which shall then be an element of delight. <\/p> \n <p>In the day that the Lord bindeth up.\u2014The day of blessing follows on the day of judgment. Even that had, for God\u2019s true servants, been the beginning of blessings, but this was but the earnest of a more glorious future. Isaiah reasons as St. Paul does. If one is the \u201creconciling of the world,\u201d what shall the other be but \u201clife from the dead \u201c? (<a class=\"ref\">Romans 11:15<\/a>). (Comp. also <a class=\"ref\">Deuteronomy 32:39<\/a>.) <\/p> ",
