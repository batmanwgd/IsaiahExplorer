Gesenius supposes that this is the arrow-snake, so called from its darting or springing, in the manner of the rattle-snake&mdash;from an obsolete root to draw oneself together, to contract. Bochart (Hieroz. ii. 3. 11. 408-419) has examined the meaning of the word at length, and comes to the conclusion that it means the serpent which the Greeks called acontias, and the Latins, jaculus&mdash;the arrow-snake. The serpent is oviparous, and nourishes its young. The ancient versions, however, understand it in the same sense as the \u05e7\u05e4\u05d3 qippo\u0302d in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 34:11<\/a> &mdash;the hedgehog or porcupine.<\/p><p><em>Under her shadow<\/em>&mdash;This might be done by the serpent that should coil up and cherish her young.<\/p><p><em>The vultures...<\/em>&mdash;The black vulture, according to Bochart; according to Gesenius, the kite, or falcon so called from its swift flight. Either of them will suit the connection.<\/p><p><em>Also be gathered, every one with her mate<\/em>&mdash;They shall make their nests there; that is, this shall be their secure, undisturbed retreat.<\/p>",
