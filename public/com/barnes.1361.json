    "html": "<p><em>But the liberal<\/em> &mdash;This seems also to have the force of a proverbial expression. The word &lsquo;liberal&rsquo; means generous, noble, large-hearted, benevolent; a man of large views and of public spirit; a man above covetousness, avarice, and self-seeking; a man who is willing to devote himself to the welfare of his country, and to the interests of his fellow-men. It is implied here that such persons would be selected to administer the affairs of the government I under the wise and virtuous prince of whom the prophet speaks.<\/p><p><em>Deviseth liberal things<\/em> &mdash;He purposes those things which will tend to promote the public welfare, and not those merely which will conduce to his private ends and gratification.<\/p><p><em>And by liberal things shall he stand<\/em> &mdash;Margin, &lsquo;Be established.&rsquo; That is, according to the connection, he shall be confirmed, or approved in the government of the virtuous king referred to. It is, however, a proposition in a general form, and means also that a man by a liberal course shall be established; that is, his character, reputation, hopes, shall be established by it. This is true now. If a man wishes to obtain permanent peace and honor, the esteem of his fellow-men, or the evidence of divine approbation, it can be best done by large and liberal schemes to advance the happiness of a dying world. He who is avaricious and narrow-minded has no happiness, and no durable reputation; he who is large-hearted and benevolent, has the approbation of the wise and good, the favor of God, and a firm and unshaken support in the trials of life, and in the agonies of death.<\/p> ",
