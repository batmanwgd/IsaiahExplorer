    "html": "<p>Jehovah&rsquo;s knowing where the king of Assyria dwells, and his comings and goings, alludes to king&rsquo;s spiritual condition as much as to his physical presence. A state of being &ldquo;stirred up [in anger]&rdquo; against Israel&rsquo;s God, for example, is typical of Perdition or antichrist types (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 51:13<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\">Daniel 7:23-26; 2 Thessalonians 2:3-9; Revelation 13:3-8<\/a>). The archtyrant&rsquo;s comparison to a wild bull or animal whose nose snorts and whose mouth bellows marks him as less than human. In Isaiah&rsquo;s theology, he is an example of de-creation, in which people who descend spiritually become less than they once were.<\/p>",
