The principal enemies of the Jews, who had oppressed them, were slain when Babylon was taken by Cyrus (see the notes at <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzkwOCI6MjJ9\">Isaiah 13<\/a> ; 14)<\/p><p><em>They shall not live<\/em>&mdash;They shall not again live, and be permitted to harass and enslave us.<\/p><p><em>They are deceased<\/em>&mdash;Hebrew, \u05e8\u05e4\u05d0\u05d9\u05dd repa\u0302&lsquo;iym&mdash;a name given to the shades or manes of the dead, from an idea that they were weak and powerless (see the notes at <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzkzOCI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 14:9-10<\/a> ; compare <a class=\"ref\">Psalm 88:11; Proverbs 2:18; Proverbs 9:18; Proverbs 21:16<\/a>).
