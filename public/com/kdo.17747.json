    "html": "<p> Jehovah acknowledges Him, and consecrates and equips Him for His great work with the seven spirits.<em> \u201dAnd the Spirit of Jehovah descends upon Him, spirit of wisdom and understanding, spirit of counsel and might, spirit of knowledge and fear of Jehovah.\u201d<\/em> \u201cThe Spirit of Jehovah\u201d (<em> ruach Yehovah <\/em> ) is the Divine Spirit, as the communicative vehicle of the whole creative fulness of divine powers. Then follow the six spirits, comprehended by the <em> ruach Yehovah <\/em> in three pairs, of which the first relates to the intellectual life, the second to the practical life, and the third to the direct relation to God. For <em> c hocma\u0302h <\/em> (wisdom) is the power of discerning the nature of things through the appearance, and <em> b\u0131\u0304na\u0302h <\/em> (understanding) the power of discerning the differences of things in their appearance; the former is \u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u03b9\u0301\u03b1 , the latter \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u0301\u03ba\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 or \u03c3\u03c5\u0301\u03bd\u03b5\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 . \u201cCounsel\u201d (<em> etza\u0302h <\/em> ) is the gift of forming right conclusions, and \u201cmight\u201d (<em> gebu\u0304ra\u0302h <\/em> ) the ability to carry them out with energy. \u201cThe knowledge of Jehovah\u201d (<em> da\u201bath Yehovah <\/em> ) is knowledge founded upon the fellowship of love; and \u201cthe fear of Jehovah\u201d (<em> yir'ath Yehova\u0302h <\/em> ), fear absorbed in reverence. There are seven spirits, which are enumerated in order from the highest downwards; since the spirit of the fear of Jehovah is the basis of the whole (<a class=\"ref\">Proverbs 1:7; Job 28:28; Psalms 111:10<\/a>), and the Spirit of Jehovah is the heart of all. It corresponds to the shaft of the seven-lighted candlestick, and the three pair of arms that proceeded from it. In these seven forms the Holy Spirit descended upon the second David for a permanent possession, as is affirmed in the <em> perf. consec<\/em> . \u05d5\u05e0\u05d4\u05d4 (with the tone upon the ultimate, on account of the following guttural, to prevent its being pronounced unintelligibly;<\/p><p> (Note: This moving forward of the tone to the last syllable is also found before <em> Ayin<\/em> in <a class=\"ref\">Genesis 26:10<\/a>, and very commonly with <em> ku\u0304ma\u0302h <\/em> , and verbs of a similar kind; also before Elohim and Jehovah, to be read <em> Adonai<\/em> , and before the half-guttural <em> resh<\/em> , <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 43:1; Psalms 119:154<\/a>, but nowhere on any other ground than the orthophonic rather than euphonic one mentioned above; compare also \u05d5\u05e1\u05e8\u05d4 in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODk4XQ==\">Isaiah 11:13<\/a>, with \u05d5\u05e1\u05e8\u05d5\u05bc (with \u05d4 following) in <a class=\"ref\">Exodus 8:7<\/a>.)<\/p><p><em> nuach <\/em> like \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03b2\u03b1\u03b9\u0301\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9\u0300 \u03bc\u03b5\u0301\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd , <a class=\"ref\">John 1:32-33<\/a>).
