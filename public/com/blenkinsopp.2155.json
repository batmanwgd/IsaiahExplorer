    "html": " <p>The abrupt transition between <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODc1NSI6MTJ9\">56:1&ndash;8 and 56:9&ndash;12<\/a>, led the Targumist to introduce a linking verse with a catchword hooking the two together: &ldquo;All the kings of the peoples who gather together (<em>kn\u015b<\/em>, cf. <em>qb\u1e63<\/em>, three times in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzYyXQ==\">v 8<\/a>) to oppress you, Jerusalem &hellip; will be food for the wild animals.&rdquo; The link had the further advantage of redirecting the opprobrious language in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODc2MyI6NH0=\">vv 9&ndash;12<\/a>, to Gentiles who have &ldquo;wandered off, each on his own way, to prey on Israel&rsquo;s wealth&rdquo; (<em>mmvnyh dy\u015br\u02bel <\/em>). Ibn Ezra is more to the point: &ldquo;The idea connecting the following with the preceding verses is that the righteous Israelites and the proselytes will return, but those who persevere in the worship of idols will not.&rdquo; Setting aside the question whether Ibn Ezra has correctly identified the situation envisaged here, the common rhetorical device of alternating positive words of assurance and promise with denunciation and threat appears to be a feature of these chapters, as a reading of the following in sequence demonstrates: <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg3NTUiOjh9LHsiMTg3NjMiOjR9LHsiMTg3NjciOjJ9LHsiMTg3NjkiOjExfSx7IjE4NzgwIjo4fSx7IjE4Nzg4IjoxNH1d\">56:1&ndash;8; 56:9&ndash;12; 57:1&ndash;2; 57:3&ndash;13; 57:14&ndash;21; and 58:1&ndash;14<\/a>. <\/p> <p>Verbal markers of a kind that make it relatively easy to identify sayings in early prophetic texts are not abundant in these chapters, and their appearance in the initial or final position in sayings is mostly limited to the beginning and end of <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">56&ndash;66<\/a>. The following prophetic <em>incipits<\/em>, and <em>excipits<\/em>, of sayings appear in these chapters: <\/p> <table style=\"height: 192px;\"> <tbody> <tr style=\"height: 48px;\"> <td style=\"height: 48px;\"> <p> <em>koh \u02be\u0101mar YHVH <\/em> <\/p> <\/td> <td style=\"height: 48px;\"> <p> <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzU1LDE4OTA2LDE4OTExLDE4OTI0LDE4OTM1XQ==\">56:1; 65:8, 13; 66:1, 12<\/a> <\/p> <\/td> <\/tr> <tr style=\"height: 48px;\"> <td style=\"height: 48px;\"> <p> <em>\u02be\u0101mar YHVH <\/em> <\/p> <\/td> <td style=\"height: 48px;\"> <p> <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzgwLDE4OTIyLDE4OTMyLDE4OTQ0LDE4OTQ2XQ==\">57:14?; 65:24; 66:9, 21, 23<\/a> <\/p> <\/td> <\/tr> <tr style=\"height: 48px;\"> <td style=\"height: 48px;\"> <p> <em>n\u0115\u02beum YHVH <\/em> <\/p> <\/td> <td style=\"height: 48px;\"> <p> <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzYyLDE4ODIxLDE4OTQwXQ==\">56:8; 59:20; 66:17<\/a> <\/p> <\/td> <\/tr> <tr style=\"height: 48px;\"> <td style=\"height: 48px;\"> <p> <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzY1NiI6MzF9\"> <em>others <\/em><\/a> <\/p> <\/td> <td style=\"height: 48px;\"> <p> <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODAxLDE4OTI4XQ==\">58:14; 66:5<\/a> <\/p> <\/td> <\/tr> <\/tbody> <\/table> <p>The distribution appears to confirm the opinion stated earlier and shared by many commentators (e.g., Westermann 1969, 305&ndash;6) that <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODc1NSI6OH0=\">56:1&ndash;8<\/a>, and much if not all of the final chapter were added as bookends to the rest of the material. <\/p> <p> <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODc2MyI6NH0=\">Isaiah 56:9&ndash;12<\/a>, is not set off with an incipit and excipit, which has made it easier to read it as part of a larger unit. This larger unit would include <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODc1NSI6OH0=\">56:1&ndash;8<\/a>, preceding it, according to Beuken (1986a); and following it, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODc2NyI6MjF9\">57:1&ndash;21<\/a>, according to Steck (1991a), or <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODc2NyI6MTN9\">57:1&ndash;13<\/a>, according to Beuken (1986a; 1989a, 45&ndash;48), or at least <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODc2NyI6Mn0=\">57:1&ndash;2<\/a>, according to Bonnard (1972, 353) and Hanson (1975, 186). For Muilenburg (1956, 660), <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODc2MyI6NH0=\">56:9&ndash;12<\/a>, constitutes the first two strophes of a nine-strophe poem that ends at <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4Nzc5XQ==\">57:13<\/a>. However, the subject matter and tone of <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODc2MyI6NH0=\">56:9&ndash;12<\/a>, set it apart rather decisively from both <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg3NTUiOjh9LHsiMTg3NjciOjJ9XQ==\">56:1&ndash;8 and 57:1&ndash;2<\/a>. It is also self-enclosed, beginning with an invitation to eat and ending with an invitation to drink, using the same rare aramaicizing form <em>\u02be\u0113t\u0101y&ucirc;<\/em>, &ldquo;come.&rdquo; It will still be important to determine the function of this brief diatribe within the larger unit of <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODc1NSI6MTkzfQ==\">chs. 56&ndash;66<\/a>, but we should first acknowledge its distinctive character. <\/p> <p>The proposal of Volz (1932, 208), taken up by Westermann (1969, 317), that <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODc2MyI6NH0=\">56:9&ndash;12<\/a>, is preexilic, depends on the unsustainable argument that only under the monarchy was Israel threatened by invasion and devastation by foreign nations, an argument that a cursory reading of Ezra-Nehemiah will suffice to dispel. If, moreover, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODc2MyI6NH0=\">56:9&ndash;12<\/a>, is dependent on <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Jer 12:9&ndash;10<\/a>, as I will argue, a preexilic date would be ruled out. Precision is out of the question, but the situation as described would be consistent with a date in the early part of the reign of Darius I, that is, shortly before or after 520 b.c.e. This time frame would be consistent with the description of hazardous social and political conditions in <a class=\"ref\">Zech 7&ndash;8 and Ezra 1&ndash;6<\/a>, referring to that period. <\/p> <p>The denunciation exploits the familiar biblical metaphor of a flock of sheep or goats vulnerable to attack by wild animals and therefore in need of protection by shepherds assisted by guard dogs (e.g., <a class=\"ref\">Ezek 34:1&ndash;10<\/a>). The invitation to the wild animals (external enemies) to come and make a meal of the flock (a Jewish community) points to dereliction of duty on the part of those whose task it was to guard the flock. Pace Hanson (1975, 196), there is no indication that the watchmen are antieschatological Zadokite priests. That the civic and religious leadership is intended (McKenzie 1968, 154; Westermann 1969, 317; Whybray 1975, 200) may be accepted in a general sense. The metaphor of shepherd and shepherding had been applied to rulers for centuries in the Near East, it is so used in biblical texts from the later period (e.g., <a class=\"ref\">Jer 12:10; Ezek 34:1&ndash;10<\/a>), and this may have been the idea behind the gloss in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzY1XQ==\">v 11<\/a>,(<em>v\u0115h\u0113mm\u0101h r\u014d\u02bf&icirc;m <\/em>), which identifies the nonbarking dogs as &ldquo;shepherds&rdquo; in this sense. <\/p> <p>It is possible in this instance, however, to be more precise. The term &ldquo;watchman&rdquo; or &ldquo;sentinel&rdquo; (<em>\u1e63\u014dpeh <\/em>) was by the time of writing a well-established synonym for &ldquo;prophet&rdquo; (<em>n\u0101b&icirc;\u02be <\/em>). Ezekiel was appointed as a <em>\u1e63\u014dpeh<\/em>, to warn and admonish (<a class=\"ref\">Ezek 3:16&ndash;21<\/a>), and the function of the prophet-sentinel is further described in the context of threat from war or wild animals, as here (<a class=\"ref\">Ezek 33:1&ndash;9<\/a>, cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzk0MSI6OX0=\">14:12&ndash;20<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\">Jer 6:17<\/a>). <\/p> <p>An Isaian text from the Neo-Babylonian period provides a rare insight into the soliciting of an oracle by the prophet-sentinel (here <em>m\u0115\u1e63appeh <\/em>), who is stationed on the wall to look and to listen hard, very hard. The text continues: <\/p> <blockquote> <p>Then the seer cried out, <\/p> <p>&ldquo;On the watchtower, O Lord, I stand <\/p> <p>all the day long; <\/p> <p>at my post I take my station <\/p> <p>night after night.&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3Njk0XQ==\">Isa 2:8<\/a>) <\/p> <\/blockquote> <p>The vigil is rewarded with the announcement &ldquo;Fallen, fallen, is Babylon&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODA0MiI6NH0=\">Isa 21:6&ndash;9<\/a>). The situation is no different in Habakkuk, where the prophet-sentinel takes up a position at the lookout post and waits patiently (<em>\u1e63ph<\/em>, Piel) for a revelation (<a class=\"ref\">Hab 2:1<\/a>). And not too distant in time from <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODc2MyI6NH0=\">56:9&ndash;12<\/a>, are references to sentinels on the walls of Jerusalem&mdash;whether in reality or metaphorically&mdash;whose task is the prophetic one of offering round-the-clock intercessory prayer for the city (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODg2MSI6Mn0=\">Isa 62:6&ndash;7<\/a>). The prophet, in short, served as the antenna for the community, a kind of early warning system. <\/p> <p>That it is a prophet taking prophetic colleagues to task will help to explain the acrimony of the language in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODc2MyI6NH0=\">Isa 56:9&ndash;12<\/a>. Some of the accusations are part of the stock-in-trade of verbal abuse dealt out reciprocally and freely in priestly and prophetic circles, especially lack of spiritual perception, laziness, heavy drinking, and gluttony (e.g., <a class=\"ref\">Mic 2:11; 3:5; Jer 14:18<\/a>). The only accusation lacking here is sexual transgression (as in <a class=\"ref\">Jer 23:9&ndash;15<\/a>). Comparing prophets to guard dogs was a particularly gross insult, especially dogs incapable of or unwilling to do the one thing that guard dogs are supposed to do: bark at the approach of danger. <\/p> <p>This antiprophetic diatribe agrees with what appears to have been a remarkable loss of esteem for the institution of prophecy in the early Second Temple period. A late gloss on an Isaian text (&ldquo;YHVH cut off from Israel both head and tail,&rdquo; <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODQzXQ==\">Isa 9:13<\/a>) identifies the head as the civic authorities and the tail (of the dog?) as prophets who teach lies (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODQ0XQ==\">9:14<\/a>). An especially ferocious attack links prophets with idols and unclean spirits (<a class=\"ref\">Zech 13:2&ndash;6<\/a>), and Nehemiah has some hard things to say about the political intrigues in which prophets, male and female, engaged during his governorship (<a class=\"ref\">Neh 6:7, 10&ndash;14<\/a>). <\/p> <p>If the otherwise unattested word <em>h\u014dz&icirc;m<\/em>,(<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzY0XQ==\">v 10c<\/a>) was chosen to recall <em>\u1e25\u014dz&icirc;m<\/em>, &ldquo;visionaries,&rdquo; the point would be even clearer; see the Note on this word. <\/p> <p>The indications are that, beginning in the Neo-Babylonian period, the approved kind of prophecy was becoming increasingly an activity of taking over, editing, commenting on, and updating existing prophecies. Prophecy became, in other words, more scribal and exegetical, more a matter of inspired appropriation and interpretation of existing prophetic words deemed to be still authoritative and valid than a matter of direct prophetic inspiration. The phenomenon is more clearly in evidence in the first part of the book, where we find numerous addenda, often of an eschatologizing kind. <\/p> <p>We saw an example in the previous passage: <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzYyXQ==\">56:8<\/a>, appropriates Isa 11:12 and expands its scope, but <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODk3XQ==\">11:12<\/a>, is itself an expansion on a saying about the diaspora in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzg5NSI6Mn0=\">Isa 11:10&ndash;11<\/a>. Likewise, the long anti-Moabite saying (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzk2MiI6MjB9\">Isa 15:1&ndash;16:11<\/a>) receives a later comment (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3OTgyXQ==\">Isa 16:12<\/a>), and the scope of <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3OTgyXQ==\">16:12<\/a>, is, in its turn, extended further into the future. In this last instance, the procedure is quite explicit: &ldquo;This is the saying YHVH addressed to Moab a long time ago; but now YHVH says &hellip;&rdquo;&mdash;and the updated saying in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzk4MyI6Mn0=\">16:13&ndash;14<\/a>, follows. <\/p> <p>In this third section of the book of Isaiah, the process is more difficult to detect and often obscured by the problem of establishing chronological priority. The alleged dependence of <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODc2MyI6NH0=\">56:9&ndash;12<\/a>, on Jer <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">12:7&ndash;13<\/a>, is a case in point. The Jeremiah text is a lament of YHVH in <em>oratio recta<\/em>,. YHVH has abandoned his house (household? temple?) and his inheritance (<em>na\u1e25\u0103l&acirc; <\/em>), delivered his people over to their enemies, and his land has been turned into a hyena&rsquo;s den (<a class=\"ref\">Jer 12:7&ndash;9<\/a>). The text continues: <\/p> <blockquote> <p> <sup>9b <\/sup> <em>Come, all you wild animals<\/em>, <\/p> <p> <em>come and devour! <\/em> <\/p> <p> <sup>10<\/sup>, Many <em>shepherds<\/em>, have ruined my vineyard, <\/p> <p>they have trampled down my plot of land; <\/p> <p>they have turned my fine plot of land <\/p> <p>into a desolate wilderness. <\/p> <p> <sup>11<\/sup>, They have made it a desolation, <\/p> <p>a desolation that mourns to me. <\/p> <p>The entire land is desolate, <\/p> <p> <em>but no one takes it to heart<\/em>,. <\/p> <p> <sup>12<\/sup>, On all the bare heights in the wilderness, <\/p> <p>plunderers have come; <\/p> <p>for YHVH&rsquo;s sword devours the land <\/p> <p>from one end to the other. <\/p> <p> <em>There is no peace<\/em>, for any living thing. (<a class=\"ref\">Jer 12:9b&ndash;12<\/a>) <\/p> <\/blockquote> <p>The italic phrases have clear echoes in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODc1NSI6MTc4fQ==\">Isa 56&ndash;66:9b<\/a>, in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzYzXQ==\">56:9<\/a>, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzY0XQ==\">10a<\/a>, in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzY1XQ==\">56:11b, 11b<\/a>, in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzY3XQ==\">57:1a, 12b<\/a>, in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4Nzg3XQ==\">57:21<\/a>. This is sometimes represented as a case of innerbiblical intertextuality (recently Sommer 1998, 54&ndash;56) but, assuming that <a class=\"ref\">Jer 12:7&ndash;13<\/a>, comes from Jeremiah or at least from the time of Jeremiah, it seems to be a more casual matter of picking up phrases and motifs from this and other prophetic texts rather than a deliberate taking over and rereading (<em>relecture<\/em>, <em>Fortschreibung <\/em>) of an earlier prophetic text, as we saw was the case with <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzYyXQ==\">56:8<\/a>, vis-&agrave;-vis <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODk3XQ==\">11:12<\/a>. On the other hand, we cannot exclude the possibility that the Jeremian text comes from a time when Isa <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODc1NSI6MzN9\">chs. 56&ndash;57<\/a>, were already formed more or less as we have them. <\/p> <p> <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODc2MyI6NH0=\">Isaiah 56:9&ndash;12<\/a>, ends with the <em>gaudeamus igitur<\/em>, theme common in times ancient and modern. It lacks the bitter undertones of <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MDY2XQ==\">Isa 22:13<\/a>, quoted in <a class=\"ref\">1 Cor 15:32<\/a>, and of <a class=\"ref\">Wis 2:1&ndash;9<\/a>, and while hardly a drinking song (Muilenburg 1956, 663; Bonnard 1972, 356; Whybray 1975, 201), it communicates very well the impression of thoughtless and directionless insouciance that the writer wished to convey. <\/p> <p>Blenkinsopp, J.
