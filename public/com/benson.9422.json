Imperial power is taken from thee, and translated to the Persians. <i>Thou shalt no more be called tender <\/i>\u2014 Thou shalt be reduced to the greatest hardships and miseries. <i>Take the millstones <\/i>\u2014 Thou shalt be subjected to the basest kind of slavery, which grinding at the mill was esteemed; for that work was most generally performed by slaves. The reader will observe, \u201cthey used hand-mills: water-mills were not invented till a little before the time of Augustus Cesar: wind-mills long after. It was not only the work of slaves to grind corn, but the hardest work; and often inflicted upon them as a severe punishment. And in the East it was the work of female slaves, <a class=\"ref\">Exodus 11:5; Exodus 12:29<\/a>; (in the version of the LXX.;) <a class=\"ref\">Matthew 24:41<\/a>. And it is the same to this day. \u2018Women alone,\u2019 says Shaw, p. 297, \u2018are employed to grind their corn.\u2019 \u2018They are the female slaves,\u2019 says Sir. J. Chardin, \u2018that are generally employed in the East at those hand-mills: it is extremely laborious, and esteemed the lowest employment in the house.\u2019\u201d \u2014 Bishop Lowth. <i>Uncover thy locks <\/i>\u2014 Take off the ornaments wherewith such women as were of good quality used to cover and dress their heads. These are predictions of what they should be forced to do or suffer. <i>Make bare the leg, <\/i>&c. \u2014 Gird up thy garments close and short about thee, that thou mayest be fit for travelling on foot, and for passing over those rivers through which thou wilt be constrained to wade in the way to the land of thy captivity. <\/p>\n<p><\/p>",
