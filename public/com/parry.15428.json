    "html": " <p><i>Many of us apply the words \"prepare ye the way of the Lord, make straight in the desert a highway for our God\" exclusively to John the Baptist. Yet, a revelation to Joseph Smith reveals that these words apply to all of us as full-time or member missionaries of the Church. The revelation reads, in part, \"Yea, open your mouths and they shall be filled, saying: Repent, repent, and prepare ye the way of the Lord, and make his paths straight\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 33:10<\/a>). After the word has gone forth, the Lord will come \"with a strong hand\" (40:10). Those who are righteous will receive him, and \"he shall gather the lambs with his arm, and carry them in his bosom\" (40:11).<\/i><\/p> ",
