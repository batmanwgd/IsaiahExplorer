Ii. 14); in the \u201cstones\u201d that were gathered out, the removal of the old idolatries that would have hindered the development of the nation\u2019s life; in the \u201ctower\u201d of the vineyard (comp. in a different context <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTc2NjM=\">Isaiah 1:8<\/a>), the monarchy and throne of David, or the watch-tower from which the prophets looked forth (Hab. Ii. 1; <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODA0MSI6NH0=\">Isaiah 21:5-8<\/a>); in the \u201cwinepress,\u201d the temple in which the fruits of righteousness were to issue in the wine of joy and adoration (<a class=\"ref\">Zechariah 9:17; Ephesians 5:18<\/a>). It was, we may note, one of the maxims of the Rabbis that the duty of a scribe was \u201cto set a fence around the law\u201d (Pirke Aboth, i. 1). In the last clause of the verse the pleasant song suddenly changes its tone, and the \u201cwild grapes (sour and hard, and not larger than bilberries) are types of deeds of harsh and cruel injustice on which the prophet proceeds to dwell.<\/p>",
