In <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NTA5XQ==\">Isaiah 43:3<\/a>, Egypt, Ethiopia, Seba, had been given to Cyrus, as a reward, or ransom, for the deliverance of Israel. Here the prophet goes a step farther, and contemplates them as coming, in the spirit of a voluntary surrender, as proselytes to the faith of Israel, in self-imposed bondage, offering to Israel, as one with God, the \u201csupplication\u201d which, elsewhere, is offered to Jehovah. The promise reminds us of <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 68:31; Psalms 72:10<\/a>, and yet more of <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODAyOF0seyIxNzgzNSI6M31d\">Isaiah 19:23; Isaiah 9:5-7<\/a>. A partial fulfilment may have been found in the command given by Cyrus, that these and other nations should assist in the work of rebuilding the Temple (<a class=\"ref\">Ezra 1:4<\/a>). Egypt and Ethiopia send the products of their labour. The Sab\u00e6ans (sc. the people of Meroe), strong, but not wealthy, come freely to offer their own labour. <\/p>",
