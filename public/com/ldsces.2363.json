Because they cite the prophet Isaiah&rsquo;s counsel and the prophecy to King Hezekiah, they are included here. A complete overview of the chronological events dealt with is found in Enrichment F. The notes and commentary that apply to these chapters are found in chapter 12, which covers<a class=\"ref\">2 Kings 14&ndash;20<\/a> .
