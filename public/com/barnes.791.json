    "html": "<p><em>The day...<\/em> &mdash;This expression evidently denotes that the Lord would inflict severe punishment upon every one that was lofty. Such a severe infliction is called &ldquo;the day of the Lord of hosts,&rdquo; because it would be a time when &ldquo;he&rdquo; would particularly manifest himself, and when &ldquo;he&rdquo; would be recognized as the inflicter of that punishment. &ldquo;His&rdquo; coming forth in this manner would give &ldquo;character&rdquo; to that time, and would be the prominent &ldquo;event.&rdquo; The punishment of the wicked is thus freguently called &ldquo;the day of the Lord;&rdquo;<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3OTEzXQ==\">Isaiah 13:6<\/a> ,<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3OTE2XQ==\">Isaiah 13:9<\/a> : &lsquo;Behold the day of the Lord cometh, cruel both with wrath and fierce anger,&rsquo; etc.;<a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 46:10<\/a> : &lsquo;The day of the Lord God of hosts, a day of vengeance.&rsquo;<a class=\"ref\">Ezekiel 30:3; Zephaniah 1:7, Zephaniah 1:14; Joel 2:31<\/a> ; see also in the New Testament,<a class=\"ref\">1 Thessalonians 5:2; 2 Peter 3:10<\/a> .<\/p><p><em>Every one that is proud and lofty<\/em> &mdash;Or, rather, every &ldquo;thing&rdquo; that is high and lofty. The phrase is not restricted to &ldquo;persons,&rdquo; though it embraces them. But though the language here is general, the reference is doubtless, mainly, to the princes, magistrates, and nobility of the nation; and is designed not only to designate them as men of rank and power, but as men who were haughty in their demeanour and feelings. At the same time, there is included in the language, as the subsequent verses show, all on which the nation prided itself.<\/p> ",
