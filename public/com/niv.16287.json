Where there was complete \u201cdarkness,\u201d there will now be \u201clight\u201d like that of the rising sun. There is no question as to the source of this light. It is not something that originates from within Zion; rather, it is a reflection of the \u201cglory of the L<small>ORD<\/small>.\u201d Something has occurred that makes it possible for the glory of the Lord to be seen in his people. That something is the conquest of sin by the divine warrior. As 42:6 and 49:6 said, the Servant will be a \u201clight for the Gentiles [nations],\u201d and Zion will be the lamp out of which that light shines on the nations (60:3).<\/p>     <p>\u2003The purpose of God\u2019s sharing his glory with his people becomes explicit in 60:2\u20133. Israel has a mission: The \u201cnations\u201d are in \u201cdarkness\u201d because they do not know the one Creator, who is thereby the one Savior. When the light of God dawns in Israel, the nations will recognize it for what it is and \u201ccome\u201d flowing to it. Zion\u2019s light is not for itself but for others.<\/p>     ",
