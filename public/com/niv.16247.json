Those who have depended on the Babylonian gods \u201cBel\u201d and \u201cNebo\u201d load their idol gods onto oxcarts, to be \u201ccarried\u201d off \u201cinto captivity\u201d (46:1\u20132). The worshipers, instead of being saved by their gods, have to save the gods! In an especially poignant rejoinder, God reminds his people that he is the One who has \u201ccarried\u201d (46:3) them ever since their conception in the womb, and he promises to continue to carry them through their \u201cold age\u201d (46:4). He is their Maker and will carry them.<\/p>     <p>\u2003The alternative is spelled out in 46:5\u20137. If people choose to make their own gods, they will have to carry what they have made. When they put the god down, it will not move an inch from where it is put. Would we compare the Maker and only Savior of the world to that? Surely not!<\/p>     ",
