    "html": "<p>This chapter highlights Isaiah&rsquo;s skill as a poet, demonstrates his calling as a seer, and reveals the power of his prophetic call. Isaiah describes, in detail, significant events prior to the Second Coming, identifying at least two key figures who will play essential roles <em>before <\/em>the Savior&rsquo;s return. Also, Isaiah prophesies of circumstances <em>after<\/em> the Savior&rsquo;s arrival, giving us a brief vision of what life will be like during the Millennium.<\/p>\r\n<p>When Moroni appeared to Joseph Smith on September 21, 1823, he quoted this chapter of Isaiah and explained that &ldquo;it was about to be fulfilled&rdquo; (<a class=\"ref\">Joseph Smith&mdash;History 1:40<\/a>). Through study, pondering, and prayer, we can gain an understanding into this chapter&rsquo;s importance for us as Latter-day Saints while we look for the signs of its fulfillment in these, the last days.<\/p>",
