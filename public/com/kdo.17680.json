They do not slumber (<em> nu\u0304m <\/em> ), to say nothing of sleeping (<em> ya\u0302she\u0304n <\/em> ), so great is their eagerness for battle: i.e., they do not slumber to refresh themselves, and do not even allow themselves their ordinary night's rest. No one has the girdle of his armour-shirt or coat of mail, in which he stuck his sword (<a class=\"ref\">Nehemiah 4:18<\/a>), at all loosened; nor has a single one even the shoe-string, with which his sandals were fastened, <em> broken<\/em> (<em> nittak, disrumpitur<\/em> ). The statement as to their want of rest forms a <em> climax descendens<\/em> ; the other, as to the tightness and durability of their equipment, a <em> climax ascendens<\/em> : the two statements follow one another after the nature of a <em> chiasmus<\/em> .<\/p>",
