The tread of their warhorses resembles flint; their chariot wheels revolve like a whirlwind&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzY4XQ==\">Isaiah 5:28 <\/a>). As in the allegory of the vineyard, the enemy penetrates and occupies Jehovah&rsquo;s people&rsquo;s land: &ldquo;I will have its hedge removed and let it be burned; I will have its wall broken through and let it be trampled. I will make it a desolation&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzc0NSI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 5:5-6 <\/a>). Once defenses are breached, Jehovah&rsquo;s unrepentant people seek places of resort in the woods (cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODMwXQ==\">Isaiah 8:22 <\/a>). <\/p> ",
