    "html": "<p><em>And the mean man<\/em> &mdash;That is, the man in humble life, the poor, the low in rank&mdash;for this is all that the Hebrew word here&mdash;\u05d0\u05d3\u05dd &lsquo;a\u0302da\u0302m&mdash;implies. The distinction between the two words here used&mdash;\u05d0\u05d3\u05dd &lsquo;a\u0302da\u0302m as denoting a man of humble rank, and \u05d0\u05d9\u05e9\u05c1 &lsquo;\u0131\u0302ysh as denoting one of elevated rank&mdash;is one that constantly occurs in the Scriptures. Our word &ldquo;mean&rdquo; conveys an idea of moral baseness and degradation, which is not implied in the Hebrew.<\/p><p><em>Boweth down<\/em> &mdash;That is, before idols. Some commentators, however, have understood this of bowing down in &ldquo;affliction,&rdquo; but the other is probably the true interpretation.<\/p><p><em>And the great man<\/em> &mdash;The men in elevated rank in life. The expressions together mean the same as &ldquo;all ranks of people.&rdquo; It was a common or universal thing. No rank was exempt from the prevailing idolatry.<\/p><p><em>Therefore forgive them not<\/em> &mdash;The Hebrew is &ldquo;future&rdquo;&mdash;\u05dc\u05d4\u05dd \u05d5\u05d0\u05dc\u05be\u05ea\u05e9\u05c2\u05d0 ve&lsquo;al-tis&lsquo;a\u0302&rsquo; la\u0302hem. Thou wilt not &ldquo;bear&rdquo; for them; that is, thou wilt not bear away their sins (by an atonement), or &lsquo;thou wilt not forgive them;&rsquo;&mdash;but agreeable to a common Hebrew construction, it has the force of the imperative. It involves a &ldquo;threatening&rdquo; of the prophet, in the form of an address to God &lsquo;So great is their sin, that thou, Lord, wilt not pardon them.&rsquo; The prophet then proceeds, in the following verses, to denounce the certainty and severity of the judgment that was coming upon them.<\/p> ",
