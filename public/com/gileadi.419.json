So long as the king keeps the terms of the Davidic Covenant, Jehovah will intervene to deliver his people. In other words, despite what appears, this is a chance for the king to serve as his people&rsquo;s proxy savior and for the people to be reborn on a higher spiritual level by proving loyal to their king under duress. Jehovah can cause the king of Assyria to depart and also raise up a <em>sword <\/em> or enemy against him (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MzkxXQ==\">v 38<\/a>). <\/p> ",
