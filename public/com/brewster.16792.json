He felt \"undone\" (cut off or lost) because he sensed the personal shortcomings in his less than perfect life. His self-evaluation is reminiscent of the process many go through when called to serve: \"Who am I that the Lord should give me such a special assignment?\" (See, for example, Enoch's response in <a class=\"ref\">Moses 6:31<\/a>.)<\/p>",
