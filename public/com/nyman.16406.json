The King James translators rendered the same Hebrew word in three different ways: ensign (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODk1XQ==\">Isaiah 11:10<\/a>), banner (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3OTA5XQ==\">Isaiah 13:2<\/a>), and standard (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODY1XQ==\">Isaiah 62:10<\/a>). The Book of Mormon uses the word \"banner,\" but the Joseph Smith Translation reads \"my banner,\" which clarifies that it was the Lord's banner which was to be raised. The banner or ensign being lifted up upon the high mountain may also be the establishment of the kingdom of God, as in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3Njg4XQ==\">Isaiah 2:2<\/a>. The exalted voice in 13:2 could be the \"voice of the Lord\" crying, \"Go ye out of Babylon\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 133:4-8<\/a>). \"That they may go into the gates of the noble\" is an invitation for all who will gather to Zion from the gentile countries, and for Judah to flee to Jerusalem (see <a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 133:9-13<\/a>; compare <a class=\"ref\">Rev. 18:4<\/a>).<\/p>     ",
