    "html": "<p><em>The show of their countenance<\/em>&mdash;The word rendered &ldquo;the show&rdquo; is probably derived from a word signifying &ldquo;to know,&rdquo; or &ldquo;to recognize,&rdquo; and here denotes &ldquo;impudence&rdquo; or &ldquo;pride.&rdquo; Septuagint, &lsquo;The shame of their face.&rsquo;<\/p><p><em>Doth witness against them<\/em>&mdash;&ldquo;Answers&rdquo; to them; or &ldquo;responds&rdquo; to them (\u05e2\u05e0\u05ea\u05d4 \u201ba\u0302neta\u0302h). There is a correspondence between the feeling of the heart and the looks, an &ldquo;answering&rdquo; of the countenance to the purposes of the soul that shows their true character, and betrays their plans. The prophet refers here to the great law in physiology that the emotions of the heart will be usually &ldquo;expressed&rdquo; in the countenance; and that by the marks of pride, vanity, and malice there depicted, we may judge of the heart; or as it is expressed in our translation, that the expression of the face will &ldquo;witness&rdquo; against a wicked man.<\/p><p><em>They declare...<\/em>&mdash;By their deeds. Their crimes are open and bold. There is no attempt at concealment.<\/p><p><em>As Sodom<\/em>&mdash;see <a class=\"ref\">Genesis 19:5<\/a> ; compare the note at <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NjY1XQ==\">Isaiah 1:10<\/a>.<\/p><p><em>Wo unto their soul<\/em>&mdash;They shall bring woe upon themselves; they deserve punishment. This is an expression denoting the highest abhorrence of their crimes.<\/p><p><em>They have rewarded evil...<\/em>&mdash;They have brought the punishment upon themselves by their own sins.<\/p>",
