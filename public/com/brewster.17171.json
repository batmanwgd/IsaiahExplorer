The two will \"have power to shut heaven, that it rain not in the days of their prophecy: and have power over waters to turn them to blood, and to smite the earth with all plagues, as often as they will.\" (<a class=\"ref\">Revelation 11:6<\/a>.)<\/p>     <p>\"The specified time of their ministry is 'a thousand two hundred and threescore days,' or three and one-half years. This is the same time as the Savior's mortal ministry. However, it would be wise not to be too confined in placing parameters on this period. Elder [Bruce R.] McConkie noted 'the detailed application of the 42 months to this period is yet to be revealed.'\" (BICQ, 101.) Elder McConkie also suggested that these two will be members of the Council of the Twelve or of the First Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.<\/p>     <p>At the end of their designated ministry, the two prophets will be slain. Their dead bodies will lie in the streets of Jerusalem for three and one-half days while the wicked of the world rejoice. However, their victory will be short-lived, for the two martyrs will arise as resurrected beings. A great earthquake, of a magnitude never before known, will follow and the Savior will shortly appear. The wicked will be destroyed and the earth prepared for the millennial reign. (BICQ, 100 104.)<\/p>",
