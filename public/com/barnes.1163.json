It is probable, however, that it was to Assyria. <\/p> <p> <em>With a mighty captivity <\/em>&mdash;Hebrew, \u05d2\u05d1\u05e8 geber&mdash;&lsquo;Of a man,&rsquo; or perhaps, &lsquo;O man.&rsquo; If it means &lsquo;the captivity of a man,&rsquo; the sense is, a strong, irresistible, mighty captivity where the word &ldquo;man&rdquo; is emphatic, and means such as a mighty man would make. Compare <a class=\"ref\">Job 38:3<\/a>: &lsquo;Gird up now thy loins like a man.&rsquo; The margin reads this, he &lsquo;who covered thee with an excellent covering, and clothed thee gorgeously, shall surely turn and toss thee.&rsquo; But the text conveys more nearly the idea of the Hebrew word, which denotes the action of &ldquo;casting away, or throwing&rdquo; from one as a man throws a stone. See the same use of the word \u05d8\u05d5\u05dc t\u0323u\u0302l in <a class=\"ref\">1 Samuel 18:2; 1 Samuel 20:33; Jeremiah 17:13; Jeremiah 22:26, Jeremiah 22:28; Jonah 1:5, Jonah 1:12, Jonah 1:16<\/a>. &ldquo;And will surely cover thee.&rdquo; &lsquo;Thy face,&rsquo; says Lowth, for this was the condition of mourners. The Chaldee is, &lsquo;Shall cover thee with confusion.&rsquo; So Vitringa, who supposes that it means that although Shebna was endeavoring to rear a monument that should perpetuate his name and that of his family, God would cover them with ignominy, and reduce them to their primitive, obscure, and humble condition. <\/p> ",
