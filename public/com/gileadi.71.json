Jehovah&rsquo;s cloud of glory&mdash;signifying his presence (<a class=\"ref\">Exodus 24:15-18; 33:8-11<\/a>)&mdash;makes glorious his holy people and the place where they abide. By its means, Jehovah protected ancient Israel when he appeared among his people during their wilderness travels (<a class=\"ref\">Exodus 13:20-22; 14:19-20<\/a>). Jehovah&rsquo;s &ldquo;canopy&rdquo;&mdash;as in a traditional marriage canopy&mdash;denotes his people&rsquo;s renewal of their covenant with him at that time.<\/p>",
