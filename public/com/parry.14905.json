Jehovah also used the term <i>mercy<\/i> when he brought Israel out of Egypt (<a class=\"ref\">Ex. 34:6; Deut. 4:31<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\">Ps. 78:38; Joel 2:13<\/a>). <\/p> <p><i>choose Israel.<\/i> Isaiah repeatedly declares that Jehovah has chosen the Israelites (including all who come unto Christ by covenant and obedience) to be his people (44:1-2; 49:7). Christ said to the house of Israel, \"You only have I known of all the families of the earth\" (<a class=\"ref\">Amos 3:2<\/a>). <\/p> <p><i>their own land.<\/i> Israel and America are the lands belonging to the house of Israel (14:2 below). The possession of land recalls the Abrahamic covenant.<\/p> <p> <i>foreigners shall be joined with them\/cleave to the house of Jacob.<\/i> In ancient Israel, foreigners enjoyed a special status (<a class=\"ref\">Deut. 14:21,  29<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\"> 16:11<\/a>). The verbs <i>joined<\/i> and <i>cleave,<\/i> which indicate more than a temporary, earthly union, may refer to the non-Israelites (45:14-25; 60) who, in the latter days, will flee to \"Zion for safety\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 45:68<\/a>). Elsewhere Isaiah prophesies that the foreigners and their kings will join Israel or Zion and serve her (60:1-14).<\/p> ",
