    "html": "          <p>These verses are interpreted in <a class=\"ref\">1 Ne. 22:10-12<\/a>. Nephi said these verses teach that the Lord will \"make bare his arm,\" or show his power, in the eyes of all nations in bringing his covenants and his gospel to the house of Israel. The children of Israel will be brought out of the captivity of the Gentiles and gathered to their promised lands, where they will be identified as Israelites. They will be brought out of obscurity and darkness, will be taught the truth, and will come to know the Savior. This redeeming power will not be known to men, but will be the miraculous power of God. The Book of Mormon retention \"and then, O house of Israel\" at the beginning of verse 12 shows that the gathering will begin after the Lord has fulfilled verses 10 and 11.<\/p>     <p>In describing a \"great multitude\" who would be gathered out of \"all nations\" to serve the Lord, John used the same words as those found in verse 10, but the time period of John's description seems to be the end of the world rather than the beginning of the gathering (see <a class=\"ref\">Rev. 7:16<\/a>). <\/p>     ",
