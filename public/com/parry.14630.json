Inasmuch as the wicked have chosen to worship idols that are connected to oaks and gardens (1:29), they will in a sense become what they have worshiped\u2014as valueless as an oak tree that is either dying or plagued with disease (<i>an oak whose leaf fadeth<\/i>), or as unfruitful and worthless <i>as a garden that hath no water. <\/i>The oak tree that lacks water (spiritually, Jesus represents the living waters) soon shrivels up and becomes kindling for the fire accompanying the second coming of Jesus that will burn all corruptible things. A dry garden is in a similar state.<\/p> <p><i>water.<\/i> Jesus Christ and the cleansing and purifying power of his atonement are represented by water (33:21; <a class=\"ref\">Jer. 2:13; 17:13<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\">John 4:6-14<\/a>). <\/p> ",
