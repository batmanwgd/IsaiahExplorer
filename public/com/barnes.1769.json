    "html": "<p><em>Look unto Abraham<\/em>&mdash;What was figuratively expressed in the former verse is here expressed literally. They were directed to remember that God had taken Abraham and Sarah from a distant land, and that from so humble a beginning he had increased them to a great nation. The argument is, that he was able to bless and increase the exile Jews, though comparatively feeble and few.<\/p><p><em>For I called him alone<\/em>&mdash;Hebrew, &lsquo;For one I called him;&rsquo; that is, he was alone; there was but one, and he increased to a mighty nation. So Jerome, Quia unum vocavi eum. So the Septuagint, &Omicron;\u0314\u0301&tau;&iota; &epsilon;&iota;\u0314\u0342&sigmaf; &eta;\u0313\u0342&nu; hoti heis e\u0304n&mdash;&lsquo;For he was one.&rsquo; The point of the declaration here is, that God had called one individual&mdash;Abraham&mdash;and that he had caused him to increase until a mighty nation had sprung from him, and that he had the same power to increase the little remnant that remained in Babylon until they should again become a mighty people.<\/p>",
