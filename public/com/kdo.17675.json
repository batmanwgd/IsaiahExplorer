    "html": "<p> The fifth woe: <em> \u201cWoe unto them that are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight.\u201d<\/em> The third woe had reference to the unbelieving naturalists, the opponents of prophecy (<em> nebua\u0302h <\/em> ); the fourth to the moralists, who threw all into confusion; and to this there is appended, by a very natural association of ideas, the woe denounced upon those whom want of humility rendered inaccessible to that wisdom which went hand in hand with prophecy, and the true foundation of which was the fear of Jehovah (<a class=\"ref\">Proverbs 1:7; Job 28:28; Ecclesiastes 12:13<\/a>). <em> \u201cBe not wise in thine own eyes,\u201d<\/em> is a fundamental rule of this wisdom (<a class=\"ref\">Proverbs 3:7<\/a>). It was upon this wisdom that that prophetic policy rested, whose warnings, as we read in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODE3NCI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 28:9-10<\/a>, they so scornfully rejected. The next woe, which has reference to the administration of justice in the state, shows very clearly that in this woe the prophet had more especially the want of theocratic wisdom in relation to the affairs of state in his mind.<\/p>",
