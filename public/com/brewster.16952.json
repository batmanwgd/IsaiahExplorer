Or it may be possible that the amazement (astonishment) of the people in looking at one another could be expressive of their horror in viewing the ravages of a burning disease, or the result of chemical, biological, or nuclear warfare. Conceivably, such catastrophes could not only cause a face to \"be as flames,\" but also the \"flesh [to] fall from off [the] bones, and [the] eyes from [the] sockets.\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 29:18-19<\/a>; see also BICQ, 92-93.)<\/p>",
