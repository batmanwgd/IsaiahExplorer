    "html": " <p> <i>The cities of thy holiness. <\/i> The Church again recounts her miseries, that she may move God to mercy and obtain pardon. She says that the cities have been reduced to \u201ca wilderness;\u201d and, for the sake of amplification, adds that \u201cZion is a desert;\u201d because it was the royal residence, in which God wished that men should call upon him. She adds also Jerusalem, in which Zion was; for it appeared to be shameful that a city, which God had consecrated to himself, should be ruined and destroyed by enemies. <\/p> \n <p>She calls them \u201ccities of holiness,\u201d because, as the Lord had sanctified a people, so he also wished that the cities, and even the whole country, should be consecrated to himself. Seeing, therefore, that the cities were dedicated to God, they are justly called \u201ccities of his holiness;\u201d for in them God reigned, and men called upon him. In the same manner we may at the present day give the appellation of \u201ccities of God\u2019s holiness\u201d to those which, laying aside superstitions, worship him in a sincere and right manner. <\/p> ",
