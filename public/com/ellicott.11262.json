    "html": " <p> (20) The bread of adversity.\u2014Better, bread in small quantity, and water in scant measure. The words seem to imply an allusion to the scant rations of a siege such as Jerusalem was to endure from the Assyrian armies. For this there should be the compensation that the true \u201cteachers\u201d of the people, Isaiah and his fellow-workers, should at least be recognised\u2014no longer thrust into a corner, as they had been in the days of Ahaz. The clearer vision of the truth was to be the outcome of the sharp teaching of chastisement. A various reading gives \u201cthy teacher,\u201d i.e., Jehovah Himself; but the plural seems more in harmony with the context. In the mission of <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MzU1XQ==\">Isaiah 37:2<\/a> we have a virtual fulfilment of the prediction. <\/p> ",
