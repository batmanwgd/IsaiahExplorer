Christ is the Bread of Life (<a class=\"ref\">John 6:48<\/a>) and the source of eternal life for those who inherit the celestial kingdom.<\/p> <p><i>his waters shall be sure<\/i>\u2014this phrase also reminds us of the sacrament. Christ will give the waters of eternal life to exalted souls, for he is the \"fountain of living waters\" (<a class=\"ref\">Jer. 17:13<\/a>). <\/p> <p><i>thine eyes shall see the king in his beauty<\/i>\u2014exalted souls will be privileged to behold God in all of his glory.<\/p> <p><i>they shall behold the land that is very far off<\/i>\u2014exalted souls will be privileged and blessed to see (and dwell in) God's celestial kingdom, the land that is very far off.<\/p> ",
