The same tree a man uses for fuel to keep himself warm (\"he warmeth himself, and saith, Aha, I am warm\"; 44:16) and to cook meals (\"baketh bread\"; 44:15; \"he roasteth roast\"; 44:16) is used to make an idol\u2014<i>and the residue [of the tree] he maketh a god, even his graven image.<\/i> The man takes a piece of the wood that was not used for fuel, and he takes his tools (ruler, marker, chisel, and compasses; 44:13) and carefully fashions a god. He then worships and prays to it, the work of his own hands, saying, \"Save me, you are my god\" (NIV 44:17).<\/p> ",
