    "html": "<p>As the Assyrians swept down against the alliance of Israel (Ephraim) and the Syrians, they destroyed Damascus and captured the northern region of Israel, later called the Galilee (see <a class=\"ref\">2 Kings 15:27&ndash;31<\/a>; Enrichment F). In spite of this invasion and the threat it posed for the rest of Israel and for Judah in the south, Isaiah prophesied of the coming of the Messiah as the coming of a light. The lands inherited by the tribes of Zebulun and Naphtali were in northern Israel, or the Galilee, where Jesus was raised and spent most of His ministry. The Keil and Delitzsch translation of verse 1 shows more clearly what is promised: &ldquo;&lsquo;For it does not remain dark where there is now distress: in the first time He brought into disgrace the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, and in the last He brings to honour the road by the sea, the other side of Jordan, the circle of the Gentiles&rsquo;&rdquo; (<em>Commentary,<\/em> 7:1:243).<\/p><p>They added this explanation: &ldquo;The reason assigned for the fact that the unbelieving people of Judah had fallen into a night without morning, is, that there was a morning coming, whose light, however, would not rise upon the land of Judah first, but upon other parts of the land. &hellip; The meaning is, There is not, <em>i.e.<\/em> there will not remain; a state of darkness over the land, &hellip; which is now in a state of distress; but those very districts which God has hitherto caused to suffer deep humiliation He will bring to honour by and by. &hellip; The height of the glorification would correspond to the depth of the disgrace.&rdquo; (<em>Commentary,<\/em> 7:1:243.)<\/p><p>Matthew saw the fact that the Messiah dwelt in the area of Galilee as the fulfillment of Isaiah&rsquo;s prophecy (see <a class=\"ref\">Matthew 4:12&ndash;16<\/a>).<\/p><p>The inconsistency of verse 3 is corrected when the purer Book of Mormon text is used. The word <em>not<\/em> does not appear (see <a class=\"ref\">2 Nephi 19:3<\/a>).<\/p><p class=\"cite\">LDS Church Educational System Old Testament Student Manual, 1 Kings&ndash;Malachi, Religion 302, Chapter 13, Item 52<\/p>",
