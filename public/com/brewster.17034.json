    "html": "<p><b>(<a class=\"ref\">2 Nephi 27:15-18<\/a>).<\/b>\"<i>Deliver to one that is learned.<\/i>\" This phrase deals with one of the classic stories of early Latter-day Saint history. Joseph Smith is the man to whom God delivered the plates from which the Book of Mormon was translated. (<a class=\"ref\">2 Nephi 27:15<\/a>.) The Prophet, in turn, delivered some of the words (translation) \"to another\" (Martin Harris). Martin showed the words (translation) and a copy of some of the reformed Egyptian characters (see <a class=\"ref\">Mormon 9:32<\/a>) copied from the plates to a \"learned\" professor of classic languages (Greek and Latin) at Columbia University by the name of Charles Anthon.<\/p>     <p>Upon examination, Professor Anthon declared the characters to be authentic and the translation correct. Whether or not he really had the skills to make such a scholarly assertion is irrelevant to the incident. (He most likely did not possess such skills but was seeking the praise of men.) What really matters is his utterance upon learning that he himself would not be allowed to see the original record, or plates, because \"a portion was sealed.\" Anthon then declared: \"I cannot read a sealed book,\" thus fulfilling the ancient prophecy pronounced originally by Isaiah and later recorded by Nephi. Martin Harris also visited a Dr. Samuel Mitchell, \"who sanctioned what Professor Anthon had said respecting both the characters and the translation.\" (See JS H 1:63-65.)<\/p>",
