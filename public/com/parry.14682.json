    "html": " <i>washed\/purged.<\/i> The filth of the children of Israel (including us) will be washed away by the ordinance of baptism (<a class=\"ref\">1 Ne. 20:1; Alma 7:14<\/a>) and cleansed by the blood of Jesus (<a class=\"ref\">Mal. 3:2-3; Heb. 9:22<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\">Rev. 7:14<\/a>), a process in which the Holy Ghost plays a prominent role. Joseph Smith taught that \"as the Holy Ghost falls upon one of the literal seed of Abraham, it is calm and serene; and his whole soul and body are only exercised by the pure spirit of intelligence; while the effect of the Holy Ghost upon a Gentile, is to purge out the old blood, and make him actually of the seed of Abraham\" (see also <a class=\"ref\">3 Ne. 27:20<\/a>). <\/p> <p> <i>blood\/filth.<\/i> The blood of humanity often represents iniquity (59:3; <a class=\"ref\">Micah 3:10<\/a>). Paradoxically, Jesus' blood is able to purge and cleanse our souls from iniquity because of Jesus' innocence, sinlessness, and perfection (<a class=\"ref\">Lev. 17:11; John 6:53-54<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\">Moses 6:59-60<\/a>). In its root sense, the Hebrew word for <i>filth<\/i> has reference to human excrement. The term is used symbolically to emphasize the terrible nature of the sins of Israel and the impurities found within the daughters of Zion.<\/p> <p><i>daughters of Zion.<\/i> See commentary on 3:16.<\/p> <p><i>spirit of judgment\/burning.<\/i> Together, God's judgments and his cleansing fires will purge Israel of her sins. God's fire destroys the wicked while at the same time purifying the humble and repentant.<\/p> ",
