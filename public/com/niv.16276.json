The people are like a city that has been \u201clashed by storms\u201d (54:11), subjected to \u201ctyranny\u201d and \u201cterror\u201d (54:14), and has experienced \u201chavoc\u201d (54:16) within it. But since God is the One who brought all that to pass (54:16), he is the One who can change it all (54:15, 17).<\/p>     <p>\u2003Again, the promises are lyrical in tone. In place of weathered, broken walls stained with smoke, there are \u201cbattlements of rubies\u201d glittering in the sun. In place of tyranny and terror, there is true learning, \u201cpeace\u201d (<em>salom<\/em>), \u201crighteousness,\u201d and security. These blessings are for those who gladly accept the role of \u201cservants of the L<small>ORD<\/small>.\u201d How can sinful, rebellious Israel enter into such a role? Through the ministry of the Servant of the Lord. Through his self-giving, all the promises made to his servants in chapters 40\u201348 can be realized.<\/p>     <h4>Bridging Contexts<\/h4>     <p>A<small>N OLD MAN<\/small> lies in a hospital bed. The story of his life is written in the deep furrows on his face, <em>Contexts<\/em> his heavily veined nose, and his bloodshot eyes. But deeper than those more superficial evidences lies the flat, bleak look in those eyes. He has tasted life to the full, and the taste has been bitter. Now he waits for the end, wondering if what lies beyond will be even more bitter. To the side of his bed comes a woman. Life has not been very kind to her either. Her dress is not in the latest fashion, nor is her hair dressed in a becoming way. Her complexion is sallow, and attempts to improve it with make-up have not been entirely successful. But here the similarity between the two figures ends, for out of her eyes shine eagerness, humor, hope, and love. \u201cHello, Dad,\u201d she says with a smile.<\/p>     <p>\u2003He turns his head slightly to look at her and then turns away. \u201c<small>I<\/small> know what you want to say to me, and you might as well save your breath. It\u2019s too late.\u201d Too late for forgiveness from God, too late for a new start, too late to change the past.<\/p>     <p>\u2003\u201cBut Dad, it\u2019s never too late! Look what Christ has done for me! I was in the gutter, drinking myself to death, just as you said I would. But he saw something in me to love! Everybody else said I was no good, and he told them to \u2018shut up.\u2019\u201d<\/p>     <p>\u2003\u201cDaughter, you don\u2019t know what I\u2019ve done. I was a preacher! Now I\u2019ve done things I can\u2019t even talk about. If your God is so good and loving, he wouldn\u2019t have anything to do with me. I\u2019m too far gone.\u201d<\/p>     <p>\u2003\u201cDaddy, you look at me! Nobody is too far gone for Jesus Christ! He took every sin that was ever committed or ever will be committed on this earth. If you think you\u2019re the worst sinner there ever was, you\u2019ve got another think coming. He died for Hitler! Do you think you\u2019re worse than Hitler? No, you\u2019re just like Hitler, too proud to get down on your face and ask God to forgive you. He will forgive you, Daddy! He will! Just tell him you\u2019re sorry and ask him!\u201d<\/p>     <p>\u2003The old man turned his head to look at his grown daughter. Touched by her intensity, he looked at her as he had not in a long time. And looking at her, he saw what was undeniably true\u2014she was being transformed from the inside out. Suddenly, he was overcome with an almost unbearable longing. He was a wreck and his life was a wreck, and it was soon coming to an end. Was it possible that even at this late date some of that light on his daughter\u2019s face could be his? So, hesitantly, he reached his hand out from under the sheet and took hers. In the next moments as he brokenly confessed his sins and his need and confessed a very tiny faith bolstered by his daughter\u2019s kiss, barrenness became fruitfulness, solitary disgrace became the welcoming embrace of the world\u2019s Maker, and rejection became joyous acceptance. When he opened his eyes, the broken walls of his life had become battlements of rubies.<\/p>     <h4>Contemporary Significance<\/h4>     <p>T<small>HIS PASSAGE SHOWS<\/small> us the heart of the gospel of Christ. God has reconciled his lost world to himself. He has not waited for us to find a way to bridge the gap between him and us, as he certainly could have in his own righteousness. After all, we are the ones who created the breach between him and ourselves, so let us find a way across it. But of course, there is no way from our side. For God to wait in the lonely isolation of his moral perfection for us to come to him would be to wait for all eternity. Our sinfulness makes it impossible to get ourselves to a place where we can stand before his blazing purity and survive. \u201cThe soul who sins\u2026will die\u201d (Ezek. 18:4).<\/p>     <p>\u2003Yet the amazing thing about God is that he gets no satisfaction from the richly deserved death of the sinner (Ezek. 18:32; 33:11). Some of the family members of the victims of Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh were disappointed when they were prevented from seeing him die. They wanted that satisfaction. Not so with God. Not even the death of the most heinous criminal brings a grim smile of satisfaction to the face of God. Rather, there is grief in his heart like the grief of a David who cried, \u201cO Absalom, my son, my son,\u201d over the death of his rebel son, who would have killed his father without a qualm.<\/p>     <p>\u2003So what did God do as an expression of his \u201cunfailing love,\u201d his \u201ceverlasting kindness,\u201d his \u201ccovenant of peace\u201d? What did he do so that the \u201cbarren woman\u201d could be surrounded with laughing children, the \u201cwidow\u201d could be married to the most wonderful husband in the world, and the \u201crejected\u201d divorc\u00e9e could know that the rejection was only for a moment while the acceptance was forever? What he did was to take all that proud emptiness, all that solitary self-sufficiency, all that demand for our own way, into himself.<\/p>     <p>\u2003This is the true face of God\u2014not the stern, implacable Judge dispassionately rehearsing the endless list of our crimes and in the end grimly meting out exactly what we have deserved. No, this \u201cMaker,\u201d this \u201cGod of all the earth,\u201d is our Father, who will go to any lengths to see that we do <em>not<\/em> get what we deserve. The judgment has been taken by the Judge, who can now proclaim that there is no more judgment outstanding against the accused.<\/p>     <p>\u2003Thus, from God\u2019s perspective, he will never pronounce judgment again (54:9). From his perspective, \u201cno weapon forged against\u201d his people will ever succeed again (54:17). That is, no further punishment or discipline is necessary because it has all been taken by God himself.<\/p>     <p>\u2003But that is from God\u2019s side. Suppose we do not continually avail ourselves of his provision of grace and mercy. Suppose we decide to use that grace so that we can persist in a life of sin. This would be like God\u2019s saying to us as he finishes cleaning out the garbage dump where we have been living and turning it into a lush vegetable garden, \u201cYou will never be sick and hungry again.\u201d That is true from God\u2019s perspective. But it assumes that we will continue to live in the middle of that garden. If we decide to move over to the next garbage dump and still try to claim those promises, we will discover that while the effects of that move are also covered in what God did for us in his self-giving, they will continue if we choose to live outside his grace.<\/p>     <p>\u2003There is nothing more God needs to do for his \u201ccovenant of peace\u201d to be ours forever. \u201cThe punishment that brought us peace was upon him, and by his wounds we are healed\u201d (53:5). We are \u201caccepted in the beloved.\u201d But there is something we must do to experience that covenant forever: We must continually choose to live under its terms.<\/p>     ",
