    "html": " <p> <i>And now saith Jehovah.<\/i>, By this verse he confirms the former statement, and yields more abundant consolation, by repeating that calling; and the testimony of conscience, which ought to be regarded by us as a fortress; for there is nothing that gives us greater distress and anxiety, than to entertain doubts by whose authority, or by whose direction everything is undertaken by us. For this reason Isaiah reminds us of the certainty of our calling. <\/p>\n <p> <i>Who formed me from the womb to be his servant.<\/i>, In the first place, godly teachers, along with Christ who is their Prince, say that they have been \u201cformed\u201d by a divine hand; because God always enriches and adorns with necessary gifts those whom he calls to the office of teaching, who derive from the one fountain of the Spirit all the gifts in which they excel. Thus \u201cthe Father hath sealed\u201d (<a class=\"ref\">John 6:27<\/a>) his Only-begotten Son, and next prepares others, according to their degree, to be fit for discharging their office. At the same time, he points out the end of the calling; for to this end have Apostles and teachers of the Church been appointed, to gather the Lord\u2019s scattered flock, that under Christ we may all be united in the same body. (<a class=\"ref\">Ephesians 4:11<\/a>.) In the world there is miserable dispersion, but in Christ there is <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03ba\u03b5\u03c6\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u1f77\u03c9\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2<\/span>,\u201ca gathering together\u201d of all, (<a class=\"ref\">Ephesians 1:10<\/a>,) as the Apostle speaks; for there can be no other bond of union. As to the word \u201ccreate,\u201d or \u201cform,\u201d it is to no purpose that some men speculate about it as relating to Christ\u2019s human existence, which was created; for it is clearer than noon-day, that the \u201cforming\u201d must be viewed as relating to office. <\/p>\n <p> <i>And though Israel be not gathered.<\/i>, The Jews read these words as a question: \u201cShall I not bring back Jacob? and shall Israel not be gathered?\u201d and supply the particle <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d4<\/span>,(<i>ha <\/i>). But that reading is excessively unnatural, and the Jews do not consider what was the Prophet\u2019s meaning, but, so far as lies in their power, corrupt the text, in order to conceal the disgrace of their nation. Some explain it, \u201cShall not be lost,\u201d or, \u201cShall not perish;\u201d for the verb <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d0\u05e1\u05e4 <\/span> <i>(asaph)<\/i>, sometimes denotes what we commonly call <i>(<\/i> <i>trousser <\/i> <i>) to truss.<\/i>, Those things which are intended to be preserved are \u201cgathered,\u201d and likewise those things which are intended to be consumed; and accordingly, when we mean that any person has been removed out of the world, we frequently use the vulgar phrase, \u201che is trussed,\u201d or, \u201che is despatched.\u201d <\/p>\n <p> <i>Yet I shall be glorious.<\/i>, To suppose the meaning to be, \u201cI have been sent, that Israel may not perish,\u201d would not be unsuitable; but I choose rather to follow a different interpretation, namely, \u201cThough Israel be not gathered, yet I shall be glorious;\u201d for it is probable that opposite things are contrasted with each other in this passage. If ministers have been set apart, for the salvation of men, it is glorious to them when many are brought to salvation; and when the contrary happens, it tends to their shame and disgrace. Paul calls those whom he had gained to Christ \u201chis glory and crown.\u201d (<a class=\"ref\">Philippians 4:1; 1 Thessalonians 2:19<\/a>.) On the other hand, when men perish, we receive from it nothing but shame and disgrace; for God appears to curse our labors, and not to deign to bestow on us the high honor of advancing his kingdom by our agency. But the Prophet declares that those who have served Christ shall nevertheless be glorious; for he speaks both of the head and of the members, as we have formerly remarked. Although therefore Israel refuse to be \u201cgathered,\u201d yet the ministry of Christ shall retain its glory unimpaired; for it will be ascribed to the baseness and wickedness of men, that they have not been \u201cgathered.\u201d <\/p>\n <p>In like manner, although the preachers of the Gospel be \u201cthe savor of death unto death\u201d to the reprobate, yet Paul declares that they have a sweet and delightful odor before God, who determines that wicked men shall thus be rendered the more inexcusable. God is indeed doubly glorified if success corresponds to their wishes; but when the ministers of the word have left nothing undone, though they have good reason to lament that their labor is unprofitable, still they must not repent of having pleased God, whose approbation is here contrasted with the perverse judgments of the whole world. As if the Prophet had said, \u201cThough men vehemently slander and load them with many reproaches, yet this ought to be calmly and patiently endured by them; because God judges differently, and bestows a crown of honor on their patience, which wicked men insolently slander. <\/p>\n <p> <i>And my God shall be my strength.<\/i>, When he says that it is enough that \u201cGod is their strength,\u201d the meaning corresponds to what goes before, that they ought not to be terrified by the multitude or power of their enemies, seeing that they are persuaded that their \u201cstrength\u201d lies in God. <\/p>",
