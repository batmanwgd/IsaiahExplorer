    "html": " <p>This parable demonstrates Isaiah&rsquo;s literary skill and is well known for its beautiful language and poetic structure. This is the only parable found in Isaiah&rsquo;s writings, and Elder James E. Talmage teaches that it is one of the most &ldquo;impressive&rdquo; examples of analogy in the entire Bible. In just a few verses, Isaiah tells his audience a poetic story about a wealthy master who builds a magnificent vineyard. Extensive planning, building, and spending, however, result in sour instead of sweet grapes. Therefore, after asking the community if he could have done anything more for the vines, the master destroys the vineyard. The parable concludes in verse 7 with Isaiah&rsquo;s identification of its major terms and an explanation of its application to the children of Israel.<\/p> <p>Isaiah employs a chiastic shift of voice in his vineyard parable, changing from a third person portrayal about the master and his new vineyard (vv. 1&ndash;2) to a first-person narration as the master himself speaks about his past efforts (vv. 3&ndash;4) and future plans (vv. 5&ndash;6), and then shifting back to a third-person description of the true Master and His vineyard (v. 7). This arrangement of third person (setup) \/ first person (questioning) \/ first person (promising) \/ third person (explanation) provides the audience with different perspectives so that they can better comprehend Isaiah&rsquo;s important message.<\/p> <p>In verses 1&ndash;2, Isaiah details careful preparations for the vineyard. The master chooses fertile soil on a &ldquo;fruitful hill,&rdquo; cultivates the soil, selects good stock, protects the crop, and prepares for the crop&rsquo;s harvest and storage. In chronological sequence, Isaiah describes that he &ldquo;fenced [the vineyard],&rdquo; &ldquo;gathered out the stones,&rdquo; &ldquo;planted it,&rdquo; &ldquo;built a tower in the midst of it,&rdquo; and &ldquo;made a wine-press.&rdquo; The master invests time, energy, and money into this project, and by building his own winepress in the garden, he shows that he anticipates a fruitful yield from his crop.<\/p> <p>When the vines yield only bitter fruit, the master is sorely disappointed. Isaiah questions his audience: &ldquo;What could have been done more?&rdquo; (v. 4). As the audience anticipates the obvious answer&mdash;absolutely nothing; the vineyard should be demolished&mdash;they unknowingly pronounce a judgment upon themselves. Speaking for the master in the first person, Isaiah tells of his plans to take away his protection and care. He says he will even command the clouds to cease their rains, and the audience senses he is going beyond the abilities of a normal farmer (v. 6). They begin to wonder, &ldquo;What is Isaiah really talking about?&rdquo; Isaiah then unveils the true meaning of the story: the master is the Lord, and His vineyard represents the house of Israel. The bitter fruit symbolizes the evil acts of his listeners, the wicked men of Judah, who deserve to be punished for their unrighteousness (v. 7). The unanticipated (antithetic) resolution of Isaiah&rsquo;s parable&mdash;the carefully prepared vineyard yielding bitter fruit&mdash;is comparable to the situation in the house of Israel. Even though they have been raised in sweet, spiritual conditions, they have become wicked.<\/p> <p>In verses 5 and 6, the Lord abandons the vineyard to the natural forces that destroy it. This process exemplifies the judgments of God, who usually does not immediately destroy or personally punish a wicked person. Rather, He simply leaves the sinner alone to face life&rsquo;s adversities and Satan&rsquo;s buffetings without the comfort and protection of His Spirit.<\/p> <p>In verse 7, Isaiah uses a synonymous parallel to emphasize the significance of Israel&rsquo;s betrayal against the Lord. He writes, &ldquo;[The Lord] looked for judgment, and behold, oppression \/ for righteousness, but behold, a cry.&rdquo; This parallelism is unique because of its striking alliteration and wordplay when the verse is read in Hebrew. Instead of the people providing &ldquo;justice&rdquo; (<em>mishpat),<\/em> they bring &ldquo;oppression&rdquo; (<em>mispach);<\/em> and their &ldquo;righteousness&rdquo; (<em>tsedakah)<\/em> is replaced with a mournful &ldquo;cry&rdquo; (<em>tse&rsquo;akah).<\/em> Isaiah matches the word his listeners first heard with a word that sounds similar but has a strong contrasting meaning. It would be similar to saying, &ldquo;The Lord looked for <em>righteousness <\/em>but instead saw <em>riotousness.<\/em>&rdquo; This literary device probably had a profound effect upon Isaiah&rsquo;s Israelite listeners, for the Semitic people believe there is a power inherent in words linked by strong contrast.<\/p> <p>Isaiah&rsquo;s &ldquo;Trojan Horse&rdquo; method of teaching is also called an &ldquo;entrapment parable,&rdquo; and it conveys a powerful message with clear visual images and a strong moral lesson. The master of the vineyard awaits sweet harvests from his beautiful vineyard, just as the Lord expects spiritual fruits from the house of Israel. His disappointment in the sour results will be shared by others, as Isaiah pronounces in the next verses.<\/p> ",
