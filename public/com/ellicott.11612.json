In <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 107:3<\/a>, however, it clearly stands for the south, and is probably used in that sense here. In this case \u201cfrom far\u201d stands for the south, probably for the distant Ethiopia, where Jewish exiles had already found their way (<a class=\"ref\">Zephaniah 3:10<\/a>).<\/p>\n <p>From the land of Sinim.\u2014The region thus named is clearly the ultima Thule of the prophet\u2019s horizon, and this excludes the \u201cSinites\u201d of Canaan (<a class=\"ref\">Genesis 10:17<\/a>), and the Sin (Pelusium) of Egypt. Modern scholars are almost unanimous in making it refer to the Chinese. Ph\u0153nician or Babylonian commerce may have made that people known, at least by name, to the prophet. Recent Chinese researches have brought to light traditions that in B.C. 2353 (and again in B.C. 1110) a people came from a strange western land, bringing with them a tortoise, on the shell of which was a history of the world, in strange characters \u201clike tadpoles.\u201d It is inferred that this was a cuneiform inscription, and the theory has been recently maintained that this was the origin of the present Chinese mode of writing. (See Cheyne\u2019s \u201cExcursus,\u201d 2 p. 20, and an elaborate article on \u201cChina and Assyria\u201d in the Quarterly Review for October, 1882.) Porcelain with Chinese characters has been found, it may be added, in the ruins of the Egyptian Thebes (Wilkinson, Ancient Egyptians, 1st ser., iii. 106-109). All recent discoveries tend to the conclusion that the commerce of the great ancient monarchies was wider than scholars of the sixteenth century imagined. The actual immigration of Jews into China is believed to have taken place about B.C. 200 (Delitzsch in loc).<\/p>",
