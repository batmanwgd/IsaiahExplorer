There is among the pagan no recorded prediction on the subject, as there is among the Jews, that when he shall have come, it may be said that a prediction is accomplished.&rsquo;<\/p><p>And before-time&mdash;Formerly; before the event occurred.<\/p><p><em>That we may say<\/em>&mdash;That it may be said; that there may be evidence, or reason for the affirmation.<\/p><p><em>He is righteous<\/em>&mdash;The words &lsquo;he is&rsquo; are not in the Hebrew The original is simply &lsquo;righteous&rsquo; (\u05e6\u05d3\u05d9\u05e7 tsadd\u0131\u0302yq), just, that is, it is just, or true; the prediction is fulfilled. It does not refer to the character of God, but to the certainty of the fulfillment of the prediction.<\/p><p><em>There is none that showeth<\/em>&mdash;There is no one among the worshippers of false gods, the soothsayers and necromancers, that has predicted these events.<\/p><p><em>None that heareth your words<\/em>&mdash;There is no one that has heard such a prediction among you.<\/p> ",
