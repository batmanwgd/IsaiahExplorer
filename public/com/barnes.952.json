    "html": "<p><em>For he saith<\/em>&mdash;This verse, and the subsequent verses to <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 10:11<\/a> , contain the vaunting of the king of Assyria, and the descriptions of his own confidence of success.<\/p><p><em>Are not my princes altogether kings?<\/em>&mdash;This is a confident boast of his &ldquo;own&rdquo; might and power. His own dominion was so great that even his princes were endowed with the ordinary power and &ldquo;regalia&rdquo; of kings. The word &ldquo;princes,&rdquo; may here refer either to those of his own family and court&mdash;to the satraps and officers of power in his army, or around his throne: or more probably, it may refer to the subordinate governors whom he had set over the provinces which he had conquered. &lsquo;Are they not clothed with royal power and majesty? Are they not of equal splendor with the other monarchs at the earth?&rsquo; How great, then, must have been his &ldquo;own&rdquo; rank and glory to be placed &ldquo;over&rdquo; such illustrious sovereigns! It will be recollected, that a common title which oriental monarchs give themselves, is that of King of kings; see <a class=\"ref\">Ezekiel 26:7; Daniel 2:37; Ezra 7:12<\/a>. The oriental princes are still distinguished for their sounding titles, and particularly for their claiming dominion over all other princes, and the supremacy over all other earthly powers.<\/p>",
