    "html": " <p>The gathering of Israel will be an occasion of great joy for both heaven and earth (\"Sing, O heavens; and be joyful, O earth\"; 49:13) and a great blessing to those gathered (\"smitten no more; for the Lord hath comforted his people, and will have mercy upon his afflicted\"; 49:13).<\/p> <p>Despite these promises, the people of Israel feel that they have been forgotten by the Lord (49:14). In tender expressions of love, the Lord assures them that he has not forgotten (49:15). He compares himself to a loving mother and says his love for his covenant people are found in the marks on his hands (49:16). Though a mother may forget her child, the Lord will hold his children in remembrance forever.<\/p> <p> In the gathering, the descendants of Israel (\"thy children\"; 49:17) will come in great numbers (49:19-20). Though many may be lost through the dispersal and through apostasy, in the gathering, Zion will multiply with many inhabitants, so many that she will require more space to dwell in than before. Israel, who has felt abandoned and desolate, will be amazed to see so many descendants (49:21).<\/p> <p>These prophecies have an application both for the Jews and for those who enter the Lord's covenant through baptism into The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The Lord will never forget his promises to the Jews and will bring them back to the land of Palestine in great numbers. The Lord will also make good on his promises to other people throughout the world, sending forth missionaries and bringing into the fold all who will come.<\/p> <blockquote> <i>Sing,<\/i> <u>O heavens<\/u>;     <br>and be <i>joyful,<\/i> <u>O earth<\/u>;     <br>[for the feet of those who are in the east shall be established;]     <br>and <i>break forth into singing,<\/i> <u>O mountains<\/u>:     <br>[for they shall be smitten no more;]     <br>for the Lord hath <i>comforted <\/i><u>his people<\/u>,     <br>and will have <i>mercy <\/i>upon <u>his afflicted<\/u>.
