    "html": "<p>By now addressing Hezekiah&rsquo;s people directly, Rabshakeh insults the king&rsquo;s delegation and repudiates the king&rsquo;s authority. He additionally challenges Israel&rsquo;s God Jehovah as being unable to deliver his people, portraying Hezekiah as a deceiver for affirming that he<em>can<\/em> deliver them. What distinguishes Jehovah&rsquo;s covenant people from other nations, however, is their long history of divine deliverance even when outnumbered and outmatched by the enemy: &ldquo;In the God of my salvation I will trust without fear; for Jehovah was my strength and my song when he became my salvation&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3OTAzXQ==\">Isaiah 12:2<\/a>).<\/p> ",
