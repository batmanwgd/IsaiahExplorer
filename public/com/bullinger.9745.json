    "html": " <p> <em>the LORD*.<\/em>, One of the 134 passages where Jehovah, in the primitive text, was altered by the <i>Sopherim<\/i>, to <em>\"Adonai\"<\/em>,. See App-32. <\/p>\n\n <p> <em>a virgin.<\/em>, Hebrew the virgin: i.e. some definite well-known damsel, whose identity was then unmistakable, though unknown to us. See <a class=\"ref\">Matthew 1:21-23, Luke 1:31<\/a>. See App-101. <\/p>\n\n <p> <em>virgin<\/em>,= damsel. Hebrew. <i>ha-\"almah<\/i>,. It occurs seven times (<a class=\"ref\">Genesis 24:43. Exodus 2:8. Psalms 68:25. Proverbs 21:19. Song of Solomon 1:3; Song of Solomon 6:8<\/a>, and <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3Nzk3XQ==\">Isaiah 7:14<\/a>). The Hebrew for virgin (in our technical sense) is <i>bethulah<\/i>, and occurs fifty times (2 x 52, see App-10). Its first occurrence is <a class=\"ref\">Genesis 24:16<\/a>, where, compared with <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 7:43<\/a>, it shows that while every <i>Bethulah<\/i>, is indeed an <i>Almah<\/i>, yet not every <i>Almah<\/i>, is a <i>Bethulah<\/i>,. The prophecy does not lose its Messianic character, for Mary, in whom it was fulfilled, is designated by the same holy inspiring Spirit as <em>\"parthenos\"<\/em>, (not <i>gune)<\/i>,. As a sign to Ahaz this damsel was an <i>almah<\/i>,. As a sign, when the prophecy was fulfilled (or filled full), it was Mary, the <i>parthenos<\/i>, or virgin. <\/p>\n\n <p> <em>shall conceive, and bear<\/em>,= is pregnant and beareth. Reference to Pentateuch. The two words occur together only here, <a class=\"ref\">Genesis 16:11<\/a>, and <a class=\"ref\">Judges 13:5, Judges 13:7<\/a>; and <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3Nzk1XQ==\">Isaiah 7:12<\/a>, shows that birth was imminent. Perhaps the <i>Almah<\/i>, was <em>\"Abi\"<\/em>, (<a class=\"ref\">2 Kings 18:2; 2 Chronicles 29:1<\/a>), but the son was not necessarily Hezekiah. See App-101. <\/p>\n\n <p> <em>Immanuel<\/em>,= <em>\"GOD (\"El) with us\"<\/em>,. Most codices, and six early printed editions, give it as two words. Some, with two early printed editions, as one word. <\/p>",
