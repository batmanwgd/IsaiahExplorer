The vision, meaning the Divine revelation of all the prophets, is a book or letter that is sealed - is not easily understood. This is delivered to one that is learned - instructed in the law. Read this; and he saith, I cannot, for it is sealed; a full proof that he does not wish to know the contents else he would apply to the prophet to get it explained. See Kimchi on the place. <\/p>\n\n <p> <em>And their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men \"And vain is their fear of me teaching the commandments of men\"\u2014<\/em>, I read for <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d5\u05ea\u05d4\u05d9 <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, vattehi<\/span>, <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d5\u05ea\u05d4\u05d5 <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, vethohu<\/span>, with the Septuagint, <a class=\"ref\">Matthew 15:9; Mark 8:7<\/a>; and for <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05de\u05dc\u05de\u05d3\u05d4 <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, melummedah<\/span>, <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05de\u05dc\u05de\u05d3\u05d9\u05dd <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, melummedim<\/span>, with the Chaldee. <\/p>",
