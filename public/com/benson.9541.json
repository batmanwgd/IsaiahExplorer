Josephus tells us, that immediately before the destruction of Jerusalem, it was a matter of scorn to be religious. The translators reach the meaning of the word by<i> prey:<\/i> the wicked, like wild beasts, endeavouring to devour such as are not as bad as themselves: where wickedness rules, innocence is oppressed. For they that are simple and innocent are outwitted by the crafty and fraudulent, as not being willing, or rather, not daring to oppose fraud with fraud, but doing all things in sincerity.<i> And the Lord saw it<\/i> \u2014 Took notice of it; it was not hid from him. It is spoken of God after the manner of men.<i> And it displeased him,<\/i> &c. \u2014 As if he had said, If you would know why God is so angry with you, it is for such things as these; the Lord observes them, and they are great evils in his eyes.<\/p> ",
