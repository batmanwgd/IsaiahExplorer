In turning to other gods, the Israelites sought to avoid judgment from Jehovah. But now their worst fears will be realized; they will learn that they cannot escape justice (65:6-7). The Lord will choose their afflictions and troubles; they will not choose them. As for the Lord deluding us, or causing us to be deluded, Joseph Smith said, \"The devil could not compel mankind to do evil; all was voluntary&hellip;. God would not exert any compulsory means, and the devil could not.\" In other words, we are deluded because of our choices and desires, not because of the works or actions of either the Lord or Satan.<\/p> <p><i>when I called\/evil before mine eyes\/chose that in which I delighted not.<\/i> The contrast between 65:3 and 65:4 demonstrates that the things that delight the people are exactly the things that do not delight the Lord.
