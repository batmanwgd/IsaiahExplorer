Others, citing <a class=\"ref\">2 Chr. 36:15-16<\/a>, have said that the verse refers to prophets' being called to preach to Jerusalem, but the Chronicles reference pertain to a later time than that of Isaiah-although the patterns of the prophets are similar (see <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODIyNiI6NH0=\">Isaiah 30:8-11<\/a>). Verse 4 also fits the calling and mission of Joseph Smith and the elders of restored Israel, who were to cause the wisdom of the wise men to perish (see <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MjA4XQ==\">Isaiah 29:14<\/a>). It would be consistent with chapter 49 to identify the servant \"me\" as restored Israel.<\/p>     ",
