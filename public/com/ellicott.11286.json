The nobles of Judah, who had been tyrannous and oppressive (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3Njc4XQ==\">Isaiah 1:23<\/a>), should become a true aristocracy, beneficent and protecting. Of both the \u201cking\u201d and the \u201cman\u201d it is true that they find their fulfilment in the true servant of the Lord, who is also the ideal king. <\/p>\n <p>As rivers of water . . .\u2014The words paint the picture of the two great blessings of an Eastern landscape: the streams that turn the desert into an oasis, the \u201crock\u201d throwing its dark shadow as a shelter from the noontide heat. The word for \u201crock\u201d is the same as that used for Assyria in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MjYwXQ==\">Isaiah 31:9<\/a>, and is obviously chosen to emphasise the contrast. <\/p>",
