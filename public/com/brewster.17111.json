    "html": "<p><b>(<a class=\"ref\">1 Nephi 21:22; 2 Nephi 6:6<\/a>).<\/b>\"<i>I will lift up mine hand to the Gentiles, and set up my standard to the people.<\/i>\" The covenant children of Israel will come from all the gentile nations of the earth. The Lord extends His hand to all to partake of the saving covenants and ordinances of His gospel. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the standard to which these converts will gather in order to make their covenants with Christ and receive their saving ordinances. (See DCE, 559-60.) Within the Church is found the fulness of the gospel or the new and everlasting covenant. (See DCE, 381-82.) The Lord declared: \"And even so I have sent mine everlasting covenant into the world, to be a light to the world, and to be a standard for my people, and for the Gentiles to seek to it.\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 45:9<\/a>.) The Book of Mormon, one of the \"standard works\" of the Church, has also been identified by the Lord as \"a standard unto my people, which are of the house of Israel.\" (<a class=\"ref\">2 Nephi 29:2<\/a>.)<\/p>     <p>It is of interest to note that Nephi states that \"after they [scattered Israel] shall be nursed by the Gentiles, and the Lord has lifted up his hand upon the Gentiles and <i>set them up for a standard,<\/i>\u2026 the Lord God will raise up a mighty nation among the Gentiles.\" (<a class=\"ref\">1 Nephi 22:6-7<\/a>; italics added.) Has not the land of America, the birth place of the Restoration and home of the headquarters of the restored Church, stood out as a standard (rallying point) for the freedom-loving and God-fearing people of the earth? Consider the words of Joseph Smith: \"The Constitution of the United States is a glorious standard. . . . It is a heavenly banner. \u2026 It is like a great tree under whose branches men from every clime can be shielded from the burning rays of the sun.\" (TPJS, 147.)<\/p>",
