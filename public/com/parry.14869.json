The fact that \"unclean\" people, lions, or ravenous beasts (35:8-10; 51:10-11) will not pass over the highway indicates its connection with the straight and narrow path. For this meaning of <i>highway,<\/i> see 40:3; 42:16; 49:11; 57:14; 62:10.<\/p> <p><i>which shall be left.<\/i> This phrase speaks concerning the remnant of His people, <i>which shall be left,<\/i> identified in 11:11.<\/p> <p><i>like as it was to Israel in the day that he came up out of the land of Egypt.<\/i> Once again the prophet reminds us that the Lord's almighty power saved Moses and the Israelites from Pharaoh and his army. In doing so, Isaiah gives us confidence that the Lord will prevent all worldly powers from halting our latter-day gathering.<\/p> ",
