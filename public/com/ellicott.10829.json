They were heroes and valiant men only in and for their cups. To such men it seemed a light matter to acquit the guilty and condemn the guiltless. The prophet dwells on the familiar truth, Judex damnatur cum nocens absolvitur. The Targum, it may be noticed, has \u201cthe mammon of falsehood\u201d (comp. Luke xvi, 9), for the \u201creward\u201d of the Hebrew. <\/p>",
