Chapter 40 gave a general introduction to the two great themes, God\u2019s love and his unique power. Then 41:1\u201342:9 gave a more specific introduction to God\u2019s case against the idols and to the two servants: the one fearful and the other ministering God\u2019s justice to the world. Now in 42:10\u201344:22 there is even greater specificity as God declares his intention to deliver his people from their distress and to use them as his witnesses against the idols. The section has two parts, generally following these two themes: 42:10\u201343:7 addresses the certainty of God\u2019s deliverance, and 43:8\u201344:22 deals with how that deliverance will witness for God and against the idols.<\/p>     ",
