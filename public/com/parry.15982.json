In the broad sense, idolatry involves any belief, feeling, or activity that puts something else before God.<\/p> <p><i>iniquities of your fathers.<\/i> The sins of Israel are added to the sins of her ancestors. Both ancestor and descendant are guilty of the same thing.<\/p> <p><i>burned incense upon the mountains\/blasphemed me upon the hills.<\/i> These phrases are references to idol worship, which often occurred on mountains and hills. An elevated place was said to be more effective in attracting the attention of Baal; such worship of idols was a perversion and counterfeit of true temple worship, which also was performed on mountaintops (57:5, 7).<\/p> <p> <i>measure their former work.<\/i> The Lord will give us in punishment the exact measure of what we have earned through our works.<\/p> <p><i>into their bosom.<\/i> See commentary on 65:6.<\/p> ",
