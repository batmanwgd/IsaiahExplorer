He therefore calls them \u201ca holy people,\u201d because the Lord hath separated and consecrated them to himself; for, although he governs all nations, he has deigned to choose the seed of Abraham, that he might make them the object of his peculiar care. (<a class=\"ref\">Exodus 19:6<\/a>.) <\/p> \n <p> <i>The redeemed of Jehovah<\/i>. In the sense now stated, God declares that they shall be a holy people, when he shall appear as their Savior and Redeemer; for, as the people are said to be \u201cprofaned\u201d when they lie amidst filth, being afflicted and distressed by the reproaches of the wicked, so they are said to be \u201csanctified,\u201d when the Lord actually shews that he presides over their salvation. This was accomplished by a wonderful redemption; and at that time God also testified that he remembered his heritage, which, in the eyes of men, he appeared to have forsaken and disregarded; for in these words, Sought out, not forsaken, is denoted a contrast between the time when God made a divorce from his people, and the time when he again reconciled to himself those whom he had cast off. <\/p> ",
