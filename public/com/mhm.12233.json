    "html": "<p>  9  O Zion, that bringest good tidings, get thee up into the high  mountain  O Jerusalem, that bringest good tidings, lift up thy  voice with strength  lift <i>it<\/i> up, be not afraid  say unto the  cities of Judah, Behold your God!    10  Behold, the Lord G<b>OD<\/b> will come with strong <i>hand,<\/i> and his  arm shall rule for him: behold, his reward <i>is<\/i> with him, and his  work before him.    11  He shall feed his flock like a shepherd: he shall gather the  lambs with his arm, and carry <i>them<\/i> in his bosom, <i>and<\/i> shall  gently lead those that are with young.  <\/p>  <p>  It was promised  (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 40:5<\/a>)  <i>that the glory of the Lord shall be revealed <\/i> that is it with  the hopes of which God's people must be comforted. Now here we are  told,<\/p>  <p>  I. How it shall be revealed,   <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 40:9<\/a>.  1. It shall be revealed to Zion and Jerusalem  notice shall be given of  it to the remnant that are left in Zion and Jerusalem, the poor of the  land, who were vine-dressers and husbandmen  it shall be told them that  their brethren shall return to them. This shall be told also to the  captives who belonged to Zion and Jerusalem, and retained their  affection for them. Zion is said to <i>dwell with the daughter of  Babylon<\/i>  (<a class=\"ref\">Zechariah 2:7<\/a>)  and there she receives notice of Cyrus's gracious proclamation  and so  the margin reads it, <i>O thou that tellest good tidings to Zion,<\/i>  &c., meaning the persons who were employed in publishing that  proclamation  let them do it with a good will, let them make the  country ring of it, and let them tell it to the sons of Zion in their  own language, <i>saying to them, Behold your God.<\/i>  2. It shall be published by Zion and Jerusalem (so the text reads it)  those that remain there, or that have already returned, when they find  the deliverance proceeding towards perfection, let them proclaim it in  the most public places, whence they may be best heard by all the cities  of Judah  let them proclaim it as loudly as they can: let them <i>lift  up their voice with strength,<\/i> and not be afraid of overstraining  themselves  let them not be afraid lest the enemy should hear it and  quarrel with them, or lest it should not prove true, or not such good  tidings as at first it appeared  let them say to the cities of Judah,  and all the inhabitants of the country, <i>Behold your God.<\/i> When  God is going on with the salvation of his people, let them  industriously spread the news among their friends, let them tell them  that it is God that has done it  whoever were the instruments, God was  the author  it is <i>their<\/i> God, a God in covenant with them, and he  does it as theirs, and they will reap the benefit and comfort of it.  \"Behold him, take notice of his hand in it, and look above second  causes  behold, the God you have long looked for has come at last  (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 25:9<\/a>):  <i>This is our God, we have waited for him.<\/i>\" This may refer to the  invitation which was sent forth from Jerusalem to the cities of Judah,  as soon as they had set up an altar, immediately upon their return out  of captivity, to come and join with them in their sacrifices,   <a class=\"ref\">Ezra 3:2-4<\/a>.  \"When the worship of God is set up again, send notice of it to all your  brethren, that they may share with you in the comfort of it.\" But this  was to have its full accomplishment in the apostles' public and  undaunted preaching of the gospel to all nations, beginning at  Jerusalem. The voice crying in the wilderness gave notice that he was  coming  but now notice is given that he has come. <i>Behold the Lamb of  God <\/i> take a full view of your Redeemer. Behold your King, behold  your God.<\/p>  <p>  II. What that glory is which shall be revealed. \"Your God will come,  will show himself,\"<\/p>  <p>  1. \"With the power and greatness of a prince  (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 40:10<\/a>):  <i>He will come with strong hand,<\/i> too strong to be obstructed,  though it may be opposed. His strong hand shall subdue his people to  himself, and shall restrain and conquer his and their enemies. He will  come who is strong enough to break through all the difficulties that  lie in his way.\" Our Lord Jesus was full of power, a mighty Saviour.  Some read, it, <i>He will come against the mighty one,<\/i> and  overpower him, overcome him. Satan is the strong man armed  but our  Lord Jesus is stronger than he, and he shall make it to appear that he  is so, for,  (1.) He shall reign in defiance of all opposition: <i>His arm shall  rule,<\/i> shall overrule <i>for him,<\/i> for the fulfilling of his  counsels, to his own glory  for he is his own end.  (2.) He shall recompense to all according to their works, as a  righteous Judge: <i>His reward is with him <\/i> he brings along with  him, as a returning prince, punishments for the rebels and preferments  for his loyal subjects.  (3.) He shall proceed and accomplish his purpose: <i>His work is before  him,<\/i> that is, he knows perfectly well what he has to do, which way  to go about it, and how to compass it. <i>He himself knows what he will  do.<\/i><\/p>  <p>  2. \"With the pity and tenderness of a shepherd,\"   <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 40:11<\/a>.  God is the <i>Shepherd of Israel<\/i>  (<a class=\"ref\">Psalm 80:1<\/a>)  Christ is the good Shepherd,   <a class=\"ref\">John 10:11<\/a>.  The same that rules with the strong hand of a prince leads and feeds  with the kind hand of a shepherd.  (1.) He takes care of all his flock, the little flock: <i>He shall feed  his flock like a shepherd.<\/i> His word is food for his flock to feed  on  his ordinances are fields for them to feed in  his ministers are  under-shepherds that are appointed to attend them.  (2.) He takes particular care of those that most need his care, the  lambs that are weak, and cannot help themselves, and are unaccustomed  to hardship, and <i>those that are with young,<\/i> that are therefore  heavy, and, if any harm be done them, are in danger of casting their  young. He particularly takes care for a succession, that it may not  fail or be cut off. The good Shepherd has tender care for children that  are towardly and hopeful, for young converts, that are setting out in  the way to heaven, for weak believers, and those that are of a  sorrowful spirit. These are the lambs of his flock, that shall be sure  to want nothing that their case requires.  [1.] He will gather them in the arms of his power  his strength shall  be made <i>perfect in their weakness,<\/i>   <a class=\"ref\">2 Corinthians 12:9<\/a>.  He will gather them in when they wander, gather them up when they fall,  gather them together when they are dispersed, and gather them home to  himself at last  and all this with his own arm, out of which none shall  be able to pluck them,   <a class=\"ref\">John 10:28<\/a>.  [2.] He will carry them in the bosom of his love and cherish them  there. When they tire or are weary, are sick and faint, when they meet  with foul ways, he will carry them on, and take care they are not left  behind.  [3.] He will gently lead them. By his word he requires no more  service, and by his providence he inflicts no more trouble, than he  will fit them for  for he considers their frame.<\/p>",
