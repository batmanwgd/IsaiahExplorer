These are the meek or teachable of the earth who open their hearts to the penetrating power of the Spirit. President Joseph Fielding Smith said: \"The Spirit of God speaking to the spirit of man has power to impart truth with greater effect and understanding than the truth can be imparted by personal contact even with heavenly beings. Through the Holy Ghost the truth is woven into the very fibre and sinews of the body so that it cannot be forgotten.\" (DS 1:47-48.)<\/p>",
