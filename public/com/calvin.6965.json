    "html": " <p> <i>And the people shall know. <\/i>,By the word <i>people <\/i>,I understand, not the Jews, but rather the Israelites; and, indeed, the Prophet removes doubt by expressly naming <i>Ephraim <\/i>,. He likewise adds <i>Samaria <\/i>,, which was the metropolis of that <i>people <\/i>,, or of the ten tribes; for fortified cities, conceiving themselves to be placed beyond the reach of danger, are much more insolent in their pretensions. They think that they will always have the remedy in their hands by capitulating with the enemy, though the whole country were laid waste. On this account Isaiah threatens that they will not be exempted from the general calamity. He says that all will feel that the predictions which were uttered by the mouth of God will not be without effect. By the word <i>know <\/i>,, which relates to actual experience, he indirectly reproves their unbelief; as if he had said, \u201cSince I speak to the deaf, and you set no value on the warnings which I now address to you, the actual event will teach you, but too late.\u201d <\/p>,\n <p> <i>Who say. <\/i>,Here the Prophet attacks the obstinacy and rebellion of that people, because, though they had once and again been chastised by God\u2019s scourges, and that sharply, they were so far from repentance that they reckoned their losses to be gain, and became more hardened. Assuredly they who thus insolently mock at God are not brought to obedience without being reduced to utter weakness. Now, such an insult openly and avowedly provokes God\u2019s anger, and therefore the Prophet says that it proceeds from <i>the haughtiness and pride of the heart <\/i>,. Hence it follows that it is right to apply to knotty timber chisels that are harder still. <\/p>,",
