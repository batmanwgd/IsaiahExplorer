It gives the reason why the judgment, here denounced, should be certainly inflicted, because he who had undertaken it was<i> the Lord of hosts,<\/i> and therefore able to effect it; and<i> the Holy One,<\/i> and<i> the Redeemer of Israel,<\/i> whom the Babylonians had cruelly oppressed, whose quarrel God would avenge upon them, and whom he had determined and promised to deliver out of their hands. If the words be considered as a pathetical exclamation, or acclamation of God\u2019s people, they thereby ascribe to God, as their God and Redeemer, this wonderful work of breaking the staff of their oppressors: and they make their boast of, and celebrate him for, this glorious deliverance.<\/p> ",
