    "html": "<p> The great thing which is brought to pass by means of this catastrophe is the redemption of His people. <em> \u201cAnd I lead the blind by a way that they know not; by steps that they know not, I make them walk: I turn dark space before them into light, and rugged places into a plain. These are the things that I carry out, and do not leave.\u201d<\/em> The \u201cblind\u201d are those who have been deprived of sight by their sin, and the consequent punishment. The unknown ways in which Jehovah leads them, are the ways of deliverance, which are known to Him alone, but which have now been made manifest in the fulness of time. The \u201cdark space\u201d (<em> m achsha\u0302k <\/em> ) is their existing state of hopeless misery; the \u201crugged places\u201d (<em> ma\u201ba\u0306qassh\u0131\u0304m <\/em> ) the hindrances that met them, and dangers that threatened them on all sides in the foreign land. The mercy of Jehovah adopts the blind, lights up the darkness, and clears every obstacle away. \u201c<em> These are the things<\/em> \u201d (<em> hadd e bha\u0302r\u0131\u0304m <\/em> ): this refers to the particulars already sketched out of the double manifestation of Jehovah in judgment and in mercy. The perfects of the attributive clause are perfects of certainty.<\/p>",
