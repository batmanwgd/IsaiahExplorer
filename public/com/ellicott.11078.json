The words are abrupt, and we have to read the thoughts that lie below them. The \u201cchild of the threshing-floor \u201cis none other than Israel, thought of as the corn which is under God\u2019s chastisements, Assyrian and Chald\u00e6an invasions, Babylonian exile, and the like, severing the wheat from the chaff (<a class=\"ref\">Micah 4:12-13; Jeremiah 51:33; Matthew 3:3<\/a>). The prophet looks on those chastisements with yearning pity, but he cannot \u201cgo beyond the word of the Lord\u201d (<a class=\"ref\">Numbers 24:13<\/a>), and this is all that he has to tell his people. The oppressor shall in the end be overthrown, but that which lies between the present and that far-off future is, as yet, concealed from him.<\/p>",
