    "html": "<p>Continuing Jehovah&rsquo;s personal sign to Ahaz, Isaiah predicts a time of distress in the son&rsquo;s early years as he learns to &ldquo;reject the evil and choose the good&rdquo;&mdash;that is, to keep the terms of Jehovah&rsquo;s covenant and repudiate all else. The son&rsquo;s dietary fare of &ldquo;cream and honey&rdquo; implies a sufficiency&mdash;a covenant blessing&mdash;but not an abundance. At times of national crisis, Jehovah&rsquo;s people resorted to the nomadic lifestyle of their ancestors, saying, &ldquo;To your tents, O Israel!&rdquo; (<a class=\"ref\">1 Kings 12:16; 2 Kings 13:5<\/a>). Meanwhile, the lands of those threatening Ahaz would &ldquo;lie forsaken,&rdquo; subjected to covenant curses.<\/p> ",
