The \u201cnew things\u201d which Jehovah now foretells before their visible development (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NTI1XQ==\">Isaiah 43:19<\/a>), are the restoration of Israel, for which the defeat of their oppressors prepares the say, and the conversion of the heathen, to which an impulse is given by the fact that God thus glorifies Himself in His people. <br> <\/p> ",
