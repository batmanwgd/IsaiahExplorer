    "html": "<p>Covenant curses in chapter 5 culminate with the reprobates of Jehovah&rsquo;s people perishing like &ldquo;stubble&rdquo; and &ldquo;weeds&rdquo; in his Day of Judgment. Together with the parallel terms &ldquo;decay&rdquo; and &ldquo;dust,&rdquo; these chaos motifs contrast the wicked of Jehovah&rsquo;s people with the righteous who represent the grain and portray the wicked&rsquo;s final state. As &ldquo;roots&rdquo; and &ldquo;blossoms&rdquo; signify ancestors and descendants, evildoers are cut off from all familial ties. Because they despised and reviled Jehovah&rsquo;s law and words that are the terms of his covenant, the king of Assyria\/Babylon&mdash;his<em>fire<\/em> and<em>flame<\/em>&mdash;will burn them up.<\/p> ",
