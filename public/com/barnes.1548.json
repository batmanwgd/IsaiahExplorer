He followed on, and devoted them to discomfiture and ruin. <\/p> <p> <em>And passed safely <\/em>&mdash;Margin, as Hebrew, &lsquo;In peace.&rsquo; That is, he followed them uninjured; they had no power to rally, he was not led into ambush, and he was safe as far as he chose to pursue them. <\/p> <p> <em>Even by the way that he had not gone with his feet <\/em>&mdash;By a way that he had not been accustomed to march; in an unusual journey; in a land of strangers. Cyrus had passed his early years on the east of the Euphrates. In his conquests he crossed that river, and extended his march beyond even the river Halys to the western extremity of Asia, and even to Egypt and the Red Sea. The idea here is, that he had not traveled in these regions until he did it for purposes of conquest&mdash;an idea which is strictly in accordance with the truth of history. <\/p> ",
