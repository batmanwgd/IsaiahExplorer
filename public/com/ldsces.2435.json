The wicked, on the other hand, know no peace. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODc2OSI6MTB9\">Isaiah 57:3&ndash;12<\/a>refers to general wickedness and uses Israel&rsquo;s faithlessness to God, described here and in other places as adultery, for an example (see <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODc3MyI6Mn0=\">vv. 7&ndash;8<\/a>). &ldquo;I will declare thy righteousness, and thy works,&rdquo; the Lord said, &ldquo;for they shall not profit thee&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4Nzc4XQ==\">v. 12<\/a>). The book of Proverbs perhaps states it best: &ldquo;Treasures of wickedness profit nothing: but righteousness delivereth from death&rdquo; (<a class=\"ref\">Proverbs 10:2<\/a>).<\/p><p class=\"cite\">LDS Church Educational System Old Testament Student Manual, 1 Kings&ndash;Malachi, Religion 302, Chapter 18, Item 7<\/p>",
