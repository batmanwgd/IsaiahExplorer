    "html": "<p><em>Thy princes...<\/em>&mdash;This is an explanation of the previous verse. Princes mean here those attached to the royal family; those who by rank, or office, had an influence over the people.<\/p><p><em>Rebellious<\/em>&mdash;Against God. The corruption of a nation commonly begins with the rulers.<\/p><p><em>Companions of thieves<\/em>&mdash;That is, they connive at the doings of robbers; they do not bring them to justice; they are their accomplices, and are easily bribed to acquit them.<\/p><p><em>Every one loveth gifts<\/em>&mdash;Every magistrate can be bribed.<\/p><p><em>Followeth afar rewards<\/em>&mdash;\u05e8\u05d3\u05e3 rode\u0304ph. This word denotes the act of pursuing after in order to obtain something; and means here that they made it an object to obtain rewards by selling or betraying justice They sell justice to the highest bidder. No more distressing condition of a people can be conceived than this, where justice could not be secured between man and man, and where the wicked could oppress the poor, the widow, and the orphan, as much as they pleased, because they knew they could bribe the judge.<\/p><p><em>They judge not<\/em>&mdash;They do not render justice to; <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NjcyXQ==\">Isaiah 1:17<\/a>. The Chaldee has well expressed the sense of a part of this verse: &lsquo;They say, each one to his neighbor, Favour me in my judgment, or do me good in it, and I will recompense you in your cause.&rsquo;<\/p><p><em>The cause of the widow come unto them<\/em>&mdash;Or, rather, come before them. They would not take up her cause, but rather the cause of those who were esteemed able to offer a bribe, and from whom a gift might be expected, if a decision was made in their favor.<\/p>",
