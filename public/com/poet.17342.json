    "html": "<p>In chapter 53, Isaiah gives the most sublime messianic prophecy in all the scriptures. Within just a few verses, he provides a preview of four major aspects of Christ's life and mission: (1) his mortal life as the \"despised man\" (vs. 1-3); (2) his atonement (vs. 4-6); (3) his trial and crucifixion as an \"innocent lamb\" (vs. 7-9); and (4) his postmortal glory as an exalted son (vs. 10-12). Elder Bruce R. McConkie has said,<\/p> <p>As our New Testament now stands, we find Matthew (<a class=\"ref\">Matt. 8:17<\/a>), Philip (<a class=\"ref\">Acts 8:27-35<\/a>), Paul (<a class=\"ref\">Rom. 4:25<\/a>), and Peter (<a class=\"ref\">1 Pet. 2:24-25<\/a>) all quoting, paraphrasing, enlarging upon, and applying to the Lord Jesus various of the verses in this great 53rd chapter of Isaiah. How many sermons have been preached, how many lessons have been taught, how many testimonies have been borne\u2014both in ancient Israel and in the meridian of time\u2014using the utterances of this chapter as the text, we can scarcely imagine.
