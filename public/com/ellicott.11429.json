The word is that of one who looks on the Mediterranean, and thinks of the unexplored regions that lie in it and around. It is one of Isaiah\u2019s favourite words in this aspect of its meaning.<\/p> \n<p>A drop of a bucket.\u2014Better, on a bucket. Such a drop adds nothing to the weight which the bearer feels; as little do the nations and the isles to the burden which Jehovah bears.
