The language is taken from the custom of putting a ring or hook in the nose of a wild animal for the purpose of governing and guiding it. The most violent animals may be thus completely governed, and this is often done with those animals that are fierce and untameable. The Arabs often pursue this course in regard to the camel; and thus have it under entire control. A similar image is used in respect to the king of Egypt <a class=\"ref\">Ezekiel 29:4<\/a>. The idea is, that God would control and govern the wild and ambitious spirit of the Assyrian, and that with infinite ease he could conduct him again to his own land. <\/p> <p> <em>And my bridle <\/em>&mdash;(See the note at <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MjQ2XQ==\">Isaiah 30:28<\/a>). <\/p> <p> <em>And I will turn thee back <\/em>&mdash;(See <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MzkwXQ==\">Isaiah 37:37<\/a>). <\/p> ",
