The display was obviously something more than the ostentation of a Cr\u0153sus showing his treasures to Solon (Herod. i. 3). It was practically a display of the resources of the kingdom, intended to impress the Babylonian ambassadors with a sense of his importance as an ally.<\/p> \n<p>The spices, and the precious ointment . . .\u2014The mention of these articles as part of the king\u2019s treasures is characteristic of the commerce and civilisation of the time. \u201cSpices\u201d\u2014probably myrrh, gumbenzoin, cinnamon\u2014had from a very early period been among the gifts offered to princes (<a class=\"ref\">Genesis 43:11; 1 Kings 10:10<\/a>). The \u201cointment,\u201d or perfumed oil, finds its parallel in the costly unguent of the Gospel history (<a class=\"ref\">Matthew 26:7; John 12:3<\/a>). Esar-haddon\u2019s account of the magnificence of his palace (Records of the Past, iii., 122) supplies a contemporary instance of like ostentation.<\/p> ",
