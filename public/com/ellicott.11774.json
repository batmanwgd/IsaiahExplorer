(1) He (Jehovah) shall come like a rushing stream which the breath of Jehovah (i.e., a strong and mighty wind) driveth. (2) Adversity shall come like a stream. The verse is difficult, but the Authorised Version is, at least, as tenable as any other rendering, and finds parallelisms in <a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 46:7-8<\/a> for the image of a flood, and in <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 60:4<\/a> for that of the banner. (Comp.also <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 11:10<\/a>.)<\/p>",
