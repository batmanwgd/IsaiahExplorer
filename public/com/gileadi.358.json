    "html": "<p>Jehovah&rsquo;s condemnation of the world&rsquo;s evil rulers far exceeds that of the world&rsquo;s wicked in general. Foremost among these is the archtyrant, who descends into the Pit of Dissolution (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 14:15; 26:13-14; 51:13-14<\/a>). The Hell the evil rulers inherit compares to a fire burning endlessly: &ldquo;They shall go out and look upon the corpses of the people who transgressed against me, whose worms do not die and whose fire shall not be extinguished. They shall be a horror to all flesh&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 66:24<\/a>). Such a place was &ldquo;prepared of old,&rdquo; signifying its parallel creation with the earth itself (cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 25:1; 37:26<\/a>).<\/p>",
