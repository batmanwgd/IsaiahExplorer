    "html": " <i>wolf\/leopard\/lion\/lamb\/kid\/calf.<\/i> Six animals are listed (not counting the fatling, see below); three are wild carnivores (<i>wolf, leopard, lion<\/i>) that feed on the three tame animals (<i>lamb, kid, calf<\/i>). The wild animals, which are ferocious, aggressive, and vicious, are a threat to mankind; the tame animals are docile, submissive, and useful to man. This passage may be taken literally; or the wolf, leopard, and lion may represent those who foment war and murder; the lamb, kid, and calf may symbolize meek and peaceful people.<\/p> <p><i>fatling.<\/i> The King James Version translation of <i>fatling<\/i> is probably incorrect. The Jerusalem Bible suggests \"calf and lion cub feed together,\" replacing <i>fatling<\/i> with the verb <i>feed.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>little child shall lead them.<\/i> Small children will not only feel safe among the ferocious beasts but will have control over them and lead them.<\/p> ",
