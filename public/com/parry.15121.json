There they will wait, with full remembrance of their sins and without the knowledge necessary to free themselves from those sins until they are visited by the Lord's messengers, who can teach them the principles needed for their salvation.<\/p> <p><i>pit\/prison.<\/i> These terms refer to spirit prison (14:15, 19; <a class=\"ref\">Rev. 19:19-20<\/a>:3 <\/p> <p> <i>shall they be visited.<\/i> Isaiah assures us that the dead who have been gathered together as prisoners in a pit will be visited after many days. Just as Christ's ministers visited those in spirit prison to \"proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound\" (61:1; <a class=\"ref\">John 5:25<\/a>), and to \"bring out the prisoners from the prison, and them that sit in darkness out of the prison house\" (42:7), so too will \"we find that God will deal with all the human family equally, and&hellip;those characters referred to by Isaiah [will] have their time of visitation and deliverance; after having been many days in prison.\" Elder Orson Pratt taught that they will have the opportunity to be redeemed from their prison through the preaching of the gospel in the spirit world and through the performance of vicarious ordinances in mortality. <\/p> ",
