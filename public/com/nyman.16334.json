    "html": "          <p>President Harold B. Lee cited this passage in explaining the need for strong central authority in the Church to organize means to help the weak and provide for emergencies (see CR, Oct. 1971, p. 58). <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzcyNCI6OX0=\">Isaiah 3:16-24<\/a>.The term \"daughter of Zion\" probably has more than one meaning, and must be interpreted in context each time it occurs in the scriptures. President Joseph Fielding Smith interprets the dress styles of our modern day as a fulfillment of Isaiah's prophecy (AQ, 5:172-74). The dictionary definitions of \"haughty,\" \"wanton,\" and \"mincing\" suggest that Isaiah could easily have been referring to the inhabitants of the Americas, the Zion spoken of by the Old Testament prophets. The haughty are defined as those who are proud of self and scornful of others. Wanton is defined as undisciplined, unmanageable, lewd. Mincing is defined as short. feminine steps or as plain speech. These definitions could apply to the attitudes and practices of many inhabitants of the Americas.<\/p>     <p>Many of the words in verses 18 through 23 may refer to religious garb of modern-day sectarians. These verses were designated in the chapter outline as a description of the religious conditions of Zion, and verses 16 and 17 as a description of the social conditions. These conclusions are based on the uses of those words according to modern dictionaries.<\/p>     ",
