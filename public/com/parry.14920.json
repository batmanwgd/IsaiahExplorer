Lucifer, therefore, will never enter heaven. The irony here is that Lucifer received the opposite of his desire\u2014 instead of <i>ascending<\/i> into heaven, he fell, or was \"cut down to the ground\" (14:12).<\/p> <p><i>I will be like the Most High.<\/i> The title <i>Most High<\/i> indicates a vertical hierarchy: God is higher than all; he is the Most High. Lucifer desired to be like the Most High, but he has been cast down to hell (14:9, 11, 12, 15).<\/p> ",
