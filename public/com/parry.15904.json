The meaning is clearer if the lines are rearranged, which may have been the order in Isaiah's original:<\/p> <p>For stones I will bring iron,<\/p> <p>and for iron I will bring silver,<\/p> <p>and for wood brass,<\/p> <p>and for brass gold.<\/p> <p><i>make thy officers peace\/thine exactors righteousness.<\/i> In the past, Israel had been ruled by external authority in the form of foreign overseers and cruel taskmasters (exactors). But under Jehovah's millennial reign, peace will govern and righteousness will rule. For Zion's inhabitants, worldly evil and oppression will be replaced by inward peace and purity (32:16).<\/p> ",
