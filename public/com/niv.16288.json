Both stanzas contain references to the fact that the nations will restore Zion\u2019s scattered children.<\/p>     <p>\u2003In 60:4\u20139 Isaiah emphasizes the worldwide nature of the pilgrimage of the nations, coming from the far southeast (\u201cSheba\u201d) and from the distant west (\u201cTarshish\u201d). They will come with every kind of conveyance, from camels to ships. The wealth will be of every sort as well: incense, flocks, rams, silver, and gold. But there is no question what this wealth is intended to honor, for it is \u201cproclaiming the praise of the L<small>ORD<\/small>\u201d (60:6), it is \u201cto the honor of the L<small>ORD<\/small> your God\u201d (60:9). It is neither to praise nor to honor Zion, for Zion is only the lamp from which the light shines. To be sure, if it were not for the lamp, there would be no vehicle out of which the light could shine, because God has chosen to reveal himself in the context of human life. So the \u201csplendor\u201d with which he endows his people is an expression of his own generous abundance, but even more it is so that the world may know him.<\/p>     <p>\u2003Along with their wealth, the nations will also bring back Zion\u2019s \u201csons\u201d and \u201cdaughters\u201d (60:4, 9). This figure of speech pictures Zion as a bereaved wife and mother. What she thought was gone forever God will restore. He is able to make his people productive and fruitful again in every area of their lives. Note also the restoration to Israel of her scattered people. If the promises to Abraham are to have any meaning, the forced dispersion of Abraham\u2019s descendants cannot be permitted. In a coming day, all those who wished to return will be able to do so; moreover, the nations that carried them off will be the ones to bring them home (60:4, 9).<\/p>     ",
