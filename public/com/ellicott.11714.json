The courtiers of Manasseh would taunt them as aliens, and in the second case would press the letter of <a class=\"ref\">Deuteronomy 23:2<\/a>. The principle of Isaiah\u2019s teaching was, of course, applicable to the Israelites who, like Daniel and his friends, had been mutilated against their will by heathen conquerors ( <a class=\"ref\">Daniel 1:3<\/a>), and most commentators refer the words to such cases. It is scarcely probable, however, that the household of Hezekiah would have been supplied with home-born eunuchs, and, on the hypothesis which I have adopted, I find in the eunuchs a sub-section of the proselytes. The words put into the mouths of the complainers are the natural utterances of men treated as they had been.<\/p> ",
