This is usually of a much longer shape and darker complexion than the <span class=\"translit\">kermez<\/span>, hanging and ripening upon the tree even after the leaves are shed; and, provided the winter proves mild and temperate, is gathered as a delicious morsel in the spring; \"Shaw, Travels, p. 370, fol. The image was very obvious to the inhabitants of Judea and the neighboring countries, and is frequently applied by the prophets to express a desirable object; by none more elegantly than by  <a class=\"ref\">Hosea 9:10<\/a>; : - <\/p>\n\n<p>   \"Like grapes in the wilderness I found Israel;<\/p>\n\n<p>   Like the first ripe fig in her prime, I saw your fathers.\"<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Which when he that looketh upon it seeth \"Which whoso seeth, he plucketh it immediately\"\u2014<\/em>For <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d9\u05e8\u05d0\u05d4 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">yireh<\/span>, which with <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d4\u05e8\u05d0\u05d4 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">haroeh<\/span>  makes a miserable tautology, read, by a transposition of a letter, <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d9\u05d0\u05e8\u05d4 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">yoreh<\/span> ; a happy conjecture of Houbigant. The image expresses in the strongest manner the great ease with which the Assyrians shall take the city and the whole kingdom, and the avidity with which they shall seize the rich prey without resistance.<\/p>",
