    "html": " <p> <i>I reckoned till the dawn. <\/i> Others translate it \u201cI determined,\u201d or \u201cI laid down.\u201d Here it means what we express by the ordinary phrase, <i>(Je fasoye mon compte,)\u201d <\/i> I laid my account.\u201d From this verse it may be inferred that Hezekiah labored two days at least under the disease; for in the preceding verse he pronounced its severity to be so great that he expected immediate death. And now, when one day was past, he still waited <i>till the dawn, <\/i> and again, <i>from day even to night, <\/i> so that he said that he would die every moment. The meaning therefore is, that though he reached \u201cthe dawn,\u201d still through constant tossings he was hastening to death, because, having been struck by a terrible judgment of God, he cared nothing about his life; and as the Greeks, when they intended to say that nothing is more vain than man, said that he was (<span class=\"greek-hebrew\"> \u1f10\u03c6\u1f75\u03bc\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd <\/span>) \u201can <i>ephemeral <\/i> animal,\u201d that is, \u201cthe creature of a day,\u201d so Hezekiah means by \u201cthe life of a day\u201d that which is fading and has no duration. <\/p> \n <p> <i>As a lion, so hath he broken my bones. <\/i> The comparison of God to <i>a lion <\/i> ought not to be reckoned strange, though God is naturally \u201cgracious, merciful, and kind.\u201d (<a class=\"ref\">Exodus 34:6 <\/a>.) Nothing certainly can more truly belong to God than these attributes; but we cannot be aware of that gentleness, when we have provoked him by our crimes and urged him to severity by our wickedness. Besides, there is no cruelty and fierceness in wild beasts that is fitted to strike such terror as we feel from the bare mention of the name of God, and justly; for the Lord\u2019s chastisements must have sufficient power to humble and cast us down to hell itself, so that we shall be almost destitute of consolation and regard everything as full of horror. In like manner also, we see that David has described these terrors, when he says that \u201chis bones are numbered, his couch is moistened with tears, his soul is troubled, and hell is opened.\u201d (<a class=\"ref\">Psalms 6:3 <\/a>.) Thus must the godly be sometimes terrified by the judgment of God, that they may be more powerfully excited to desire his favor. <\/p> ",
