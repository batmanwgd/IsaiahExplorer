Sacred music invites the Spirit of the Lord into our midst and is a wonderful way in which to worship Deity. Modern revelation reminds us that the Lord's \"soul delighteth in the song of the heart; yea, the song of the righteous is a prayer unto [Him].\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 25:12<\/a>.)<\/p>",
