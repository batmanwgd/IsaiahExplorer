    "html": "<p>The Messiah is referred to in the scriptures as a &ldquo;stone&rdquo; (see<a class=\"ref\">Genesis 49:24; Psalm 118:22<\/a>) and also as a &ldquo;rock&rdquo; (see<a class=\"ref\">Deuteronomy 32:4, 15; 1 Samuel 2:2<\/a>). The prophet here uses this expression to describe the rejection of the Savior, the stumbling and offence, by the unbelieving of Israel and Judah. The New Testament writers also cited this passage in showing how the Jews for the most part rejected the Savior (see<a class=\"ref\">Romans 9:33; 1 Peter 2:8<\/a>).<\/p><p class=\"cite\"> LDS Church Educational System Old Testament Student Manual, 1 Kings&ndash;Malachi, Religion 302, Chapter 13, Item 49<\/p> ",
