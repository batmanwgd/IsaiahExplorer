The sentence is abrupt without it, the verb wanting its object; and I think it is genuine. Our English translation has supplied the word it, which is equivalent to this addition, from the Septuagint.<\/p>\n\n<p>This omission in the Hebrew text is ancient, being prior to the Chaldee, Syriac, and Vulgate Versions: but the words stand in all the copies of the Septuagint, and they are acknowledged by Luke,  <a class=\"ref\">Luke 3:6<\/a>. The whole of this verse is wanting in one of my oldest MSS.<\/p>",
