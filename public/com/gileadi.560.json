    "html": "<p>Keeping Jehovah&rsquo;s commandments&mdash;the law of his covenant&mdash;defines righteousness by Jehovah&rsquo;s standard ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODUwMl0seyIxODY3OCI6Mn0sWzE4NjgxXV0=\">Isaiah 42:21; 51:4-5, 7<\/a>) and begets peace ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgxMzMiOjJ9LFsxODc2OF1d\">Isaiah 26:2-3; 57:2<\/a>). Righteousness, moreover&mdash;as a spiritual attribute and as Jehovah&rsquo;s servant personifies it ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgxMzgiOjR9LFsxODQ1NF1d\">Isaiah 26:7-10; 41:2<\/a>)&mdash;begets salvation ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg1OTkiOjJ9LFsxODc1NV1d\">Isaiah 46:12-13; 56:1<\/a>), which is itself synonymous with peace ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTMyLDE4MTM0LDE4NzA0XQ==\">Isaiah 26:1, 3; 52:7<\/a>). Peace, in turn, implies an absence of the power of chaos<em>Sea<\/em> and<em>River<\/em> , which the archtyrant personifies ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxNzc3MF0seyIxNzgxNSI6Mn1d\">Isaiah 5:30; 8:7-8<\/a>) but which Jehovah subdues when his people keep the terms of his covenant ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODI3LDE4OTM1XQ==\">Isaiah 60:5; 66:12<\/a>).<\/p><p>As Abraham exemplified righteousness ( <a class=\"ref\">Genesis 15:6<\/a>), and as Jehovah promised him offspring as many as the sands of the sea ( <a class=\"ref\">Genesis 22:17<\/a>), so he promises the same to those whose righteousness compares with Abraham&rsquo;s. The alternative to covenant blessings, however, are covenant curses. Instead of receiving &ldquo;an everlasting name that shall not be cut off&rdquo; ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzU5XQ==\">Isaiah 56:5<\/a>; cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODU3LDE4OTQ1XQ==\">62:2; 66:22<\/a>), the names of Jehovah&rsquo;s unrepentant people and their offspring<em>are<\/em> &ldquo;cut off&rdquo;&mdash;that is, excluded from his covenant people and included in the Greater Babylon category that is damned ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3OTUxLDE4ODg2LDE4OTEzXQ==\">Isaiah 14:22; 63:19; 65:15<\/a>).<\/p> ",
