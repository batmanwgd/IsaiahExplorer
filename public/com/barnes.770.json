    "html": "<p><em>Thy silver<\/em>&mdash;The sentiment in this verse, as it is explained by the following, is, thy princes and people have become corrupt, and polluted. Silver is used here to denote what should have been more valuable&mdash;virtuous princes.<\/p><p><em>Dross<\/em>&mdash;This word&mdash;\u05e1\u05d9\u05d2 s\u0131\u0302g&mdash;means the scoriae, or baser metal, which is separated from the purer in smelting. It is of little or no value; and the expression means, that the rulers had become debased and corrupt, as if pure silver had been converted wholly to dross.<\/p><p><em>Thy wine<\/em>&mdash;Wine was regarded as the most pure and valuable drink among the ancients. It is used, therefore, to express that which should have been most valued and esteemed among them&mdash;to wit, their rulers.<\/p><p><em>Mixed with water<\/em>&mdash;Diluted, made weak. According to Gesenius, the word rendered &ldquo;mixed&rdquo;&mdash;\u05de\u05d4\u05d5\u05bc\u05dc ma\u0302hu\u0302l&mdash;is from \u05de\u05d4\u05dc ma\u0302hal, the same as \u05de\u05d5\u05bc\u05dc mu\u0302l, to circumcise; and hence, by a figure common with the Arabians, to adulterate, or dilute wine. The word does not occur in this sense elsewhere in the Scriptures, but the connection evidently requires it to be so understood. Wine mixed with water is that which is weakened, diluted, rendered comparatively useless. So with the rulers and judges. They had lest the strength and purity of their integrity, by intermingling those things which tended to weaken and destroy their virtue, pride, the love of gifts, and bribes, etc. Divested of the figure, the passage means, that the rulers had become wholly corrupt.<\/p> ",
