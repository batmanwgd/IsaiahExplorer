<h4>Original Meaning<\/h4>                   <p>T<small>HESE VERSES<\/small> (the second part of 44:23\u201346:13) sum up the case for God\u2019s superiority over the idols. The first segment (45:14\u201325) contrasts God\u2019s ability to save with that of the idols in a general way. The second (46:1\u20137) continues this contrast in much more concrete imagery. In both of these the theme of \u201ccarrying\u201d is prominent. In the final section (46:8\u201313), Isaiah calls on his hearers to take all this to heart and not to give up hope that God will deliver them.<\/p>     ",
