    "html": "<p>This chapter focuses on the punishments to be poured out on the wicked and rebellious of Judah and Jerusalem. In fact, only once is an optimistic note of hope found: verse 10 of the Nephite text proclaims, \"Say unto the righteous that it is well with them.\"<\/p>     <p>Rebellious Judah will suffer physically, spiritually, politically, and socially. Every means of support upon which she relies will be threatened or taken away from her. There are undoubtedly multiple fulfillments of these prophecies, for Jerusalem and the people of Judah were frequently the target of oppressors and aggressors, as was the rest of the house of Israel.<\/p>     <p>The \"daughters of Zion\" are particularly criticized by the prophet for their reliance on the ways of the world. Latter-day leaders of the Lord's church have occasionally applied these verses to vain women of our days who get caught up with worldly fashions and ways.<\/p>     <p>The chapter closes with a description of the woes that will befall the people as a whole.<\/p>     <p>This chapter of Isaiah should be read in conjunction with the previous and following chapters in order to get the \"big picture.\" While being filled with warnings to the \"proud and lofty,\" <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzEwXQ==\">Isaiah 2<\/a> contains a great deal of hope. Chapter 3, however, presents the down side; focusing on judgments to be poured out on the rebellious. Finally, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzEyXQ==\">Isaiah 4<\/a> provides the hope of a future redemption for Zion and Jerusalem.<\/p>",
