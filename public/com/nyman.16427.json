    "html": "          <p>The KJV \"Woe to the land\" is translated \"Ah land of\" in the RSV. Commentators also suggest that Lo, Alas, Hark, or Hail could be accurate, and they are almost unanimous in thinking that this is not a message of doom but of hope. Hyrum Smith said in April 1844, \"The gathering will continue here [Nauvoo, Illinois] until the Temple is so far finished that the Elders can get their endowments; and after that the gathering will be from the nations to North and South America, which is the land of Zion. <i>North and<\/i> South <i>America, are the symbols of the<\/i> wings.\" (HC, 6:322; italics added.) Elder Orson Pratt also identified the land of North and South America as the land spoken of in this verse, and he emphasized that the ensign mentioned in verse 3 was to go to all the world (see JD, 16:84-85). President Joseph Fielding Smith confirmed that \"the land shadowing with wings\" was America (see CR, Apr. 1966, p. 14); on another occasion he stated that the term \"vessels of bulrushes\" in verse 2 should read \"vessels of speed,\" and that the \"nation scattered and peeled\" is Palestine. The <i>land<\/i> of Palestine was denuded or \"peeled\" of its forests under Turkish misrule. The ensign's being lifted up refers to the restoration of the gospel in America; ambassadors would then go from America to the nations of the earth to gather those people who are \"scattered and peeled.\" (See ST, pp. 51-55.)<\/p>     ",
