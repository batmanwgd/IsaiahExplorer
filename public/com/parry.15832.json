    "html": " <p>After condemning the wicked, the Lord now gives promises of blessings to the faithful:<\/p> <p>If they put their trust in God, they will \"possess the land\" (57:13), meaning the land of their inheritance.<\/p> <p>They will be gathered to Zion without stumbling blocks to hinder them (57:14).<\/p> <p>If they are humble and contrite, the Lord will revive their flagging spirits and troubled hearts (57:15).<\/p> <p>The Lord will remove his wrath from them (57:16).<\/p> <p>The Lord will heal them (57:18, 19).<\/p> <p>The Lord will lead them down life's paths (57:18).<\/p> <p>The Lord will comfort them (57:18).<\/p> <p>The Lord will give them peace, whether they are physically near or far (57:19).<\/p> <p>The wicked, of course, receive no such promises. Instead, they are assured that they will have no peace but will be like troubled waters that cannot rest. Waters in constant motion continually stir up dirt and mire, and the wicked do the same (57:20- 21).<\/p> <blockquote> but he that putteth his trust in me <i>shall possess<\/i> <u>the land<\/u><i>,<\/i>     <br>and <i>shall<\/i> <i>inherit<\/i> <u>my holy mountain<\/u>; (57:13b)     <br>And shall say, <i>Cast<\/i> <i>ye<\/i> <u>up<\/u>,     <br><i>cast ye<\/i> <u>up<\/u>,     <br><i>prepare<\/i> the <u>way<\/u>,     <br><i>take up the stumblingblock<\/i> out of the <u>way<\/u> of my people.

(57:15)     <br>For <i>I <\/i> <u>will not contend for ever<\/u>,     <br><u>neither will<\/u> <i>I <\/i> <u>be always wroth<\/u>:     <br>for the <i>spirit<\/i> should fail before <u>me<\/u>,     <br>and the <i>souls<\/i> which <u>I <\/u> have made.

(57:18)     <br>I create the fruit of the lips;     <br><i>Peace, peace to him<\/i> <u>that is far off<\/u>,     <br>and <i>to him<\/i> <u>that is near<\/u>, saith the Lord;     <br>and I will heal him. (57:19)     <br>But the wicked are like the <u>troubled<\/u> <i>sea,<\/i>     <br>when <i>it<\/i> <u>cannot rest<\/u>, whose <i>waters<\/i> <u>cast up mire and dirt<\/u>. (57:20)     <br>There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked. (57:21)<\/blockquote> ",
