    "html": "<p> This general law of His action is most especially the law of His conduct towards Israel, in which such grievous effects of its well-deserved punishment are apparent, and effects so different from those intended, that the compassion of God feels impelled to put an end to the punishment for the good of all that are susceptible of salvation. <em> \u201cAnd because of the iniquity of its selfishness, I was wroth, and smote it; hiding myself, and being angry: then it went on, turning away in the way of its own heart. I have seen its ways, and will heal it; and will lead it, and afford consolations to it, and to its mourning ones.\u201d<\/em> The fundamental and chief sin of Israel is here called \u05d1\u05bc\u05e6\u05e2 , lit., a cut of slice (= gain, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzY1XQ==\">Isaiah 56:11<\/a>); then, like \u03c0\u03bb\u03b5\u03bf\u03bd\u03b5\u03be\u03b9\u0301\u03b1 , which is \u201cidolatry\u201d according to <a class=\"ref\">Colossians 3:5<\/a>, or like \u03c6\u03b9\u03bb\u03b1\u03c1\u03b3\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u0301\u03b1 , which is \u201cthe root of all evil\u201d according to <a class=\"ref\">1 Timothy 6:10<\/a>, greedy desire for worldly possession, self-seeking, or worldliness generally. The future \u05d5\u05d0\u05db\u05bc\u05d4\u05d5\u05bc , standing as it does by the side of the perfect here, indicates that which is also past; and \u05d5\u05d0\u05e7\u05e6\u05e3 stands in the place of a second gerund: <em> abscondendo <\/em> (viz., <em> pa\u0302nai <\/em> , my face, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzMyXQ==\">Isaiah 54:8<\/a>) <em> et stomachando <\/em> . When Jehovah had thus wrathfully hidden His gracious countenance from Israel, and withdrawn His gracious presence out of the midst of Israel (<a class=\"ref\">Hosea 5:6<\/a>, \u05de\u05d4\u05dd \u05d7\u05dc ), it went away from Him ( \u05e9\u05c1\u05d5\u05d1\u05d1 with \u05e9\u05c1\u05d5\u05d1\u05d1 , like \u05e2\u05d5\u05dc\u05dc with \u05e2\u05d5\u05dc\u05dc ), going its own ways like the world of nations that had been left to themselves. But Jehovah had not seen these wanderings without pity. The futures which follow are promising, not by virtue of any syntactic necessity, but by virtue of an inward necessity.
