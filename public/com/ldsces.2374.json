    "html": "<p><a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg0MjIiOjUyNn1d\">Isaiah 40&ndash;66<\/a>is prophetic. Although reference is made to Isaiah&rsquo;s immediate future, the burden of his prophecy is for the latter days. Most Bible scholars feel that these chapters are historical and that they were written by others after Judah was exiled to Babylon. Yet Book of Mormon prophets quote parts or all of <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg2MTYiOjEwOX1d\">Isaiah 48&ndash;53<\/a>, indicating these chapters must have been included on the Brass Plates before the Babylonian exile. Christ told the Nephites that Isaiah &ldquo;spake as touching all things concerning my people which are of the house of Israel; therefore it must needs be that he must speak also to the Gentiles&rdquo; (<a class=\"ref\">3 Nephi 23:2<\/a>). Isaiah&rsquo;s prophecies concerning Israel&rsquo;s destiny are more reliable than the limited perspective of historians.<\/p><p class=\"cite\">LDS Church Educational System Old Testament Student Manual, 1 Kings&ndash;Malachi, Religion 302, Chapter 16, Item 13<\/p>",
