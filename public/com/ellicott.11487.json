In the actual work of the Servant we find the fulfilment of his vision. Scribes and Pharisees are as those who \u201clearn nothing and forget nothing,\u201d on whom all the lessons of experience are cast away, reproducing the state from which Isaiah started (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzgwXQ==\">Isaiah 6:10<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\">Matthew 13:14; Mark 4:12; Luke 8:10; John 12:40; Acts 28:26<\/a>). The transfer of the words to the sufferings of the Christ, who bore them as though He neither heard nor saw, is scarcely tenable.<\/p>",
