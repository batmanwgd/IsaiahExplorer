As we must assume, according to <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDQxXQ==\">Isaiah 40:20<\/a>, that the prophet intends to carry us into the midst of the process of manufacturing the idol, the paratactic expression is to be pointed as above, viz., \u201cafter the (a) smith has cast it (compare Arab. <em> nasik <\/em> , a piece of cast metal), the (a) melter (goldsmith) covers it with gold plate;\u201d and <em> tso\u0304re\u0304ph <\/em> , which is palindromically repeated, according to Isaiah's custom, is not the third pers. <em> poel<\/em> (on the <em> poel<\/em> of strong stems, see at <a class=\"ref\">Job 9:15<\/a> and <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 109:10<\/a>), but a participle, equivalent to \u05d4\u05d5\u05bc\u05d0 \u05e6\u05d5\u05e8\u05e3 (as in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MjAyXQ==\">Isaiah 29:8<\/a>, which see; and also, according to the accents, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4Mjg1XQ==\">Isaiah 33:5<\/a>), \u201cand he melteth chains of silver,\u201d viz., to fasten the image.<\/p>",
