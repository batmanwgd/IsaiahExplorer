    "html": "<p>Isaiah presents new literary techniques and teaching patterns in this unusual chapter. Using a parable with a surprise ending, six snapshots of woeful human behavior, and a prophecy with a pleasant promise, he foreshadows the scattering of the children of Israel, recounts their multiple disappointments, and foretells their eventual gathering. This chapter divides easily into three sections: the parable of the vineyard (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzc0MSI6N30=\">vv. 1&ndash;7<\/a>), a series of six pronouncements upon wicked Israel (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzc0OCI6MTh9\">vv. 8&ndash;25<\/a>), and a promise of an ensign that will rally a great latter-day army (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzc2NiI6NX0=\">vv. 26&ndash;30<\/a>). In each of these sections, Isaiah follows a threefold pattern:<\/p>\r\n<p>1. Calling upon an audience and identifying their high hopes.<\/p>\r\n<p>2. Describing the Lord&rsquo;s dealings with them.<\/p>\r\n<p>3. Highlighting how the outcome of events is contrary to earlier expectations.<\/p>\r\n<p>This pattern of high expectation, clarification, and low fulfillment appears several times throughout the chapter.<\/p>",
