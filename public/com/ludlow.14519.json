    "title": "Isaiah&rsquo;s Entrapment Parable of the Vineyard",
    "html": " <p>Isaiah presents new literary techniques and teaching patterns in this unusual chapter. Using a parable with a surprise ending, six snapshots of woeful human behavior, and a prophecy with a pleasant promise, he foreshadows the scattering of the children of Israel, recounts their multiple disappointments, and foretells their eventual gathering. This chapter divides easily into three sections: the parable of the vineyard (vv. 1&ndash;7), a series of six pronouncements upon wicked Israel (vv. 8&ndash;25), and a promise of an ensign that will rally a great latter-day army (vv. 26&ndash;30). In each of these sections, Isaiah follows a threefold pattern:<\/p> <p>1. Calling upon an audience and identifying their high hopes.<\/p> <p>2. Describing the Lord&rsquo;s dealings with them.<\/p> <p>3. Highlighting how the outcome of events is contrary to earlier expectations.<\/p> <p>This pattern of high expectation, clarification, and low fulfillment appears several times throughout the chapter.<\/p> ",
