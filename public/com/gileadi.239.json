As much of the land is destroyed from within, Egypt&rsquo;s enemies see their chance to invade from without. When Jehovah withdraws his Spirit because of a people&rsquo;s evildoing, they are left to their own devices. Their alienation causes Jehovah to close the heavens. They lose the light they once had, and a man&rsquo;s adversaries become those of his own people. Desperate, they turn to false channels of information&mdash;idols, spiritists, mediums, and witchcraft&mdash;only to compound their plight (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 8:19-20; 42:17; 44:17; 45:20<\/a>).<\/p>",
