As precious stones signify higher spiritual categories of people ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODY1NCI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 49:17-18<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\">Malachi 3:16-17<\/a>), the idea of promised lands adorned with gemstones additionally implies that those who live into the millennial age have ascended to higher spiritual levels. Prominent among these is Jehovah&rsquo;s servant, whose task is to restore Jehovah&rsquo;s people even beyond their former glory: &ldquo;I lay in Zion a stone, a keystone, a precious cornerstone, a sure foundation&rdquo; ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTgxXQ==\">Isaiah 28:16<\/a>).<\/p> ",
