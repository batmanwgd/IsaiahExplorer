The underlying thought is that the returning exiles would be the most acceptable offering that could be brought to Jehovah. The same idea appears in <a class=\"ref\">Zephaniah 3:10<\/a>, and a similar one, transferred, however, to the Gentile converts, in <a class=\"ref\">Romans 15:16<\/a>. <\/p>\n <p>Upon horses, and in chariots . . .\u2014The list of the modes of transport, as in <a class=\"ref\">Zechariah 14:15<\/a>, points to the various habits of the many nations who are to be sharers in the work. <\/p>\n <p>As the children of Israel . . .\u2014The \u201cclean offering\u201d is, as before, the minchah.
