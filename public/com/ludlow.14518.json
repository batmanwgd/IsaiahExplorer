    "html": " <p>In verses 5 and 6, Isaiah describes the sacred nature of the tabernacle, or temple, by calling it a &ldquo;shadow in the daytime,&rdquo; a &ldquo;place of refuge,&rdquo; and &ldquo;a covert from storm and from rain&rdquo; (v. 6.) These composite descriptions of latter-day temples illustrate the peace and security that come through temple attendance. Isaiah&rsquo;s allusions to a cloud of smoke and a pillar of fire evoke images of similar phenomena that followed the ancient children of Israel on their travels in the wilderness. The Holy of Holies, the Israelites&rsquo; sacred tabernacle (or temple), was continuously shadowed by smoke and fire as a sign of the Lord&rsquo;s protection. Thus, Isaiah promises that in the latter days, the righteous in their sacred places on mount Zion will be protected by the Lord&rsquo;s &ldquo;smoke&rdquo; and &ldquo;fire&rdquo; (v. 5). This does not refer only to the latter-day temples. As we are taught in latter-day doctrine, all aspects of our lives are like temples&mdash;our homes, our churches, and our bodies. As we live worthily, we receive God&rsquo;s guidance and protection.<\/p> <p>Instead of being like the weak, selfish men and the vain, worldly women described by Isaiah in 2 Nephi 13, we should be like the pure, holy children of Zion prophesied about in 2 Nephi 14. As we become clean and sanctified, we become vessels in which the Holy Spirit can continually dwell. With that Spirit, God will instruct and guide us, and with His might, He will shield and protect us.<\/p> ",
