They shall come to Ephraim, who will bless them with \"the blessing of the everlasting God.\" This will be preceded, of course, by Ephraim's gathering in preparation for the other tribes to come (see <a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 45:71; 66:11; 101:18<\/a>). The Prophet Joseph Smith said that verse 10 referred to the Zion on the American continent, unto which the ransomed of the Lord would return (see TPJS, pp. 17, 34). President David O. McKay cited verse 8 as evidence that the scriptures are so simple that \"wayfaring men, though fools,\" could understand them (see CR, Oct. 1966, p. 137).<\/p>     <p>There is a clarifying change in the Joseph Smith Translation which corresponds with <a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 133:26-34<\/a>.<\/p>     <table>         <tbody>             <tr>                 <td>And an highway shall be there, and a way, and it shall be called The way of holiness; the unclean shall not pass over it; but it shall be for those: the wayfaring men, though fools, shall not err therein.
