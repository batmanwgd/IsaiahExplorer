It seems, however, by many of the expressions which the prophet uses, that he is rather giving a description of the corrupt state of the Jewish Church, before the destruction of Jerusalem by the Chaldeans. <i>Draw near hither <\/i>\u2014 To God\u2019s tribunal, to receive your sentence; <i>ye sons of the sorceress <\/i>\u2014 Not by propagation, but by imitation, those being frequently called men\u2019s sons that follow their example: <i>the seed of the adulterer, <\/i>&c. \u2014 Not the genuine children of Abraham, as you pretend and boast yourselves to be; your dispositions being far more suitable to a spurious brood than to Abraham\u2019s seed. <i>Against whom do you sport yourselves? <\/i>\u2014 Consider who it is that you mock and scoff at when you deride God\u2019s prophets, (see <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTc5XQ==\">Isaiah 28:14<\/a>; <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTg3XQ==\">Isaiah 28:22<\/a>,) and know that it is not so much men that you insult, as God, whose cause they plead, and in whose name they speak. <i>Are ye not a seed of falsehood <\/i>\u2014 A generation of liars, whose practices contradict your professions, who deal deceitfully both with God and man?<\/p>",
