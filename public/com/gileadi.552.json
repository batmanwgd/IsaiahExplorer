Where such prophecy is lacking (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgyMDMiOjJ9LHsiMTg0NzQiOjN9LFsxODQ3OF1d\">Isaiah 29:9-10; 41:22-24, 26<\/a>), his Spirit has withdrawn because of wickedness. At that point people are prone to take matters into their own hands instead of turning to Jehovah (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc4MzkiOjJ9LHsiMTc5OTIiOjR9XQ==\">Isaiah 9:9-10; 17:8-11<\/a>). Where ancient prophecies came to pass, it was a sign they were of God, not of man. Where prophecies apply to both the past and the end-time, as do Isaiah&rsquo;s, their future fulfillment is assured based on past results. Jehovah&rsquo;s servant&mdash;his<em>mouth<\/em> &mdash;conforms to that divine pattern.<\/p> ",
