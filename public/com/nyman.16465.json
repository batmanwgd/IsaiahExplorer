The effects of the book's coming forth are then described by Isaiah: the deaf shall hear, the blind shall see, and the meek and the poor shall rejoice in the Lord. Elder Mark E. Petersen related this to the spiritual force which would attend the book, and its remarkable effect on those who would read it (see CR, Oct. 1965, p. 61). Elder Orson Pratt saw a literal fulfillment of Isaiah's prophecy in the physically deaf being restored to hearing: \"Those who were so deaf that they could not hear the loudest sound, have had their ears opened to hear the glorious and most precious words of the Book of Mormon, and it has been done by the power of God and not of man\" (Works, p. 277). And Elder LeGrand Richards has given a further application of this passage by noting that the Book of Mormon has been printed in braille so that the physically blind would be able to know its message (see CR, Apr. 1976, p. 124).<\/p>     ",
