Three key phrases point out the disaster that awaits the multitudes who \"spoil us\" and \"rob us\": They are \"God shall rebuke them,\" \"they shall flee far off,\" and \"they shall be chased\"<i> <\/i>(17:13)<i>.<\/i><\/p> <blockquote>Woe to the multitude of <i>many people,<\/i> which <u>make a noise like the noise of the seas<\/u>;     <br>and to the rushing of <i>nations,<\/i> that <u>make a rushing like the rushing of mighty waters<\/u>! (17:12)     <br>The nations shall rush like the rushing of many waters: but God shall rebuke them,     <br>and they shall flee far off,     <br>and shall be chased     <br><i>as the chaff<\/i> of the mountains <u>before the wind<\/u>,     <br>and <i>like a rolling thing<\/i> <u>before the whirlwind<\/u>.
