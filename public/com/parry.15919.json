But in the last days, God's people not only will have their lost blessings restored to them but their blessings will be doubled. In ancient Jewish law, the double portion was allotted to the firstborn, thus indicating that restored Israel is in a favored position (<a class=\"ref\">Deut. 21:17<\/a>). <\/p> <p><i>everlasting joy.<\/i> The inheritance of the faithful is never to be taken away again. Instead, they will have eternal <i>joy<\/i> in Christ (35:10; 51:11; <a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 45:71; Moses 7:53<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\">Rom. 5:11<\/a>). <\/p> ",
