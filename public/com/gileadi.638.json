    "html": "<p>Because Israel&rsquo;s God is no respecter of persons (<a class=\"ref\">2 Chronicles 19:7; Acts 10:34; Romans 2:11<\/a>), foreigners and eunuchs&mdash;who comprise the lowest rung of society&mdash;needn&rsquo;t suppose that even if they keep the terms of Jehovah&rsquo;s covenant he still won&rsquo;t acknowledge them as his people. Their keeping the Sabbath Day holy and &ldquo;choosing to do what I will&rdquo; are the essence of covenant keeping and make them as acceptable to him as his people who are natural-born. Not only does he bless them with the blessings of his covenant as he does them (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc2NjIiOjF9XQ==\">v 7<\/a>), but they may ascend to the highest spiritual categories.<\/p><p>Jehovah&rsquo;s giving the righteous aliens among his people &ldquo;a handclasp and a name&rdquo; in his temple &ldquo;that is better than sons and daughters&rdquo; betokens the assurance of an eternal posterity beyond this life. As the promise of a name is inseparable from that of offspring (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc5NTEiOjF9LHsiMTg2MzQiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 14:22; 48:19<\/a>), Jehovah makes this promise with all whom he clasps by the hand and gives a new name in the pattern of an emperor to a vassal who proves loyal to him (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg0NDciOjF9LHsiMTg1NjMiOjR9XQ==\">Isaiah 40:26; 45:1-4<\/a>): &ldquo;&lsquo;As the new heavens and the new earth which I make shall endure before me,&rsquo; says Jehovah, &lsquo;so shall your offspring and name endure&rsquo;&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg5NDUiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 66:22<\/a>).<\/p><p>While types from the past possess real historical roots, for them to fully typify an end-time scenario requires linking up such types with others within their larger end-time context. Those who hold fast to Jehovah&rsquo;s <em>covenant<\/em>&mdash;his servant (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg0ODciOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 42:6<\/a>)&mdash;for example, are also those who come to Jehovah&rsquo;s <em>light<\/em> (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg4MjUiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 60:3<\/a>), who inquire at his <em>mouth<\/em> (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgyMjAiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 30:2<\/a>), who hear his <em>voice<\/em> (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgxODgiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 28:23<\/a>), who rally to his <em>ensign<\/em> (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc4OTUiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 11:10<\/a>), who know <em>righteousness<\/em> (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg2NzUiOjJ9XQ==\">Isaiah 51:1, 7<\/a>), who receive an inheritance from his <em>hand<\/em> (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgzMjEiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 34:17<\/a>)&mdash;all of which terms are metaphorical pseudonyms of Jehovah&rsquo;s servant.<\/p>",
