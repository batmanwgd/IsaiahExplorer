    "html": "<p>The terms &ldquo;smith&rdquo; and &ldquo;ravager&rdquo; identify the king of Assyria\/Babylon, who ravages and desolates the earth: &ldquo;His purpose shall be to annihilate and to exterminate nations not a few&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc4NTgiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 10:7<\/a>; cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc4NDgiOjJ9LHsiMTc5MTYiOjV9LHsiMTc5NDUiOjJ9LHsiMTgyODEiOjF9XQ==\">9:18-19; 13:9-13; 14:16-17; 33:1<\/a>). Jehovah empowers him to destroy the wicked of his people and the nations in his Day of Judgment: &ldquo;Have you not heard how I ordained this thing long ago, how in days of old I planned it? Now I have brought it to pass. You were destined to demolish fortified cities, [turning them] into heaps of rubble&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgzNzkiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 37:26<\/a>; cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc3NjUiOjZ9LHsiMTc4NTYiOjJ9LHsiMTc5MTEiOjJ9LHsiMTgxNjciOjR9XQ==\">5:25-30; 10:5-6; 13:4-5; 28:2-3, 21-22<\/a>).<\/p><p>A third chief covenant blessing (cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc3NDEiOjN9XQ==\">vv 1-3<\/a>)&mdash;divine protection&mdash;comes when Jehovah&rsquo;s people and their proxy saviors keep the terms of his covenants (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgzODgiOjF9LHsiMTg0NjIiOjR9LHsiMTg2MzMiOjF9LHsiMTg4ODQiOjF9LHsiMTg5MDYiOjJ9XQ==\">Isaiah 37:35; 41:10-13; 48:18; 63:17; 65:8-9<\/a>). Even when &ldquo;wickedness is set ablaze like a fire&rdquo; and &ldquo;forests&rdquo; or cities &ldquo;billow upward in mushrooming clouds of smoke&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc4NDgiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 9:18<\/a>), when &ldquo;whole nations have been burned like lime, mown down like thorns and set ablaze&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgyOTIiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 33:12<\/a>), Jehovah provides a way for his people to &ldquo;live through the devouring fire&rdquo; on account of their justice and righteousness (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgyOTQiOjJ9XQ==\">Isaiah 33:14-15<\/a>; cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc2ODIiOjF9LHsiMTgyNzciOjF9LHsiMTg1MDgiOjF9LHsiMTg3OTUiOjF9XQ==\">1:27; 32:17; 43:2; 58:8<\/a>).<\/p><p>Essential to his people&rsquo;s end-time preservation is the role of Jehovah&rsquo;s servant, their proxy savior who assures their &ldquo;vindication&rdquo; or &ldquo;righteousness&rdquo; (<em>sidqatam<\/em>) (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg3MjMiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 53:11<\/a>), and the role of other servants who similarly serve as proxy saviors under the terms of the Davidic Covenant (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg3NjAiOjF9LHsiMTg4ODQiOjF9LHsiMTg5MDYiOjR9LHsiMTg5MzciOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 56:6; 63:17; 65:8-9, 13-14; 66:14<\/a>). The empowerment of additional such servants&mdash;the &ldquo;followers of righteousness&rdquo; or those who &ldquo;know righteousness&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg2NzUiOjJ9XQ==\">Isaiah 51:1, 7<\/a>)&mdash;derives from the mission of Jehovah&rsquo;s servant (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg4NDciOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 61:3<\/a>). All these refute the <em>tongue<\/em>&mdash;the king of Assyria\/Babylon&mdash;and others like him.<\/p>",
