There, however, the sum represents the annual produce of the vineyard, here the rent of the vines at a shekel each, a high rent apparently, and indicating a choice quality of vine. The costly vineyards of the hills of Judah should be left to run wild without a keeper (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzUwXQ==\">Isaiah 5:10<\/a>), and thorns and briers would rapidly cover it. \u201cSilverling\u201d was an old English word for any silver coin, and appears in Tyndale\u2019s version of<a class=\"ref\">Acts 19:19<\/a> , and Coverdale\u2019s of<a class=\"ref\">Judges 9:4; Judges 16:5<\/a> ; here it stands for \u201cshekel.\u201d The modern rent is said to be a piastre (2\u00bcd.) for each vine; the shekel was worth 2s. 3 d. (Kay).<\/p> ",
