The breach\u2014Breach is put for breaches, which was made by God's judgment breaking in upon them in suffering the walls of their towns and cities to be demolished. Paths\u2014Those paths that led from city to city, which being now laid desolate, and uninhabited, were grown over with grass, and weeds. To dwell in\u2014These accommodations being recovered, their ancient cities might be fit to be re\u2014inhabited.",
