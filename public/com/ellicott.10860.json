    "html": "<p>The Lord shall bring upon thee . . .\u2014The prophet\u2019s language shows that he reads the secret thoughts of the king\u2019s heart. He was bent on calling in the help of the king of Assyria. Isaiah warns him (reserving the name of the king, with all the emphasis of suddenness, for the close of his sentence) that by so doing he is bringing on himself a more formidable invasion than that of Syria and Ephraim, worse than any that had been known since the separation of the two kingdoms (we note the use of the event as a chronological era), than that of Shishak under Rehoboam (<a class=\"ref\">2 Chronicles 12:2<\/a>), or Zerah (<a class=\"ref\">2 Chronicles 14:9<\/a>), or of Baasha under Asa (<a class=\"ref\">2 Chronicles 16:1<\/a>), or of the Moabites and Ammonites under Jehoshaphat (<a class=\"ref\">2 Chronicles 20:1<\/a>), or of the Philistines and Arabians under Jehoram (<a class=\"ref\">2 Chronicles 21:16<\/a>). So in <a class=\"ref\">2 Chronicles 28:19-20<\/a>, we read that \u201cthe Lord brought Judah low and made it naked,\u201d that \u201cTilgath-pilneser, king of Assyria, came unto Ahaz and distressed him,\u201d and this was but the precursor of the great invasions under Sargon and Sennacherib. <\/p>",
