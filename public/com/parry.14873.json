    "html": " <i>draw water\/wells of salvation.<\/i> A better translation for <i>wells of salvation<\/i> is \"springs of salvation,\" which depicts living, flowing water. Christ represents the <i>waters<\/i> of salvation (<a class=\"ref\">Jer. 2:13; 17:13<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\">Ether 8:26; 12:28<\/a>). The parallel between literal water and the waters of salvation is evident\u2014the first is essential for physical life, the second for eternal life. In part, the expression <i>wells of salvation<\/i> refers to the great privilege the righteous have to partake of the blessings connected with the First and Second Comforters (<a class=\"ref\">John 7:38-39; 14:16<\/a>) but more fully the expression pertains to those who will receive exaltation in the celestial kingdom and will drink eternally from the wells of salvation (<a class=\"ref\">Rev. 21:6<\/a>). <\/p> ",
