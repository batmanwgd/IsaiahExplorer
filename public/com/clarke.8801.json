    "html": "<p>This chapter first displays the fullness, freeness, excellence, and everlasting nature of the blessings of the Gospel, and foretells again the enlargement of Messiah's kingdom,  <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 55:1-5<\/a>. This view leads the prophet to exhort all to seize the precious opportunity of sharing in such blessings, which were not, however, to be expected without repentance and reformation,  <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 55:6<\/a>,  <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 55:7<\/a>. And as the things now and formerly predicted were so great as to appear incredible, the prophet points to the omnipotence of God, who would infallibly accomplish his word, and bring about those glorious deliverances which he had promised; the happy effects of which are again set forth by images beautiful and poetical in the highest degree,  <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 55:8-13<\/a>.<\/p>",
