    "html": " <p> <i>But yet... <\/i>,\u2014The main idea in this verse is plain, though there is much difficulty in the explanation of the particular phrases. The leading thought is, that the land should not be \u201cutterly\u201d and finally abandoned. There would be the remains of life\u2014as in an oak or terebinth tree when the tree has fallen; compare the notes at <a class='isa' seq='0'>,Isaiah 11:1 <\/a>. <\/p> <p> <i>A tenth <\/i>,\u2014That is, a tenth of the inhabitants, or a very small part. Amidst the general desolation, a small part should be preserved. This was accomplished in the time of the captivity of the Jews by Nebuchadnezzar. We are not to suppose that \u201cliterally\u201d a tenth part of the nation would remain; but a part that should bear somewhat the same proportion to the entire nation, in strength and resources, that a tenth does to the whole. Accordingly, in the captivity by the Babylonians we are told <a class='ref'>,2 Kings 25:12 <\/a>,, that \u2018the captain of the guard left the poor of the land to be vinedressers and farmers;\u2019 compare <a class='ref'>,2 Kings 24:14 <\/a>,, where it is said, that \u2018Nebuchadnezzar carried away all Jerusalem, and all the princes, and all the mighty men of valor, even ten thousand captives, and all the craftsmen and smiths, none remained save the poorer sort of the people of the land.\u2019 Over this remnant, Nebuchadnezzar made Gedaliah king; <a class='ref'>,2 Kings 25:22 <\/a>. <p> <i>And it shall return <\/i>,\u2014This expression can be explained by the history. The prophet mentions the \u201creturn,\u201d but he has omitted the fact that this remnant should go away; and hence, all the difficulty which has been experienced in explaining this. The history informs us, <a class='ref'>,2 Kings 25:26 <\/a>,, that this remnant, this tenth part, \u2018arose and came to Egypt, for they were afraid of the Chaldees.\u2019 A part also of the nation was scattered in Moab and Edom, and among the Ammonites; <a class='ref'>,Jeremiah 40:2 <\/a>. By connecting this idea with the prophecy, there is no difficulty in explaining it. It was of the return from Egypt that the prophet here speaks; compare <a class='ref'>,Jeremiah 42:4-7 <\/a>. After this flight to Egypt they returned again to Judea, together with those who were scattered in Moab, and the neighboring regions; <a class='ref'>,Jeremiah 40:11-12 <\/a>. This renmant thus collected was what the prophet referred to as \u201creturning\u201d after it had been scattered in Egypt, and Moab, and Edom, and among the Ammonites. <p> <i>And shall be eaten <\/i>,\u2014This is an unhappy translation. It has arisen from the difficulty of making sense of the passage, by not taking into consideration the circumstances just adverted to. The word translated \u2018eaten\u2019 means to feed, to graze, to consume by grazing to consume by fire, to consume or destroy in any way, to remove. \u201cGesenius\u201d on the word \u05d1\u05e2\u05e8 ba\u0302\u201bar. Here it means that this remnant shall be for \u201cdestruction;\u201d that judgments and punishments shall follow them after their return front Egypt and Moab. Even this remnant shall be the object of divine displeasure, and shall feel the weight of his indignation; see <a class='ref'>,Jeremiah 43:1-13 <\/a>; 44. <p>As a teil-tree\u2014The word \u201cteil\u201d means the \u201clinden,\u201d though there is no evidence that the linden is denoted here. The word used here\u2014\u05d0\u05dc\u05d4 \u2018e\u0302la\u0302h\u2014is translated \u201celm\u201d in <a class='ref'>,Hosea 4:13 <\/a>,, but generally \u201coak:\u201d <a class='ref'>,Genesis 35:4; Judges 6:11, Judges 6:19; 2 Samuel 18:9, 2 Samuel 18:14 <\/a>. It is here distinguished from the \u05d0\u05dc\u05d5\u05df \u2018allo\u0302n \u201coak.\u201d It probably denotes the \u201cterebinth,\u201d or turpentine tree, for a description of which, see the notes at <a class='isa' seq='1'>,Isaiah 1:29 <\/a>. <p> <i>Whose substance <\/i>,\u2014Margin, \u2018Stock\u2019 or \u2018Stem.\u2019 The margin is the more correct translation. The word usually denotes the upright shaft, stem, or stock of a tree. It means here, whose \u201cvitality\u201d shall remain; that is, they do not entirely die. <p> <i>When they cast their leaves <\/i>,\u2014The words \u2018their leaves\u2019 are not in the original, and should not be in the translation. The Hebrew means, \u2018in their falling\u2019\u2014or when they fall. As the evergreen did \u201cnot\u201d cast its leaves, the reference is to the falling of the \u201cbody\u201d of the tree. The idea is, that when the tree should fall and decay, still the life of the tree would remain. In the root there would be life. It would send up new \u201cshoots,\u201d and thus a new tree would be produced; see the notes at <a class='isa' seq='2'>,Isaiah 4:2; Isaiah 11:1 <\/a>. This was particularly the case with the terebinth, as it is with the fir, the chestnut, the oak, the willow, etc.; see <a class='ref'>,Job 14:7 <\/a>. The idea is, that it would be so with the Jews. Though desolate, and though one judgment would follow another, and though even the renmant would be punished, yet the race would not be extinguished. It would spring up again, and survive. This was the case in the captivity of Babylon; and again the case in the destruction of Jerusalem; and in all their persecutions and trials since, the same has always occurred. They survive; and though scattered in all nations, they still live as demonstrative of the truth of the divine predictions; <a class='ref'>,Deuteronomy 28 <\/a>. <p> <i>The holy seed <\/i>,\u2014The few remaining Jews. They shall not be utterly destroyed, but shall be like the life remaining in the root of the tree. No prophecy, perhaps, has been more remarkably fulfilled than that in this verse. Though the cities be waste and the land be desolate, it is not from the poverty of the soil that the fields are abandoned by the plow, nor from any diminution of its ancient and natural fertility, that the land has rested for so many generations. Judea was not forced only by artificial means, or from local and temporary causes, into a luxuriant cultivation, such as a barren country might have been, concerning which it would not have needed a prophet to tell that, if once devastated and abandoned it would ultimately revert to its original sterility. Phenicia at all times held a far different rank among the richest countries of the world; and it was not a bleak and sterile portion of the earth, nor a land which even many ages of desolation and neglect could impoverish, that God gave in possession and by covenant to the seed of Abraham. No longer cultivated as a garden, but left like a wilderness, Judea is indeed greatly changed from what it was; all that human ingenuity and labor did devise, erect, or cultivate, people have laid waste and desolate; all the \u201cplenteous goods\u201d with which it was enriched, adorned, and blessed, have fallen like seared and withered leaves when their greenness is gone; and stripped of its \u201cancient splendor,\u201d it is left \u201cas an oak whose leaf fadeth,\u201d but its inherent sources of fertility are not dried up; the natural richness of the soil is unblighted; \u201cthe substance is in it,\u201d strong as that of the tell tree or the solid oak, which retain their substance when they east their leaves. <p>And as the leafless oak waits throughout winter for the genial warmth of returning spring, to be clothed with renewed foilage, so the once glorious land of Judea is yet full of latent vigor, or of vegetative power, strong as ever, ready to shoot forth, even \u201cbetter than at the beginning,\u201d whenever the sun of heaven shall shine on it again, and \u201cthe holy seed\u201d be prepared for being finally\u201d the substance thereof.\u201d \u201cThe substance that is in it\u201d\u2014which alone has here to be proved\u2014is, in few words, thus described by an enemy: \u201cThe land in the plains is fat and loamy, and exhibits every sign of the greatest fecundity. Were nature assisted by art, the fruits of the most distant countries might be produced within the distance of twenty leagues.\u201d \u201cGalilee,\u201d says Malte Brun, \u201cwould be a paradise, were it inhabited by an industrious people, under an enlightened government.\u201c\u2018 <p> <\/div>,",
