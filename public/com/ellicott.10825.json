    "html": " <p> (18) That draw iniquity with cords of vanity.\u2014The phrase is boldly figurative. Evil-doers are thought of as harnessing themselves as to the chariot of sin. The \u201ccords of vanity\u201d\u2014i.e., of emptiness or ungodliness\u2014are the habits by which they are thus bound. The \u201ccart ropes,\u201d thicker and stronger than the \u201ccords,\u201d represent the extreme stage, when such habits become irresistibly dominant. Probably the words may point to some idolatrous procession, in which the chariot of Baal or Ashtaroth was thus drawn by their worshippers, like that of Dem\u00eater or Cybele in Greece, or Juggern\u00e2th in India. <\/p> ",
