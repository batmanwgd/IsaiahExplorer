    "html": "<p><a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 26<\/a>is a song, or psalm, of praise that gives tribute to the Lord. It appears to be a response to God&rsquo;s release of Israel from her scattered condition in the earth (see <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTQ2XQ==\">v. 15<\/a>). Isaiah rejoiced that the righteous are highly blessed of God and observed that wicked are those who do not respond to the Lord&rsquo;s opportunities (see <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODE0MV0seyIxNzg4NiI6MTZ9XQ==\">vv. 10&ndash;11<\/a>). In typical fashion, Israel turned unto the Lord for help only when they were in great pain. In the same way a woman struggling to give birth is delivered of pain only when her child is born, so Israel will be free of pain when the Lord restores Zion once again (see <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODE0N10seyIxNzk5OSI6N31d\">vv. 16&ndash;18<\/a>). Verse 18 is a clear statement of the fact of resurrection, the Lord&rsquo;s and our own.<\/p><p>C. F. Keil and F. Delitzsch said of the song of Isaiah: &ldquo;The prophet, whom we already know as a psalmist from [<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTQzXQ==\">Isaiah 12<\/a>], now acts as choral leader of the church of the future, and praises Jehovah for having destroyed the mighty imperial city, and proved Himself a defence and shield against its tyranny towards His oppressed church&rdquo; (<em>Commentary on the Old Testament,<\/em> 7:1:436&ndash;37).<\/p><p class=\"cite\">LDS Church Educational System Old Testament Student Manual, 1 Kings&ndash;Malachi, Religion 302, Chapter 15, Item 8<\/p>",
