We are to leave the things of the world and then, \"with a voice of singing\" (48:20), proclaim the blessings of the Lord in redeeming Jacob and all who have become heir to his promises. The Lord blessed them with temporal salvation (literal water; 48:21) and \"greater\" things besides (spiritual salvation and living water; 48:22). \"Go ye forth of Babylon,\" the Lord says, for \"there is no peace&hellip;unto the wicked\" (48:20, 22).<\/p> <blockquote><i>Go ye forth<\/i> of <u>Babylon<\/u>,     <br><i>flee ye from<\/i> the <u>Chaldeans<\/u>,     <br>with a voice of singing <i>declare ye,<\/i>     <br><i>tell<\/i> this,     <br><i>utter<\/i>&hellip;to the end of the earth;     <br><i>say ye,<\/i> The Lord hath redeemed his servant Jacob. (48:20)     <br>And they thirsted not;&hellip;he led them through the deserts;     <br>he caused the <i>waters to flow<\/i> out of the <u>rock<\/u> for them:     <br>he clave the <u>rock<\/u> also and the <i>waters gushed out.<\/i> (48:21)     <br>[And notwithstanding he hath done all this, and greater also,] there is no peace, saith the Lord, unto the wicked.
