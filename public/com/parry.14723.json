    "html": " <i>Woe.<\/i> As Isaiah stood before the \"King, the Lord of hosts,\" he was painfully aware of his frailties and weaknesses as a human and mortal, and thus he exclaimed, \"Woe is unto me!\" (6:5; 5:18).<\/p> <p><i>I am undone.<\/i> The literal reading is \"I am destroyed\" or \"I am lost.\" Perhaps Isaiah felt unworthy or overwhelmed to find himself in the presence of the Lord; or, like Moses, he recognized his status in comparison to God's (<a class=\"ref\">Moses 1:9-11<\/a>). <\/p> <p><i>unclean lips.<\/i> Inasmuch as \"all [save Jesus Christ] have sinned, and come short of the glory of God\" (<a class=\"ref\">Rom. 3:23<\/a>), Isaiah too has \"unclean lips\" and has to be cleansed (6:6-7). Likewise, Joseph Smith went through a purification process (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 29:3<\/a>; JS 1:29).<\/p> <p><i>mine eyes have seen the King.<\/i> Isaiah, like many prophets, saw Jesus Christ. Nephi wrote, \"And now I, Nephi, write more of the words of Isaiah,&hellip;for he verily saw my Redeemer, even as I have seen him. And my brother, Jacob, also has seen him as I have seen him\" (<a class=\"ref\">2 Ne. 11:2-3<\/a>). <\/p> <p><i>King.<\/i> Jesus, who is called \"King of kings\" (<a class=\"ref\">Rev. 19:16<\/a>), sits on the throne in the throne room of the heavenly temple. There is a direct connection between the Lord's temples and kingship. Jesus was the heir to the throne, and we through his atonement may become \"joint-heirs with Christ\" (<a class=\"ref\">Rom. 8:17<\/a>) and sit on the throne with him and the Father (<a class=\"ref\">Rev. 3:21<\/a>). <\/p> ",
