    "html": "<p>The &ldquo;new things&rdquo; Jehovah predicts through his end-time servant (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDc5LDE4NDkwLDE4NzEyXQ==\">Isaiah 41:27; 42:9; 52:15<\/a>) establish proof of Jehovah&rsquo;s divinity and of the legitimacy of his servant at the time the world observes them coming to pass (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg2MjkiOjN9LHsiMTg1MTUiOjR9LHsiMTg1NjAiOjN9LHsiMTg1OTUiOjR9XQ==\">vv 14-16; Isaiah 43:9-12; 44:26-28; 46:8-11<\/a>). As Jehovah withholds knowledge that might condemn his people should they not live up to it, so &ldquo;a day of small things&rdquo; has prevailed until now (cf.<a class=\"ref\">Zechariah 4:10<\/a>). Typifying the end-time, on the other hand, is Jehovah&rsquo;s performing &ldquo;wonders&rdquo;&mdash;earthshaking deeds that are acknowledged throughout the earth (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc5MDUiOjJ9LFsxODEyMCwxODIwOF1d\">Isaiah 12:4-5; 25:1; 29:14<\/a>).<\/p><p>The &ldquo;new things&rdquo; Jehovah does, however, pose a hazard to persons unfamiliar with the old. When his people assume that his former works no longer relate to today, they stand to reject the new works Jehovah does as well (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgxNzkiOjl9LHsiMTg1NzEiOjN9LHsiMTg2NzEiOjR9LHsiMTg5MjciOjZ9XQ==\">Isaiah 28:14-22; 45:9-11; 50:8-11; 66:4-9<\/a>). Only persons who know his dealings in the past will thus likely comprehend his dealings in the future. As all of Jehovah&rsquo;s acts follow the patterns of the past, the new things he performs resemble the old with the exception that all now happens on a world scale and that new things may consist of composite replays of former things.<\/p> ",
