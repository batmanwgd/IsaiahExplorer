As the regenerating wilderness (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">vv 19-21<\/a>) is a creation motif, so &ldquo;weariness&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">v 22<\/a>) is a chaos motif, taking the form of &ldquo;not calling&rdquo; upon Jehovah to thank him or petition for oneself and for others as Jehovah&rsquo;s servant does (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg0NzciOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 41:25<\/a>). Even without the requirement to sacrifice animals and make oblations, such weariness characterizes the Jacob\/Israel category (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg0NDgiOjR9XQ==\">Isaiah 40:27-30<\/a>).<\/p>",
