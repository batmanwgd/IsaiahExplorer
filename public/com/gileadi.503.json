As the regenerating wilderness (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODUyNSI6M30=\">vv 19-21<\/a>) is a creation motif, so &ldquo;weariness&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NTI4XQ==\">v 22<\/a>) is a chaos motif, taking the form of &ldquo;not calling&rdquo; upon Jehovah to thank him or petition for oneself and for others as Jehovah&rsquo;s servant does (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDc3XQ==\">Isaiah 41:25<\/a>). Even without the requirement to sacrifice animals and make oblations, such weariness characterizes the Jacob\/Israel category (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODQ0OCI6NH0=\">Isaiah 40:27-30<\/a>). <\/p> ",
