    "html": " <i>Tophet is ordained of old. <\/i>This phrase may also be read \"Tophet was prepared of old.\" Tophet is an area south of Jerusalem where humans were sacrificed to Molech, a fire god. Molech's worshipers dug a large, deep pit, filled it with wood, ignited the fire, and then sacrificed humans there. Unfortunately, Molech was worshiped by apostate Israelites at various times (LDS Bible Dictionary, \"Molech\"). Now, however, justice is served because the Lord symbolically uses the deep pit and the wood to burn the wicked at his second coming, and \"the breath of the Lord, like a stream of brimstone, doth kindle it.\"<\/p> ",
