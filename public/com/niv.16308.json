Here the promise made in chapter 1 comes to its fruition. The dross has been purged away, and instead of being a harlot, Zion has become the faithful city, the mother of nations (cf. 1:25\u201327). The image of the fruitful mother reminds the attentive reader of all the places in the book where barrenness and childlessness were alluded to. The pagan fertility rituals were focused on the critical need to maintain the fertility of field and womb if life was to defeat death in the world. But Isaiah says that the only real life is that which is given as a free gift by God in response to surrender and obedience.<\/p>     <p>\u2003Nor does God give in a \u201ctit for tat\u201d fashion. His gifts are out of all proportion to whatever we have done. When humans meet their own needs, it is arduous and painful work, like giving birth. But God\u2019s gifts are childbirth without labor (66:7\u20139). Our needs are not met by our work but by our being in a position to receive the results of God\u2019s work. This is the significance of nursing at the \u201cbreasts\u201d of Zion (66:11). A baby does nothing to satisfy its own needs; it must simply own its absolute dependence and receive what has been provided.<\/p>     <p>\u2003In such a position there is rest, rejoicing, and wholeness, or \u201cpeace\u201d (66:12). As in 12:1 and elsewhere, the idea behind the word \u201ccomfort\u201d (66:13) is to encourage. Those who have felt the weight of their sin, have known their own powerlessness to deal with that sin, but have still come to God in penitent faith, believing that he can do something about it, will find themselves encouraged just as a child does on its mother\u2019s lap. The case is not hopeless, all is not lost, this thing can be recovered from. That is comfort.<\/p>     <p>\u2003But if judgment is never God\u2019s intended last word, neither is hope without conditions. Isaiah never wants his readers to be left in a position where they are so secure in God\u2019s election love that they forget the real possibility of judgment. The Lord\u2019s \u201chand\u201d (66:14) of deliverance, redemption, and power will be revealed to \u201chis servants,\u201d but it is \u201chis fury\u201d that \u201cwill be shown to his foes.\u201d Once again the question emerges: Am <small>I<\/small> among his servants or his foes?<\/p>     ",
