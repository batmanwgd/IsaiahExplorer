The <i>fragrance<\/i> may have reference to the expensive balsam oil imported from Raamah and Shebah. It was used as a cosmetic (<a class=\"ref\">Esth. 2:12; Song. 4:10<\/a>, <a class=\"ref\"> 14<\/a>) and for religious purposes (<a class=\"ref\">Ex. 25:6<\/a>). It could also refer to the use of perfumes in the last days.<\/p> <p><i>stink.<\/i> The <i>stink<\/i> might possibly be from festering wounds (<a class=\"ref\">Ps. 38:5<\/a>). <\/p> <p><i>sash\/rope.<\/i> The wealthy man's <i>sash,<\/i> or expensive belt, will be replaced with a <i>rope<\/i> by which he will be led as a slave.<\/p> <p><i>baldness\/sackcloth.<\/i> Self-imposed baldness (3:24), sitting on the ground (3:26), and sackcloth (3:24) are all symbols of mourning, mentioned in connection with the terms <i>lament<\/i> and <i>mourn<\/i> in 3:26. Clearly the context of 3:24-26 is mourning caused by God's judgments on Judah and Jerusalem as well as upon the world in the last days.<\/p> ",
