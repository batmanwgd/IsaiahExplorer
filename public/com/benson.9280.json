It is probable many of the richer sort intended to flee, and perhaps did actually flee into Egypt, having sent their treasures thither before them.<i> Therefore shall ye flee<\/i> \u2014 Your sin shall be your punishment: you<i> will<\/i> flee, and you<i> shall<\/i> flee.<i> One thousand at the rebuke of one<\/i> \u2014 You shall be so dispirited and enervated by your fears, that, instead of one of you<i> chasing a thousand,<\/i> as God promised you should do, if you were obedient, a thousand of you shall be chased by one of your enemies.<i> At the rebuke,<\/i> or assault,<i> of five<\/i> \u2014 Of a comparatively small number;<i> shall ye flee<\/i> \u2014 All of you, however numerous;<i> till ye be left,<\/i> &c. \u2014 Till ye be generally destroyed, and but a few of you left. \u201cThe meaning of the whole period is, that if the Jews, in the uncertain state of their affairs, would abstain from all endeavours to defend themselves by foreign aid, and would commit themselves to the care and providence of God, with settled minds, in faith and hope, they should then be safe, and avoid the calamities which threatened them.\u201d But this they would not do; they were determined to seek for preservation or deliverance from the yoke of the Assyrians in the help of the Egyptians, and therefore it is foretold they should meet with the calamities here mentioned; and \u201cshould be seized with such a panic fear that, when they came to the point, they should turn their backs on their enemies, and flee with that swiftness wherewith they had thought to make their enemies flee, insomuch that very few of them should escape the common destruction.\u201d<\/p> ",
