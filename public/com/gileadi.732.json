He tells us: &ldquo;I dwell on high in the holy place, and with him who is humble and lowly in spirit&mdash;refreshing the spirits of the lowly, reviving the hearts of the humble&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTg3ODE=\">Isaiah 57:15<\/a>). Jehovah&rsquo;s having &ldquo;regard for those who are of a humble and contrite spirit and who are vigilant for my word&rdquo; thus implies that, although he may appear in his earthly temple as needed to administer the affairs of his kingdom, his righteous people are also the temples of his holy Spirit (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTg4MjI=\">Isaiah 59:21<\/a>).<\/p><p>The role of Jehovah&rsquo;s <em>hand<\/em> accords with the major redemptive mission of Jehovah&rsquo;s end-time servant.
