    "html": "<p>The building of Jehovah&rsquo;s temple ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODU2MCI6M30=\">Isaiah 44:26-28<\/a>) raises the question of where Jehovah dwells and under what circumstances. He tells us: &ldquo;I dwell on high in the holy place, and with him who is humble and lowly in spirit&mdash;refreshing the spirits of the lowly, reviving the hearts of the humble&rdquo; ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzgxXQ==\">Isaiah 57:15<\/a>). Jehovah&rsquo;s having &ldquo;regard for those who are of a humble and contrite spirit and who are vigilant for my word&rdquo; thus implies that, although he may appear in his earthly temple as needed to administer the affairs of his kingdom, his righteous people are also the temples of his holy Spirit ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODIyXQ==\">Isaiah 59:21<\/a>).<\/p><p>The role of Jehovah&rsquo;s<em>hand<\/em> accords with the major redemptive mission of Jehovah&rsquo;s end-time servant. As Jehovah&rsquo;s right<em>hand<\/em> , he assists in the creation of the heavens and the earth ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4OTI1LDE4NTc0LDE4NjI4XQ==\">v 2; Isaiah 45:12; 48:13<\/a>), gathers Jehovah&rsquo;s people ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc4OTYiOjJ9LFsxODY1OV1d\">Isaiah 11:11-12; 49:22<\/a>), empowers, delivers, and protects them ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDYyLDE4NDY1LDE4NjY1LDE4NjkwLDE4ODAyXQ==\">Isaiah 41:10, 13; 50:2; 51:16; 59:1<\/a>), facilitates their new exodus ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzkwMCI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 11:15-16<\/a>), leads their new conquest ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODk5XQ==\">Isaiah 11:14<\/a>), purifies their establishment ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NjgwXQ==\">Isaiah 1:25<\/a>), allots their inheritances ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MzIxXQ==\">Isaiah 34:17<\/a>), ministers to Jehovah&rsquo;s servants ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4OTM3XQ==\">Isaiah 66:14<\/a>), and prospers Jehovah&rsquo;s purposes ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzIyLDE4ODU4XQ==\">Isaiah 53:10; 62:3<\/a>).<\/p> ",
