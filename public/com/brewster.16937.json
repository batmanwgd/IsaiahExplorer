    "html": "<p><b>(<a class=\"ref\">2 Nephi 22:2<\/a>).<\/b>\"<i>JEHOVAH.<\/i>\" The covenant or proper name of the God of the Old Testament was so highly reverenced that it was rarely spoken. In fact, the original pronunciation of the name may be unknown to mortal man. When reading orally, the Israelites substituted the name <i>Adonai,<\/i> meaning literally, <i>my Lord.<\/i> Elder James E. Talmage tells us that \"<i>Jehovah<\/i> is the Anglicized rendering of the Hebrew, <i>Yahveh<\/i> or <i>Jahveh,<\/i> signifying the <i>Self-existent One,<\/i> or <i>The Eternal.<\/i> This name is generally rendered in our English version of the Old Testament as Lord, printed in [small] capitals.\" (Talmage, p. 36; see also DCE, 276.) Of the four times the sacred name appears unchanged in the Old Testament, Isaiah uses it twice. (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3OTAzXQ==\">Isaiah 12:2<\/a>; <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTM1XQ==\">26:4<\/a>; see also <a class=\"ref\">Exodus 6:3; Psalm 83:18<\/a>.)<\/p>     <p>Latter-day Saints affirm that this holy name is the premortal name of Jesus Christ and has been used in behalf of the Savior in sacred places during His postmortal ministry. The name can be found in the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price.
