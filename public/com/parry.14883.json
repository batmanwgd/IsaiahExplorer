Compare Jeremiah's words, \"The Lord hath opened his armory, and hath brought forth the weapons of his indignation\" (<a class=\"ref\">Jer. 50:25<\/a>). <\/p> <p><i>to destroy the whole land.<\/i> Isaiah seems to be saying here that the Lord's valiant servants will successfully battle evil during this time period. A modern revelation adds light to this phrase of Isaiah: \"Wherefore, I [the Lord] call upon the weak things of the world, those who are unlearned and despised, to thrash the nations by the power of my Spirit; And their arm shall be my arm, and I will be their shield and their buckler; and I will gird up their loins, and they shall fight manfully for me; and their enemies shall be under their feet; and I will let fall the sword in their behalf, and by the fire of mine indignation will I preserve them\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 35:13-14; 133:58<\/a>). <\/p> ",
