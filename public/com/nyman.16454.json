Joseph Smith also used the term in relationship to the Book of Mormon's being proven in the eyes of all people (see TPJS, p. 267). The Lord probably calls his work a strange event because the world does not usually rely upon the Spirit to prove things. Oliver Cowdery said the angel Moroni told Joseph Smith that this strange act would bring about a marvelous work and a wonder, and that the scripture in Isaiah was about to be fulfilled (see MA, Feb. 1835, p. 79). This shows a chronological link between chapters 28 and 29.<\/p>     ",
