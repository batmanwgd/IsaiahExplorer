    "html": "<p>Jehovah commands prophets in every age to record the events of their day, both good and evil, for the benefit of posterity: (1) of evil, to illustrate the consequences of his people&rsquo;s actions; and (2) of good, to show that Jehovah at all times delivers those who keep the terms of his covenant. The Book of Isaiah contains such a message&mdash;a &ldquo;testimony&rdquo; or &ldquo;paradigm&rdquo; (<em>huqqah<\/em>)&mdash;that stands the test of time. Because Isaiah&rsquo;s day serves as a type of the &ldquo;end-time&rdquo; (<em>yom &rsquo;aharon<\/em>) ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NTQxLDE4NTk3XQ==\">Isaiah 44:7; 46:10<\/a>), his recording it in a &ldquo;book&rdquo; or &ldquo;scroll&rdquo; (<em>seper<\/em>) and on &ldquo;tablets&rdquo; or &ldquo;plates&rdquo; (<em>luah<\/em>) ensures its preservation until that day.<\/p> ",
