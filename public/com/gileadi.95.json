That Jehovah&rsquo;s alienated people suffer essentially the same fate as Babylon (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzkwOCI6MTl9\">Isaiah 13:1-19<\/a>) again signifies that their wickedness identifies them with Isaiah&rsquo;s Babylon category that falls prey to the <em>lion<\/em>&mdash;king of Assyria\/Babylon.<\/p>",
