Parallel depictions of the alien army&rsquo;s formidable weaponry and their arousal like lions seizing the prey nuances the maledictory connotation of the passage (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3sic2luZ2xlcyI6WzE3OTcwXX0seyIxNzg3NiI6Nn1d\">vv 25-30; Isaiah 15:9<\/a>). That Jehovah&rsquo;s alienated people suffer essentially the same fate as Babylon (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzkwOCI6MTl9\">Isaiah 13:1-19<\/a>) again signifies that their wickedness identifies them with Isaiah&rsquo;s Babylon category that falls prey to the <em>lion<\/em>&mdash;king of Assyria\/Babylon.<\/p>",
