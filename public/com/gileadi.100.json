Moses demonstrated that power when he smote the land of Egypt with plagues, divided the Red Sea, and brought forth water out of the earth (<a class=\"ref\">Exodus 9:22-25; 10:12-15; 14:16-28; 17:6<\/a>). Similarly, Elijah multiplied the widow&rsquo;s flour and oil, raised her child from the dead, and withheld the rain or returned it again (<a class=\"ref\">1 Kings 17:1-24; 18:42-45<\/a>). The &ldquo;mist&rdquo; or cloud of glory that fills the temple attests to Jehovah&rsquo;s manifesting his presence. <\/p> ",
