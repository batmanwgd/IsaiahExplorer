    "html": "<p> (9) And he made his grave . . .\u2014Literally, one (or, they) assigned him a grave . . . The words are often interpreted as fulfilled in our Lord\u2019s crucifixion between the two robbers and his burial in the tomb of Joseph of Arimathea. It has to be noted, however, (1) that this requires an inversion of the clauses; (2) that it introduces a feature scarcely in harmony with the general drift of the description; (3) that the laws of parallelism require us to take the \u201crich\u201d of one clause as corresponding to the \u201cwicked\u201d of the other, i.e., as in the sense of the wrongfully rich, the oppressors, as in <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 49:6; Psalms 49:16; Psalms 73:3-5<\/a>. Men assigned to the Servant not the burial of a saint, with reverence and honour (such, e.g., as that of Stephen, <a class=\"ref\">Acts 8:2<\/a>), but that of an unjust oppressor, for whom no man lamented, saying, \u201cAh lord! Ah my brother! Ah his glory!\u201d ( <a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 22:18<\/a>), and this although (not \u201cbecause\u201d) he had done no violence to deserve it. (Comp. <a class=\"ref\">Job 16:17<\/a>.) The rendering \u201cbecause\u201d has been adopted as giving a reason for the honourable burial which, it has been assumed, the words imply. It may be questioned, however, when we remember Isaiah\u2019s words as to Shebna ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MDY5XQ==\">Isaiah 22:16<\/a>), whether he would have looked on such a burial as that recorded in the Gospels, clandestine, and with no public lamentation, as an adequate recognition of the holiness of the victim. The point of the last two clauses is that they declare emphatically the absolute rectitude of the sufferer in act, his absolute veracity in speech.<\/p> ",
