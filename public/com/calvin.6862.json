    "html": "<p><i> Her gates shall mourn and lament.<\/i> Hence arises the<i> mourning of the gates<\/i> , which, he threatens, will take place when they have met with their calamities; for he means, that where there were great crowds and multitudes, nothing but a dismal solitude will be found. We know that at that time public meetings were held at<i> the gates<\/i> ; and, therefore, as the gates sometimes rejoice at the multitude of citizens, so they are said<i> to mourn<\/i> on account of their frightful desolation. And yet I do not deny that he compares Jerusalem to a woman who is sad, and who bewails her widowhood; for it was customary with mourners<i> to sit on the ground<\/i> , as that nation was in the habit of using ceremonies and outward signs to a greater degree than would be consistent with our customs. But the sum of the matter is that the city will have lost her inhabitants.<\/p> ",
