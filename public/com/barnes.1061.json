    "html": " <p> <em>Therefore, the abundance they have gotten <\/em>&mdash;Their wealth they shall remove from a place that is utterly burned up with drought, where the waters and the grass fail, to another place where they may find water. <\/p> <p> <em>To the brook of willows <\/em>&mdash;Margin, &lsquo;The valley of the Arabians.&rsquo; The Septuagint renders it, &lsquo;I will lead them to the valley of the Arabians, and they shall take it.&rsquo; So Saadias. It might, perhaps, be called the valley of the Arabians, because it was the boundary line between them and Arabia on the south. Lowth renders it, &lsquo;To Babylon.&rsquo; The probability is, that the prophet refers to some valley or brook that was called the brook of the willows, from the fact that many willows grew upon its bank. Perhaps it was the small stream which flows into the southern extremity of the Dead Sea, and which forms the boundary of Arabia Petrea of the province of Jebal. They withdrew toward the south, where toward Petra or Sela they had their property in herds <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3OTcxXQ==\">Isaiah 16:1 <\/a>,, for probably the invader came from the north, and drove them in this direction. Lowth, and most commentators, suppose that &lsquo;they&rsquo; in this verse refers to the enemies of Moab, and that it means that they would carry away the property of Moab to some distant place. But the more probable meaning is, that when the waters of the Nimrim should fail, they would remove to a place better watered; that is, they would leave their former abode, and wander away. It is an image of the desolation that was coming upon the land. <\/p>,",
