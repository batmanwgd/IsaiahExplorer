    "html": "<p>Doing &ldquo;good&rdquo; implies keeping the terms of Jehovah&rsquo;s covenant. Jehovah&rsquo;s definition of doing good includes seeking justice for the oppressed&mdash;persons unable to aid themselves. While the widows and fatherless represent those most in need, others aren&rsquo;t excluded. By citing extreme examples of persons and behaviors, Isaiah doesn&rsquo;t mean to limit things to them. The fact that Jehovah&rsquo;s people must &ldquo;learn&rdquo; to do good suggests that they no longer know. The words &ldquo;demand,&rdquo; &ldquo;stand up for,&rdquo; &ldquo;plead,&rdquo; and &ldquo;appeal&rdquo; go beyond passively noticing others&rsquo; needs to actively intervening on their behalf.<\/p> ",
