    "html": "<p>While the &ldquo;vintage&rdquo; or &ldquo;harvest&rdquo; (<em>basir<\/em>) of the earth denotes the destruction of the wicked in Jehovah&rsquo;s Day of Judgment, those who are &ldquo;gleaned&rdquo; out of it comprise a righteous remnant of Jehovah&rsquo;s people: &ldquo;In that day Jehovah will thresh out [his harvest] from the torrent of the River to the streams of Egypt. But you shall be gleaned one by one, O children of Israel. In that day a loud trumpet shall sound, and they who were lost in the land of Assyria and they who were outcasts in the land of Egypt shall come and bow down to Jehovah in the holy mountain at Jerusalem&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 27:12-13<\/a>; cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODg2OSI6M30=\">63:2-4<\/a>).<\/p><p>Songs of Salvation erupt from Jehovah&rsquo;s elect people in two chief places where Jehovah delivers them: (1) where &ldquo;these&rdquo; take refuge&mdash;that is, in the land of Israel; and (2) where &ldquo;[those] from across the sea... in the regions of sunrise... in the isles of the sea&rdquo; await Israel&rsquo;s God. Those in the land of Israel lift up their voice and rejoice in Jehovah&rsquo;s salvation, while those abroad exult at Jehovah&rsquo;s ingenuity in orchestrating events in such a way as to deliver them (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 12:1-6; 42:1-12<\/a>). Secondarily, those who &ldquo;lift up&rdquo; or &ldquo;sustain&rdquo; (<em>yis&rsquo;u<\/em>) their <em>voice<\/em> uphold or sustain Jehovah&rsquo;s servant (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 50:10; 52:8<\/a>).<\/p>",
