Even as ancient Israel passed safely through the waters of the Red Sea, with the Egyptian armies in pursuit, so will we pass unharmed through our own difficult waters. God promises, \"When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee\" (43:2). Also, as Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego came out of Nebuchadnezzar's fiery furnace with not \"an hair of their head singed, neither were their coats changed, nor the smell of fire had passed on them\" (<a class=\"ref\">Dan. 3:26-27<\/a>), so God promises us, \"When thou walkest through the fires thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the flame kindle upon thee\" (43:2).<\/i><\/p> ",
