    "html": " <p> <i>And his Spirit.<\/i>, He proceeds with that threatening which he had begun to utter, namely, that the Church will indeed be chastised, but yet that the Assyrians shall utterly perish; for he says that they will be plunged into the deep by the \u201cSpirit\u201d of God, or rather, that the \u201cSpirit\u201d himself is like a deep torrent which shall swallow them up. Others translate <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05e8\u05d5\u05d4<\/span>, <i>(r\u016b\u0103ch<\/i>,) by \u201cblowing,\u201d and think that the allusion is to a storm or violent wind. <\/p>\n <p> <i>And with a useless sieve.<\/i>, The next metaphor employed is that of a \u201csieve,\u201d which is very frequent in Scripture (<a class=\"ref\">Matthew 3:12<\/a>.) He says that he will shake the Assyrians with a sieve, in order to thrash and scatter them; and therefore he calls it \u201cthe sieve of vanity,\u201d that is, a useless sieve, intended not to preserve, but to destroy; for, in another sense, the Lord is wont to \u201csift\u201d his own people also, so as to gather them like good grain into the barn. <\/p>\n <p> <i>And a bridle causing to err.<\/i>, The third metaphor is that of a \u201cbridle,\u201d by which the Lord continually restrains the pride and rebelliousness of wicked men, and, in a word, shews that he is their Judge. True, indeed, the Lord commonly restrains and subdues his own people by a \u201cbridle,\u201d but it is in order to bring them to obedience; while, on the other hand, he restrains wicked men in such a manner as to cast them down headlong to destruction. This is what he means by the phrase \u201ccausing to err.\u201d As furious horses are driven about in all directions by their riders, and, the more they kick are more violently struck and beaten; so the ungodly, when they are kept back, rush eagerly in the opposite direction, as it is beautifully described by David. (<a class=\"ref\">Psalms 32:9<\/a>.) <\/p>\n <p>The object of these metaphors is to shew that we must not sport with the Lord; for, although he appear for a time to act differently, we shall at length know by experience the truth of what the Prophet says, that his \u201cbreath\u201d alone will be like a torrent to cast down the wicked, that they may be suddenly overwhelmed. Next, when he gives warning that the nations shall be winnowed with \u201ca useless sieve,\u201d we ought to fear lest the Lord, if he find in us nothing but chaff, throw us on the dunghill. Lastly, we must observe the difference that exists between the children of God and the reprobate; for the Lord chastises both, but in different ways\u2014the children of God, that they may be purified and preserved\u2014and the reprobate, that they may be cast down headlong and destroyed. <\/p>\n\n <p>FT565 \u201cGrotius renders <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05e8\u05d5\u05d7<\/span>, (<i>r\u016b\u0103ch<\/i>) <i>anger<\/i>, Luther and the English version <i>breath<\/i>,; but there is no sufficient reason for excluding an allusion to the Holy Spirit as a personal agent.\u201d \u2014 <i>Alexander <\/i> <\/p>\n <p>FT566 \u201cThe sieve of emptiness. A sieve full of holes, that suffers both corn and chaff to pass together to the ground. So shall Jehovah make no distinction among the enemies of Israel.\u201d \u2014 <i>Stock <\/i> <\/p>\n <p>FT567 \u201cAnd a misleading bridle.\u201d \u2014 <i>Alexander <\/i> <\/p>\n <p>FT568 \u201cHis glorious voice. (Heb. The glory of his voice.)\u201d\u2014Eng. Ver. \u201cThe majesty of his voice.\u201d \u2014 <i>Stock <\/i> <\/p>\n <p>FT569 Calvin\u2019s phrase, <span class=\"aramaic_text\">, baculus fundatas<\/span>, is followed by almost all the Latin interpreters, including Vitringa, and appears to have suggested the rendering, grounded staff, which is given in our common version, and has been followed by other translators. Almost all the commentators treat <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05de\u05d5\u05e1\u05d3\u05d4<\/span>, (<i>m\u016bs\u0101d\u0101h<\/i>) as the particple Hophal of <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d9\u05e1\u05d3<\/span>, (<i>y\u0101s\u0103d <\/i>); but there are strong reasons for viewing it as an abstract noun, for Rosenm\u00fcller has justly remarked that <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05de\u05d8\u05d4<\/span>, (<i>m\u0103tt\u0113h<\/i>,) with Tzere instead of Segol, is in the construct state. Availing himself, as it would seem, of this suggestion, Professor Alexander very felicitously renders it \u201cthe rod of doom.\u201d \u201cThe common version, grounded staff,\u201d says he, \u201cis almost unintelligible. It is now very generally agreed that <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05de\u05d5\u05e1\u05d3\u05d4<\/span>, (<i>m\u016bs\u0101d\u0101h<\/i>) denotes the divine determination or decree, and that the whole phrase means the rod appointed by him, or, to put it in a form at once exact and poetical, the rod of destiny or doom.\u201d Diodati\u2019s Italian version gives \u201c(lang. it) Ed ogni passagio della verga ferma,\u201d \u201cand every passage of the firm staff.\u201d \u2014 <i>Ed <\/i> <\/p>\n <p>FT570 \u201c <span class=\"aramaic_text\">, Que la playe a est\u00e9 attachee au dos de l\u2019Assyrien<\/span>,;\u201d\u2014\u201cThat the wound has been fastened to the back of the Assyrian.\u201d <\/p>\n <p>FT571 <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d2\u05d9\u05d0 \u05d4\u05e0\u05d5\u05dd<\/span>, (<i>g\u0113h\u012dnn\u014dm<\/i>,) \u201cthe Valley of Hinnom.\u201d <\/p>\n <p>FT572 \u201cOf old.\u201d\u2014Eng.
