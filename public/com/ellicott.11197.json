The chapter is remarkable, as showing that the prophet\u2019s work was not limited to Judah and Jerusalem, but extended to the northern kingdom. The warning was clearly uttered before the capture of Samaria by Salmaneser, or, more probably, by Sargon, and paints in vivid colours\u2014reminding us in part of <a class=\"ref\">Amos 6:4-6<\/a>, not without a side glance at the like vices in Jerusalem (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MDY2XQ==\">Isaiah 22:13<\/a>)\u2014the license into which the capital of the northern kingdom had fallen. With a bold personification the words paint (1) the banquet with its revellers, crowned, as in the later days of Rome, with wreaths of flowers; and (2) Samaria itself as such a wreath, once beautiful, now fading, crowning the \u201chead\u201d of the \u201cfat,\u201d or luxuriant, valley (literally, valley of oils, or, fat things) in which the revellers held their feasts. Cheyne notes that the inscription of Salmaneser records that the tribute of Jehu consisted of bowls, cups, and goblets of gold, as illustrating the luxury of the palace of Samaria (Records of the Past, v. 41). The LXX. strangely renders the last clause, \u201cdrunk without wine,\u201d as if from a reminiscence of <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MjAzXQ==\">Isaiah 29:9<\/a>, and gives the \u201chirelings of Ephraim\u201d instead of \u201cdrunkards.\u201d<\/p>",
