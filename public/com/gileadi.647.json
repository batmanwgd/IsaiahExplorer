    "html": "<p>To whichever paradigm of life Jehovah&rsquo;s people subscribe&mdash;the King of Zion&rsquo;s or the king of Babylon&rsquo;s&mdash;that paradigm, not their religious affiliation, determines whom they worship. The woman&rsquo;s consorting with a king other than the King of Zion implies that she has transferred her loyalty to the archtyrant. While her oils and perfumes betray her covenantal allegiance, the woman&rsquo;s sending her solicitors far abroad denotes her actively marketing her depravity. By so doing, the unfaithful wife&mdash;Jehovah&rsquo;s apostate people&mdash;aligns herself, and thus identifies with, the Harlot Babylon (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 47:15<\/a>).<\/p>",
