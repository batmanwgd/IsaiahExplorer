    "html": "<p><b>(<a class=\"ref\">2 Nephi 18:16<\/a>).<\/b>\"<i>Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples.<\/i>\" This wording is also found in latter-day revelation, although in two instances the Lord speaks of \"sealing the testimony\" and \"binding the law.\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 88:84; 109:46; 133:71-72<\/a>.) The law represents teachings and the testimony represents the inspired utterances of God's messengers. One commentary indicates that the binding and sealing of the law is a symbolic process whereby one actually ties up a parchment roll, whereon the teachings of the prophets are recorded, as a witness against those to whom the message was delivered. (TOVBC, 420.) Another suggests that this may be figurative in the sense of a document being signed in the hearts of the disciples. (BMC, 204.)<\/p>",
