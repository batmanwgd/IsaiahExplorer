The Lord first warned our ancestors through the voice of many prophets, each of whom in turn warned, testified, and prophesied of impending destruction; afterward, the Lord permitted the fierce armies of Assyria to capture and kill these people.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>Much may be learned from these lessons in history. We, modern Israel, should always follow the voice of our prophets, who, like Isaiah and other ancient prophets, declare the word of the Lord. We should also look into our own lives to determine how much pride we possess, or how often we sin against the Lord.<\/i><\/p> ",
