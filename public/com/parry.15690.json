The scriptures define the <i>standard<\/i> as God's words (specifically, the Book of Mormon; <a class=\"ref\">2 Ne. 29:2<\/a>), the everlasting covenant (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 45:9<\/a>), the great Zion of the last days (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 64:41-43<\/a>), and the light of the righteous or the Church and its faithful members (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 115:3-5<\/a>).
