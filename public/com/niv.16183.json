And in that day a great trumpet will sound. Those who were perishing in Assyria and those who were exiled in Egypt will come and worship the LORD on the holy mountain in Jerusalem.<\/p>     <h4>Original Meaning<\/h4>     <p>I<small>N THE EARLIER CHAPTERS<\/small> in this subdivision (Isa. 24\u201327), which celebrate God\u2019s lordship over history, the songs are those of drunkards trying to forget (24:9), or of ruthless triumph (25:5), or praise for God\u2019s security (26:1). The present song is a more intimate one. It praises God for delivering his people and celebrates his personal relationship with them. In this sense it forms the conclusion of the four chapters. The first and second songs (chs. 24 and 25) declare universal judgment and universal salvation. In the third (ch. 26), the people proclaim their trust in God, but they also confess their inability to deliver themselves and fulfill their ministry in the world. Now, God confirms his promise to deliver them.<\/p>     <p>\u2003Here we have the opposite picture from the one we saw in chapter 5. There God called in the wild animals to destroy the vineyard of bitter grapes, his nation. He tore down the walls and left it to \u201cbriers and thorns\u201d (5:6). Now we see the \u201cvineyard\u201d from the other side. God says he is \u201cnot angry,\u201d and he wishes that there were \u201cbriers and thorns\u201d for him to contend with (27:4), so that he could chop them down and burn them. But in a mixing of metaphors, he says the thorns and briers (evidently the nations) could come and \u201cmake peace\u201d with him (27:5). In any case, the vineyard of \u201cJacob\u201d is going to be so fruitful that it will fill \u201cthe world with fruit\u201d (27:6).<\/p>     <p>\u2003What accounts for this radical shift? Surely God <em>was<\/em> angry with his people, angry enough to destroy them. Yet here he talks as if those words had never been said. Verses 6\u201311 explain the matter. God did not bring destruction on Israel for the purpose of annihilating his people, his vineyard. If they want to see that kind of destruction, let them look at those whom God used as tools to strike the punishing blows (27:7).<\/p>     <p>\u2003Yes, God had indeed driven Israel out, like a tumbleweed before a driving windstorm (27:8). But his purpose was not annihilation but cleansing. That point comes clear in 27:9, where God says that the fruit of the \u201cremoval of his sin\u201d will be the destruction of idol worship. The Hebrew of the verse is obscure, so that we do not know the means by which \u201cJacob\u2019s guilt [will] be atoned for,\u201d but the result is clear. Out of the fires of the Exile, the idolatry that was the obvious sign of disloyalty to the covenant Lord will be done away with.<\/p>     <p>\u2003There is a clear causal connection between 27:9 and 10 in the Hebrew. Verse 10 begins with <em>ki<\/em> (\u201cbecause\u201d). This shows we must at least read verse 9, if not verses 7\u20139, with verses 10\u201311. But what that connection portends is not entirely clear because the identity of \u201cthe fortified city\u201d is not spelled out. Elsewhere in this section this city seems to represent the oppressors of God\u2019s people (25:2). If that is the case, it seems to me the most natural reading is that when the \u201cfortified city,\u201d a \u201cpeople without understanding,\u201d is destroyed, Israel will be set free by God\u2019s grace and will respond with renewed obedience to the covenant.<\/p>     <p>\u2003The other alternative is that there has been a shift of metaphor and that \u201cthe fortified city\u201d is now a reference to Jerusalem, which it would be natural to assume in the immediate context. The phrase \u201cwithout understanding\u201d also sounds much like what is said of Israel in 1:3. In this case, the passage is restating the point in 27:8 as to why the destruction was needed. On balance, and without a sign that the metaphor has been shifted, I tend to side with the former of the two understandings.<\/p>     <p>\u2003Isaiah 27:12\u201313 cap the Lord\u2019s promises to his people. The writer begins with the metaphor of harvest. The Lord will not allow one kernel of grain or one olive to be lost but will diligently gather them all from the distant borders of the land\u2014the \u201cEuphrates\u201d in the north and the \u201cWadi of Egypt\u201d in the south. The same point is made with a different metaphor, the trumpet call of muster for battle, in verse 13. The \u201cexiles\u201d from north and south are called to \u201cworship the LORD on the holy mountain,\u201d where the last great feast is to be held (25:6\u20138).<\/p>     <h4>Bridging Contexts<\/h4>     <p>I<small>F FEW OF US<\/small> have vineyards today, many of us are familiar with <em>This Old House<\/em>. We might think of what God is saying here along those lines. God just wishes that some termites would show up in the old house. How he would delight in rooting them out and repairing the damage they have done. The new work would be better than the original. Or what about tearing out some old plumbing and wiring? God would love to lavish attention on the old place. In the end you would hardly recognize it from what he started with. Why would he do it? To sell it and make a lot of money? Never! He would pour so much of himself into the work because that is where he wants to live.<\/p>     <p>\u2003We continually have to remind ourselves that idolatry is not first of all the making of figures of gods and goddesses. It is an attitude, the attitude that I must find a way to manipulate the forces in control of the universe to satisfy my needs. The statues, then, are simply a way to visualize those forces and make them amenable to my control.<\/p>     <p>\u2003But the statues are only symptoms. It is possible to have the attitude of an idolater and never think of making an idol. Whenever I try to satisfy my needs for myself by manipulating the elements of the creation, I am succumbing to idolatry. God calls us to surrender our needs to him and to trust him to meet those needs in his ways. Usually he will meet them through our talents and abilities, but it is the attitude with which we do it that makes all the difference.<\/p>     <h4>Contemporary Significance<\/h4>     <p>G<small>OD\u2019S ACTIONS IN<\/small> our lives today continue to be not for the purpose of destruction but for refinement. If trouble and adversity have come our way, our attitude about God will make all the difference in how we receive them. If we think of God as passionately loving \u201cthe old house\u201d that we are, then the ripping of the saw and the crashing of the hammer will still be painful but much easier to bear. But if we think of him as the implacable judge determined to wring the last ounce of retribution out of us, the blows will be heavy indeed.<\/p>     <p>\u2003It is also important to keep the lesson of Job in mind. Adversity and trouble do not have easy explanations, and sometimes to give easy explanations in a glib manner can do more damage than the trouble itself. Job\u2019s \u201ccomforters\u201d would have done much better to remain silent than to give faulty explanations concerning what they knew nothing about.<\/p>     <p>\u2003What we should do is to use difficulty as an opportunity. Is there something that has come between me and God? Has my loyalty to my covenant Lord become diluted? Has my surrender to him and my trust become less than total? If the answer to any of these is \u201cyes,\u201d then there is only one option: godly sorrow, repentance, and flinging oneself on his divine grace. This was Paul\u2019s goal in calling for the expulsion of an immoral man from the church in Corinth. It was not punishment but the hope that hardship would bring about restoration (1 Cor. 5:5).<\/p>     <p>\u2003If there is no conviction from the Holy Spirit that a certain suffering is deserved, then the admonition of Peter is appropriate:<\/p>     <blockquote>         <p>\u2003Dear friends, do not be surprised at the painful trial you are suffering, as though something strange were happening to you. But rejoice that you participate in the sufferings of Christ, so that you may be overjoyed when his glory is revealed. (1 Peter 4:12\u201313)<\/p>     <\/blockquote>     <p>This is not easy for us who are tempted to avoid pain at all costs. But we must realize that God does not have destruction in mind when he allows suffering to come across our path. If it is not for discipline, it may well be for a testimony of his grace in the conflict with evil. At any rate, we can know that just as Christ\u2019s sufferings led to his glory, so may ours (1 Peter 5:10), for God\u2019s final purpose is to lead us beyond judgment to the final ingathering.<\/p>     ",
