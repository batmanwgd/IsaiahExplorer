In this chapter we have, I. A very awful vision which Isaiah saw of the glory of God (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzc3MSI6NH0=\">Isaiah 6:1-4<\/a>), the terror it put him into (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3Nzc1XQ==\">Isaiah 6:5<\/a>), and the relief given him against that terror by an assurance of the pardon of his sins, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3Nzc2XQ==\">Isaiah 6:6<\/a> . II. A very awful commission which Isaiah received to go as a prophet, in God's name (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3Nzc4XQ==\">Isaiah 6:8<\/a>), by his preaching to harden the impenitent in sin and ripen them for ruin (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzc3OSI6NH0=\">Isaiah 6:9-12<\/a>) yet with a reservation of mercy for a remnant, (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzgzXQ==\">Isaiah 6:13<\/a>). And it was as to an evangelical prophet that these things were shown him and said to him.<\/p> ",
