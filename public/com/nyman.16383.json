The Book of Mormon does not have the word \"his\" preceding \"government,\" but the JST does retain the word \"his\" while following the other slight changes in the Book of Mormon.<\/p>     <p>The angel who appeared to Mary identified the Son who was to be born to her as He who would occupy the throne of David (see <a class=\"ref\">Luke 1:32<\/a>).
