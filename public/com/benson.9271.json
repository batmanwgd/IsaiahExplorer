He made me not; or the thing framed, say of him that framed it, He hath no understanding.\u201d Bishop Lowth reads the passage in the interrogative form, and thereby gives it still more force: \u201cPerverse as ye are! shall the potter be esteemed as the clay? Shall the work say of the workman, He hath not made me?\u201d &c. \u201cWe, and all our works are in the hands of God, as clay in the hands of the potter, to give what form and fashion to them he pleases; and when the finest schemes are laid, he can work things to a quite contrary end.\u201d\u2014Lowth. <\/p>",
