    "html": " <p> <i>How art thou fallen from heaven!<\/i>, Isaiah proceeds with the discourse which he had formerly begun as personating the dead, and concludes that the tyrant differs in no respect from other men, though his object was to lead men to believe that he was some god. He employs an elegant metaphor, by comparing him to <i>Lucifer<\/i>, and calls him the <i>Son of the Dawn<\/i>,; and that on account of his splendor and brightness with which he shone above others. The exposition of this passage, which some have given, as if it referred to Satan, has arisen from ignorance; for the context plainly shows that these statements must be understood in reference to the king of the Babylonians. But when passages of Scripture are taken up at random, and no attention is paid to the context, we need not wonder that mistakes of this kind frequently arise. Yet it was an instance of very gross ignorance, to imagine that <i>Lucifer<\/i>, was the king of devils, and that the Prophet gave him this name. But as these inventions have no probability whatever, let us pass by them as useless fables. <\/p>\n <p> <i>Casting the lot upon the nations,<\/i>, or <i>weakening the nations.<\/i>, Translators have mistaken the meaning of this clause, by rendering the participle <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d4\u05d5\u05dc\u05e9<\/span>, (<i>holesh<\/i>) passively, <i>Thou art become weak<\/i>, for its signification is active. But as the verb from which it is derived signifies <i>to cast a lot<\/i>, and as the preposition <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05e2\u05dc<\/span>, (<i>gnal<\/i>,) <i>upon<\/i>, is here added, it is best to take it in this meaning, that, as the ruler and disposer of all countries, he directed them by lot, or held them as his own possessions. And yet I do not reject the other meaning, that he <i>weakened the nations <\/i> <\/p>\n\n <p>FT212 <i>Which didst weaken the nations<\/i>,.\u2014Eng. Ver. <\/p>\n <p>FT213 For the origin and application of this \u201cproverb,\u201d see <i>Com. on the Gospel according to John<\/i>, vol. 1 p. 223, note 1: \u2014 <i>Ed <\/i> <\/p>\n <p>FT214 <i>Upon the mountain of the congregation<\/i>,.\u2014Eng.

I will make for me a small cloud in the air, and will dwell in it.\u201d \u2014 <i>Jarchi <\/i> <\/p>\n <p>FT217 \u201cIt is curious that the Welsh language still preserves this meaning of the word <i>beth<\/i>, a <i>last home<\/i>,; for it is the appropriate term in that language for <i>a grave<\/i>,. \u201d \u2014 <i>Stock <\/i> <\/p>\n <p>FT218 <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05e2\u05d5\u05dc\u05dd<\/span>, (<i>gnolam<\/i>) is derived from <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05e2\u05dc\u05dd<\/span>, (<i>gnalam<\/i>,) <i>to hide<\/i>, and is defined by the lexicographers to mean \u201can age, a time <i>hidden<\/i>, from men, either unlimited and eternal or limited.\u201d Our author treats it as capable of meaning either <i>time past<\/i>, or <i>time to come<\/i>,. \u2014 <i>Ed <\/i> <\/p>\n <p>FT219 <i>For the bittern<\/i>,.\u2014Eng.

An early genealogy informs us that the <i>Philistim<\/i>, or <i>Philistines<\/i>, were descendants of Mizraim, a son of Ham.
