    "html": "<p><em>And they shall call them<\/em>&mdash;It shall be the honorable and just name by which they shall be known, that they are a holy people, and that they are the redeemed of Yahweh. No name is so honorable as that; no one conveys so much that is elevated and ennobling as to say of one, &lsquo;he is one whom Yahweh has redeemed from sin and death and hell by atoning blood.&rsquo; He who has a just sense of the import of this name, will desire no Other record to be made of his life&mdash;no other inscription on his tomb&mdash;than that he is one who has been redeemed by Yahweh.<\/p><p><em>And thou shalt be called<\/em>&mdash;(See the notes at <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg4NTciOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 62:2<\/a>).<\/p><p><em>Sought out<\/em>&mdash;The city much sought after, or much desired&mdash;to wit, by converts who shall come from afar; by foreigners who shall come to do thee honor (see <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc2ODkiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 2:3<\/a> ; <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg0MjYiOjJ9LHsiMTg0MzEiOjJ9LHsiMTg2NTUiOjV9XQ==\">Isaiah 40:5-6, Isaiah 40:10-11; Isaiah 49:18-22<\/a>). Or it may mean that Jerusalem would be a city sought out and desired by Yahweh; that is, no more forsaken by him. So Gesenius understands it.<\/p><p><em>A city not forsaken<\/em>&mdash;No longer given up to the invasions of a foreign enemy, and abandoned to long desolation. The idea is, that the church and people of God would be the object of his kind protecting care henceforward, and would enjoy his continued smiles.<\/p>",
