    "html": "<p><em>And if thou draw out thy soul to the hungry \"If thou bring forth thy bread to the hungry\"<\/em> - \"To draw out thy soul to the hungry,\" as our translators rightly enough express the present Hebrew text, is an obscure phrase, and without example in any other place. But instead of<span class=\"greek-hebrew\"> \u05e0\u05e4\u05e9\u05da<\/span><span class=\"translit\"> naphshecha<\/span> , thy soul, eight MSS. (three ancient) of Kennicott's and three of De Rossi's read<span class=\"greek-hebrew\"> \u05dc\u05d7\u05de\u05da<\/span><span class=\"translit\"> lachmecha<\/span> , thy bread; and so the Syriac renders it. The Septuagint express both words,<span class=\"greek-hebrew\"> \u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03b1\u03c1\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03b5\u03ba \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c8\u03c5\u03c7\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c3\u03bf\u03c5<\/span> , \"thy bread from thy soul.\" I cannot help thinking, however, that this reading is a gloss, and should not be adopted. To draw out the soul in relieving the poor, is to do it, not of constraint or necessity, but cheerfully, and is both nervous and elegant. His soul pities and his hand gives.<\/p> ",
