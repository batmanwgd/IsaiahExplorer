    "html": "<p> The parties invited are now to be thought of as present, and Jehovah commences in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDU0XQ==\">Isaiah 41:2<\/a> : <em> \u201cWho hath raised up the man from the rising of the sun, whom justice meets at his foot, He giveth up nations before him, and kings He subdues, giveth men like the dust to his sword, and like driven stubble to his bow?\u201d<\/em> The sentence governed by \u201cwho\u201d (<em> m\u0131\u0304 <\/em> ) ends at <em> l e raglo\u0304 <\/em> (at his foot); at the same time, all that follows is spoken with the echo of the interrogative accent. The person raised up is Cyrus, who is afterwards mentioned by name. The coming one (if, that is to say, we adhere to the belief in Isaiah's authorship of these addresses) first approaches gradually within the horizon of the prophet's ideal present; and it is only little by little that the prophet becomes more intimately acquainted with a phenomenon which belongs to so distant a future, and has been brought so close to his own eyes. Jehovah has raised up the new great hero \u201cfrom the east\u201d (<em> m immizra\u0302ch <\/em> ), and, according to <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDc3XQ==\">Isaiah 41:25<\/a>, \u201cfrom the north\u201d also. Both of these were fulfilled; for Cyrus was a Persian belonging to the clan of Achaemenes (<em> Hakha\u0302manis <\/em> ), which stood at the head of the tribe, or of the Pasargadae. He was the son of Cambyses; and even if the Median princess Mandane were not his mother, yet, according to nearly all the ancient accounts, he was connected with the royal house of Media; at any rate, after Astyages was dethroned, he became head and chief of the Medes as well as of the Persians (hence the name of \u201cMule\u201d which was give to him by the oracle, and that given by Jerome, \u201c<em> agitator bigae <\/em> \u201d). Now Media was to the north of Babylonia, and Persia to the east; so that his victorious march, in which, even before the conquest of Babylon, he subjugated all the lands from the heights of Hinduku to the shores of the Aegean Sea, had for its starting-point both the east and north.<\/p><p> (Note: See Pahl'es <em> Geschichte des Oriental. Alterthums<\/em> . (1864), p. 170ff.)<\/p><p> The clause \u05dc\u05e8\u05d2\u05dc\u05d5 \u05d9\u05e7\u05e8\u05d0\u05d4\u05d5\u05bc \u05e6\u05d3\u05e7 is an attributive clause, and as such a virtual object: \u201chim whom (supply \u05e2\u05ea\u05be\u05d0\u05e9\u05c1\u05e8 ) justice comes to meet ( \u05e7\u05e8\u05d0 ) = \u05e7\u05e8\u05d4 , Ges. \u00a775, vi.) on his track\u201d (cf., <a class=\"ref\">Genesis 30:30; Job 18:11; Habakkuk 3:5<\/a>). The idea of <em> tsedeq <\/em> is determined by what follows: Jehovah gives up nations before him, and causes kings to be trodden down (causative of <em> ra\u0302da\u0302h <\/em> ). Accordingly, <em> tsedeq <\/em> is either to be understood here in an attributive sense, as denoting the justice exercised by a person (viz., the justice executed successfully by Cyrus, as the instrument of Jehovah, by the force of arms); or objectively of the justice awarded to a person (to which the idea of \u201cmeeting\u201d is more appropriate), viz., the favourable result, the victory which procures justice for the just cause of the combatant. Rosenm\u00fcller, Knobel, and others, are wrong in maintaining that <em> tsedeq <\/em> (<em> ts e da\u0302qa\u0302h <\/em> ) in chapters 40-66 signifies primarily justice, and the prosperity and salvation as its reward. The word means straightness, justice, righteousness, and nothing more (from <em> tsa\u0302daq <\/em> , to be hard, firm, extended, straight, e.g., <em> rumh<\/em> -<em> un<\/em> -<em> tsadq <\/em> , a hard, firm, and straight lance); but it has a double aspect, because justice consists, according to circumstances, of either wrath of favour, and therefore has sometimes the idea of the strict execution of justice, as in this instance, sometimes of a manifestation of justice in fidelity to promises, as in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDYyXQ==\">Isaiah 41:10<\/a>. \u05d9\u05ea\u05bc\u05df is repeated here in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDU0XQ==\">Isaiah 41:2<\/a> (just like \u05d5\u05d9\u05dc\u05de\u05d3\u05d4\u05d5 in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDM1XQ==\">Isaiah 40:14<\/a>) with the same subject, but in a different sense. To make sword and bow the subject, in the sense of \u201chis sword gives (sc., 'the foe'),\u201d is a doubtful thing in itself; and as <em> cherebh <\/em> and <em> qesheth <\/em> are feminines, it is by no means advisable. Moreover, in other instances, the comparative \u05db leaves it to the reader to carry out the figure indicated according to his own fancy. And this is the case here: He (Jehovah) makes his sword as if there were dust, his bow as if there were hunted stubble (B\u00f6ttcher), i.e., pounding the enemy like dust, and hunting it like flying stubble. Our text has \u05db\u05bc\u05e2\u05e4\u05e8 , but in certain codices we find \u05db\u05bc\u05e2\u05e4\u05e8 with <em> tzere <\/em> ; and this reading, which is contrary to rule, has in its favour the express testimony of Moses the punctuator.<\/p><p> (Note: In his \u05d4\u05e0\u05e7\u05d5\u05d3 \u05d3\u05e8\u05db\u05d9 (rules of pointing), with which the <em> Masora finalis <\/em> is surrounded.)<\/p>",
