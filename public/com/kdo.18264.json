    "html": "<p> The prophecy now turns again to those already indicated and threatened in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODg5OSI6N30=\">Isaiah 65:1-7<\/a>. <em> \u201cAnd ye, who are enemies to Jehovah, O ye that are unmindful of my holy mountain, who prepare a table for Gad, and fill up mixed drink for the goddess of destiny - I have destined you to the sword, and ye will all bow down to the slaughter, because I have called and ye have not replied, I have spoken and ye have not heard; and ye did evil in mine eyes, and ye chose that which I did not like.\u201d<\/em> It may be taken for granted as a thing generally admitted, that  refers to two deities, and to the <em> lectisternia <\/em> (meals of the gods, cf., <a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 7:18; Jeremiah 51:44<\/a>) held in their honour. \u05e9\u05c1\u05dc\u05d7\u05df \u05e2\u05e8 \u05da is the other side of the <em> lectum sternere <\/em> , i.e., the spreading of the cushions upon which the images of the gods were placed during such meals of the gods as these. In the passage before us, at any rate, the <em> lectus <\/em> answering to the <em> shulcha\u0302n <\/em> (like the <em> sella <\/em> used in the case of the goddesses) is to be taken as a couch for eating, not for sleeping on. In the second clause, therefore, \u05de\u05de\u05e1 \u05da \u05dc\u05de\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d5\u05d4\u05de\u05de\u05dc\u05d0\u05d9 \u05dd (which is falsely accentuated in our editions with <em> tifchah m ercha silluk<\/em> , instead of <em> m ercha tifchah silluk<\/em> ), \u05de\u05de\u05e1\u05da \u05de\u05dc\u05bc\u05d0 signifies to fill with mixed drink, i.e., with wine mixed with spices, probably oil of spikenard. \u05de\u05dc\u05bc\u05d0 may be connected not only with the accusative of the vessel filled, but also with that of the thing with which it is filled (e.g., <a class=\"ref\">Exodus 28:17<\/a>). Both names have the article, like \u05d4\u05d1\u05bc\u05e2\u05dc . \u05d4\u05d2\u05bc\u05d3 is perfectly clear; if used as an appellative, it would mean \u201cgood fortune.\u201d The word has this meaning in all the three leading Semitic dialects, and it also occurs in this sense in <a class=\"ref\">Genesis 30:11<\/a>, where the <em> chethib<\/em> is to be read \u05d1\u05bc\u05d2\u05d3 (lxx \u03b5\u0313\u03bd \u03c4\u03c5\u0301\u03c7\u03b7\u0345 ). The Aramaean definitive is \u05d2\u05bc\u05d3\u05bc\u05d0 (not \u05d2\u05bc\u05d3\u05d0 ), as the Arabic <em> 'gadd <\/em> evidently shows. The primary word is \u05d2\u05bc\u05d3\u05d3 (Arab. <em> 'gadda <\/em> ), to cut off, to apportion; so that Arab. <em> jaddun <\/em> , like the synonymous <em> h\u0323ad\u0323d\u0323un <\/em> , signifies that which is appointed, more especially the good fortune appointed. There can be no doubt, therefore, that <em> Gad<\/em> , the god of good fortune, more especially if the name of the place <em> Baal<\/em> -<em> Gad<\/em> is to be explained in the same way as <em> Baal<\/em> -<em> hamm\u00e2n<\/em> , is Baal ( Bel ) as the god of good fortune. Gecatilia ( Mose ha-Cohen ) observes, that this is the deified planet Jupiter. This star is called by the Arabs \u201cthe greater luck\u201d as being the star of good fortune; and in all probability it is also the <em> rabb<\/em> -<em> el<\/em> -<em> bacht<\/em> (lord of good fortune) worshipped by the Ssabians (Chwolsohn, ii. 30, 32). It is true that it is only from the passage before us that we learn that it was worshipped by the Babylonians; for although H. Rawlinson once thought that he had found the names <em> Gad<\/em> and <em> Menni<\/em> in certain Babylonian inscriptions (<em> Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society<\/em> , xii. p. 478), the Babylonian Pantheon in G. Rawlinson's <em> Monarchies<\/em> contains neither of these names. With this want of corroborative testimony, the fact is worthy of notice, that a Rabbi named <em> 'Ulla<\/em> , who sprang from Babylon, explains the \u05d3\u05e8\u05d2\u05e9\u05c1 of the <em> Mishna<\/em> by \u05d3\u05d2\u05d3\u05d0 \u05e2\u05e8\u05e1\u05d0 (a sofa dedicated to the god of prosperity, and often left unused) (b. <em> Nedarim<\/em> 56<em> a<\/em> ; cf., <em> Sanhedrin<\/em> 20<em> a<\/em> ).<\/p><p> (Note: The foreign formula of incantation given in <em> b. Sabbath<\/em> 67<em> a<\/em> , \u05d5\u05d1\u05d5\u05e9\u05db\u05d9 \u05e2\u05d5\u05e9\u05d3\u05d9 \u05dc \u05d5\u05e1\u05d9\u05e0\u05d5\u05e7 \u05d9\u05d3\u05d2 \u05d3\u05d2 (according to the glosses, \u201cO Fortune, give good fortune, and be not tardy day and night\u201d), also belongs here; whereas the name of a place not far from Siloah, called <em> Gad<\/em> -<em> yavan<\/em> (Gad of Greece), contains some allusion to the mythology of Greece, which we are unable to trace. In the later usage of the language <em> Gad<\/em> appears to have acquired the general meaning of <em> numen <\/em> (e.g., <em> b. Chullin<\/em> 40<em> a<\/em> ; \u05d3\u05d4\u05e8 \u05d2\u05d3 , the mountain-spirit); and this helps to explain the fact that in Pehlewi \u05d2\u05d3\u05de\u05df signifies majesty in a royal, titular sense (see Vuller's <em> Lex.<\/em> ; and Spiegel in the <em> Indische Studien<\/em> , 3, 412).)<\/p><p> But if <em> Gad<\/em> is Jupiter, nothing is more probable than that <em> Meni<\/em> is Venus; for the planet Venus is also regarded as a star of prosperity, and is called by the Arabs \u201cthe lesser luck.\u201d The name <em> Meni<\/em> in itself, indeed, does not necessarily point to a female deity; for <em> m e ni <\/em> from <em> m a\u0302na\u0302h <\/em> , if taken as a passive participial noun (like \u05d2\u05bc\u05e8\u05d9 \u05d1\u05bc\u05e8\u05d9\u05d4 , a creature), signifies \u201cthat which is apportioned;\u201d or if taken as a modification of the primary form <em> many<\/em> , like \u05d2\u05bc\u05d3\u05d9 , \u05d8\u05dc\u05d9 , \u05e6\u05d1\u05d9 , and many others, allotment, destination, fate. We have synonyms in the Arabic <em> mana - n <\/em> and <em> meniye <\/em> , and the Persian <em> bacht <\/em> (adopted into the Arabic), which signify the general fate, and from which <em> bago - bacht <\/em> is distinguished as signifying that which is exceptionally allotted by the gods. The existence of a deity of this name <em> m e ni <\/em> is also probably confirmed by the occurrence of the personal name \u05e2\u05d1\u05d3\u05de\u05e0\u05d9 on certain Aramaeo-Persian coins of the Achaemenides,<\/p><p> (Note: See <em> R\u00f6diger<\/em> in the concluding part of the <em> thes.<\/em> p. 97.)<\/p><p> with which F\u00fcrst associates the personal name <em> Achiman<\/em> (see his <em> Lex<\/em> .), combining \u05de\u05df with \u039c\u03b7\u0301\u03bd , and \u05de\u05e0\u05d9 with \u039c\u03b7\u0301\u03bd\u03b7 , as Movers (<em> Ph\u00f6nizier<\/em> , i. 650) and Knobel have also done. \u05de\u05df and \u05de\u05e0\u05d9 would then be Semitic forms of these Indo-Germanic names of deities; for \u039c\u03b7\u0301\u03bd is <em> Deus Lunus<\/em> , the worship of which in Carrae (<em> Charran<\/em> ) is mentioned by Spartian in chapter vi. of the <em> Life of Caracalla<\/em> , whilst Strabo (xii. 3, 31, 32) speaks of it as being worshipped in Pontus, Phrygia, and other places; and \u039c\u03b7\u0301\u03bd\u03b7 is <em> Dea Luna<\/em> (cf., \u0393\u03b5\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9\u0301\u03c4\u03b7 \u039c\u03b1\u0301\u03bd\u03b7 in Plut. <em> quaest. rom.<\/em> 52, <em> Genita Mana<\/em> in Plin. <em> h. n.<\/em> 29, 4, and <em> Dea Mena<\/em> in Augustine, <em> Civ<\/em> . 4, 11), which was worshipped, according to Diodorus (iii. 56) and Nonnus (<em> Dionys<\/em> . v. 70 ss.), in Phoenicia and Africa. The rendering of the lxx may be quoted in favour of the identity of the latter with \u05de\u05e0\u05d9 ( \u03b5\u0314\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9\u03bc\u03b1\u0301\u03b6\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2 \u03c4\u03c9\u0345\u0342 \u03b4\u03b1\u03b9\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03b9\u0301\u03c9\u0345 (another reading \u03b4\u03b1\u03b9\u0301\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03b9 \u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u0301\u03c0\u03b5\u03b6\u03b1\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9\u0300 \u03c0\u03bb\u03b7\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5\u0342\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b7\u0345\u0342 \u03c4\u03c5\u0301\u03c7\u03b7\u0345 \u03ba\u03b5\u0301\u03c1\u03b1\u03c3\u03bc\u03b1 ), especially if we compare with this what Macrobius says in <em> Saturn<\/em> . i. 19, viz., that \u201caccording to the Egyptians there are four of the gods which preside over the birth of men, \u0394\u03b1\u03b9\u0301\u03bc\u03c9\u03bd \u03a4\u03c5\u0301\u03c7\u03b7 \u0313\u0301\u0395\u03c1\u03c9\u03c3 \u0313\u0391\u03bd\u03b1\u0301\u03b3\u03ba\u03b7 . Of these <em> Daimo\u0304n <\/em> is the sun, the author of spirit, of warmth, and of light. <em> Tyche\u0304 <\/em> is the moon, as the goddess through whom all bodies below the moon grow and disappear, and whose ever changing course accompanies the multiform changes of this mortal life.\u201d<\/p><p> (Note: See Ge. Zoega's <em> Abhandlungen<\/em> , edited by Welcker (1817), pp. 39, 40.)<\/p><p> In perfect harmony with this is the following passage of <em> Vettius Valens<\/em> , the astrologer of Antioch, which has been brought to light by Selden in his <em> Syntagma de Diis Syris<\/em> : \u039a\u03bb\u03b7\u0342\u03c1\u03bf\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b7\u0342\u03c2 \u03c4\u03c5\u0301\u03c7\u03b7\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9\u0300 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u0342 \u03b4\u03b1\u03b9\u0301\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c3\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9\u0301\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd (viz., by the signs of nativity) \u03b7\u0314\u0300\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd \u03c4\u03b5 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9\u0300 \u03c3\u03b5\u03bb\u03b7\u0301\u03bd\u03b7\u03bd . Rosenm\u00fcller very properly traces back the Sept. rendering to this Egyptian view, according to which <em> Gad<\/em> is the sun-god, and <em> M e ni<\/em> the lunar goddess as the power of fate. Now it is quite true that the passage before us refers to Babylonian deities, and not to Egyptian; at the same time there might be some relation between the two views, just as in other instances ancient Babylonia and Egypt coincide.<\/p><p> But there are many objections that may be offered to the combination of \u05de\u05e0\u05d9 ( Meni ) and \u039c\u03b7\u0301\u03bd\u03b7 : (1.) The Babylonian moon-deity was either called <em> S\u0131\u0304n <\/em> , as among the ancient Shemites generally, or else by other names connected with \u05d9\u05e8\u05d7 ( \u05d9\u05e8\u05d7 ) and <em> c ha\u0302mar <\/em> . (2.) The moon is called <em> m a\u0302s <\/em> is Sanscrit, Zendic <em> m a\u0302o <\/em> , Neo-Pers. <em> m a\u0302h <\/em> (<em> m ah <\/em> ); but in the Arian languages we meet with no such names as could be traced to a root <em> m a\u0302n <\/em> as the expansion of <em> m a\u0302 <\/em> (to measure), like \u03bc \u03b7\u0301\u03bd \u03bc \u03b7\u0301\u03bd\u03b7 ), Goth. <em> m ena <\/em> ; for the ancient proper names which Movers cites, viz., \u0313\u0391\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03bc\u03b5\u0301\u03bd\u03b7\u03c3 \u0313\u0391\u03c1\u03c4\u03b1\u03bc\u03b5\u0301\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2 , etc., are traceable rather to the Arian <em> m anas <\/em> = \u03bc \u03b5\u0301\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 , mens, with which <em> Minerva<\/em> (<em> Menerva<\/em> , endowed with mind) is connected. (3.) If <em> m e ni <\/em> were the Semitic form of the name for the moon, we should expect a closer reciprocal relation in the meanings of the words. We therefore subscribe to the view propounded by Gesenius, who adopts the pairing of Jupiter and Venus common among the Arabs, as the two heavenly bodies that preside over the fortunes of men; and understands by <em> M e ni<\/em> Venus, and by <em> Gad<\/em> Jupiter. There is nothing at variance with this in the fact that <em> 'Ashtoreth<\/em> (<em> Ishtar<\/em> , with <em> ' Ashe\u0304ra\u0302h <\/em> ) is the name of Venus (the morning star), as we have shown at <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3OTQxXQ==\">Isaiah 14:12<\/a>. <em> M e ni<\/em> is her special name as the bestower of good fortune and the distributor of fate generally; probably identical with <em> Man\u00e2t<\/em> , one of the three leading deities of the prae-Islamitish Arabs.<\/p><p> (Note: See Krehl, <em> Religion der vorislamischen Araber<\/em> , p. 78. Sprenger in his <em> Life of Mohammad<\/em> , 1862, compares the Arabic <em> Mana\u0302t <\/em> with \u05de\u05e0\u05d9 .)<\/p><p> The address proceeds with <em> uma\u0302n\u0131\u0304th\u0131\u0304 <\/em> (and I have measured), which forms an apodosis and contains a play upon the name of <em> Meni<\/em> , <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4OTA5XQ==\">Isaiah 65:11<\/a> being as it were a protasis indicating the principal reason of their approaching fate. Because they sued for the favour of the two gods of fortune (the Arabs call them <em> es - sa'da\u0302ni <\/em> , \u201cthe two fortunes\u201d) and put Jehovah into the shade, Jehovah would assign them to the sword, and they would all have to bow down ( \u05db\u05bc\u05e8\u05e2 as in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODU1XQ==\">Isaiah 10:4<\/a>). Another reason is now assigned for this, the address thus completing the circle, viz., because when I called ye did not reply, when I spake ye did not hear (this is expressed in the same paratactic manner as in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzQ0LDE3OTAyLDE4NjY1XQ==\">Isaiah 5:4; Isaiah 12:1; Isaiah 50:2<\/a>), and ye have done, etc.: an explanatory clause, consisting of four members, which is repeated almost word for word in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4OTI3XQ==\">Isaiah 66:4<\/a> (cf., <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzU4XQ==\">Isaiah 56:4<\/a>).<\/p>",
