Jerusalem here stands as a symbol for the people of the covenant.<\/p> <p><i>stones with fair colours.<\/i> Some versions indicate that the stones will be laid with antimony, which women used as a cosmetic to enhance the color of their eyes (<a class=\"ref\">2 Kgs. 9:30; Jer. 4:30<\/a>). In the same way, the mortar in the foundation and walls will help to set off the beauty of the precious stones. Jerusalem, which was once destroyed and left desolate, will be restored and beautified by the Lord in the form of a new Jerusalem.<\/p> ",
