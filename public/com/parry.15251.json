    "html": " <i>light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun. <\/i>This passage may be understood in several ways: The magnification of the sun \"sevenfold, as the light of seven days\" may be symbolic of the seventh thousand-year period of the earth, the Millennium, when Christ and his much greater light will be on the earth. In 24:23, these same heavenly bodies symbolically participated in a great event associated with Jehovah, so the moon and the sun are linked to the time when the Lord \"bindeth up the breach of his people, and healeth the stroke of their wound.\" Moreover, the moon and sun's increase in brightness may indicate the increase in the light of Christ, Holy Ghost, and gifts of the Spirit that will be present among the people after their wounds are healed. Heavenly spheres have often been mentioned in prophecies in a literal manner; perhaps this prophecy will have a literal fulfillment.<\/p> <p><i>Lord bindeth up the breach.<\/i> The Lord will remove the \"breach in the wall\" caused by Israel's wickedness (30:13). This primary function of the atonement of Jesus Christ makes us \"at one\" with God.<\/p> <p><i>Lord<\/i>&hellip;<i>healeth the stroke of their wound. <\/i>Through the power of the Atonement, Jehovah, the great physician, heals Israel's spiritual wounds.<\/p> ",
