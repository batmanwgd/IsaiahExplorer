    "html": " <p>To the righteous the Lord says, in effect, \"You can build me a temple, but that which I desire most is the person with a broken heart and a contrite spirit, a person who hearkens to my word (66:1-2). I will come to justify you in your righteousness, while your enemy will be ashamed\" (66:5).<\/p> <p>To the wicked the Lord seems to say, \"Those who choose their own way, who will not hearken unto me, will have their worst fears come upon them (66:3-4). Those who persecute the righteous will be ashamed (66:5). I come in power to bring justice on my enemies\" (66:6).<\/p> <blockquote>Thus saith the Lord, The <i>heaven<\/i> is <u>my throne<\/u>,     <br>and the <i>earth<\/i> is <u>my footstool<\/u>:     <br><i>where is the house<\/i> that ye build <u>unto me<\/u>?     <br>and <i>where is the place<\/i> of <u>my rest<\/u>?

(66:2)     <br>He that <i>killeth an ox<\/i> is <u>as if he slew a man<\/u>;     <br>he that <i>sacrificeth a lamb,<\/i> <u>as if he cut off a dog's neck<\/u>;     <br>he that <i>offereth an oblation,<\/i> <u>as if he offered swine's blood<\/u>;     <br>he that <i>burneth incense,<\/i> <u>as if he blessed an idol<\/u>.     <br>Yea, <i>they have chosen<\/i> <u>their own ways<\/u>,     <br>and <i>their soul delighteth<\/i> in <u>their abominations<\/u>.
