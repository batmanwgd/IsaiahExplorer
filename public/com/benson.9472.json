And because his word is with power, and what he commands he in certain cases effects, this is a prediction and promise what he should do, that she should <i>awake <\/i>or <i>arise <\/i>out of her low estate, and be strong and courageous. <i>Put on thy beautiful garments <\/i>\u2014 Thy sorrows shall be ended, and thou shalt be advanced in a glorious condition. <i>O Zion <\/i>\u2014 O my church, very frequently called by the name of Zion or Jerusalem. <i>There shall no more come unto thee <\/i>\u2014 To molest, or associate themselves with, and thereby to defile and corrupt thee; <i>the uncircumcised and unclean <\/i>\u2014 Heathen and infidels, nor any others who are unholy. Whereby he intimates, that there should be a greater reformation and more purity in the church than formerly there had been, which was eminently accomplished in the church and kingdom of Christ. <i>Shake thyself from the dust <\/i>\u2014 In which thou hast lain as a prisoner, or sat as a mourner. <i>Arise, and sit down <\/i>\u2014 Upon thy throne. Or <i>sit up, <\/i>as the word  <span class=\"hebrew_text\">\u05e9\u05c1\u05d1\u05d9<\/span>is rendered, <a class=\"ref\">Genesis 27:19<\/a>. <i>Loose thyself, <\/i>&c. \u2014 The yoke of thy captivity shall be taken off from thee. <i>Ye have sold yourselves<\/i> \u2014 By your sins, into the hands of your enemies; <i>for naught <\/i>\u2014 Without any price or valuable consideration paid by them, either to you or to your lord and owner. <i>And ye shall be redeemed without money <\/i>\u2014 Without paying any ransom.<\/p>",
