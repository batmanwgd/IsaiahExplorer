Though they had laid the plan of a regular siege; though the city, in itself, would not be able to hold out against them, and all was alarm and conscious imbecility within; yet in an instant the siege would be raised, and the advancing hosts of the Assyrians would all be gone.<\/p><p><em>The multitude of thy strangers<\/em>&mdash;The multitude of the strangers that shall besiege thee; called &lsquo;thy strangers,&rsquo; because they besieged, or oppressed thee. The word &rsquo;strangers&rsquo; here, as elsewhere, means &ldquo;foreigners&rdquo; (see the note at <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 1:7<\/a> ; compare <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzU3LDE3OTMwXQ==\">Isaiah 2:6; Isaiah 5:17; Isaiah 14:1<\/a> ; <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 25:2<\/a> , <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTk5LDE4ODMyXQ==\">Isaiah 25:5; Isaiah 29:5; Isaiah 60:10<\/a>).<\/p><p><em>Shall be like small dust<\/em>&mdash;Light, fine dust that is easily dissipated by the wind.<\/p><p><em>Of the terrible ones<\/em>&mdash;Of the invading, besieging army, that is so much the object of dread.<\/p><p><em>As chaff that passeth away<\/em>&mdash;(see the note at <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 17:13<\/a> ). This image of chaff driven before the wind, to denote the sudden and entire discomfiture of enemies, is common in the Scriptures (see <a class=\"ref\">Job 21:18; Psalm 1:4; Psalm 35:5; Hosea 13:13<\/a>).<\/p><p><em>Yea, it shall be at an instant suddenly<\/em>&mdash;The forces of Sennacherib were destroyed in a single night by the angel of the Lord (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 37:36<\/a> ; the note at <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzg3OSI6N30=\">Isaiah 10:12, Isaiah 10:28-34<\/a>, note), and the siege of Jerusalem was of course immediately raised.<\/p>",
