Isaiah's reference to ointment calls to mind some possible symbolic interpretations. That Lady Israel's wounds and sores were not treated with oil could mean that Israel had forsaken the true temple worship and was involved in apostate temple practices (see commentary on 1:10-16 and 1:29-31). Furthermore, ointment may symbolize the healing power of the blood of the Atonement, meaning that the Israelites failed to make the Atonement effective in their lives by turning to the Lord and repenting. Similarly, all who reject Christ's atonement remain spiritually sick or unhealed.<\/p> ",
