    "html": "<p><em>And he shall be for a sanctuary \"And he shall be unto you a sanctuary\"\u2014<\/em>The word <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05dc\u05db\u05dd <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">lachem<\/span>, unto you, absolutely necessary, as I conceive, to the sense, is lost in this place: it is preserved by the Vulgate, \"<i>et erit vobis in sanctificationem<\/i>.\" The Septuagint have it in the singular number: <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u03b5\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c3\u03bf\u03b9 \u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u03b1\u0314\u03b3\u03b9\u03b1\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd<\/span>, it shall be to Thee. Or else, instead of <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05de\u05e7\u05d3\u05e9 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">mikdash<\/span>, a sanctuary, we must read <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05de\u05d5\u05e7\u05e9 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">mokesh<\/span>, a snare, which would then be repeated without any propriety or elegance, at the end of the verse. The Chaldee reads instead of it <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05de\u05e9\u05e4\u05d8 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">mishpat<\/span>, judgment; for he renders it by <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05e4\u05d5\u05e8\u05e2\u05df <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">purean<\/span>, which word frequently answers to <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05de\u05e9\u05e4\u05d8 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">mishpat<\/span>  in his paraphrase. One MS. has in stead of <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d5\u05dc\u05d0\u05d1\u05df \u05de\u05e7\u05d3\u05e9 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">mikdash uleeben<\/span>, <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05dc\u05d0\u05d1\u05df \u05dc\u05d4\u05dd <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">lahem leeben<\/span>, which clears the sense and construction. But the reading of the Vulgate is, I think, the best remedy to this difficulty; and is in some degree authorized by <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05dc\u05d4\u05dd <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">lahem<\/span>, the reading of the MS. above mentioned.<\/p>",
