    "html": " <p> <em>The Lord of hosts hath purposed it <\/em>&mdash;(see the note at <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NjY0XQ==\">Isaiah 1:9 <\/a>). It is not by human counsel that it has been done. Whoever is the instrument, yet the overthrow of wicked, proud, and vicious cities and nations is to be traced to the God who rules in the empires and kingdoms of the earth (see the notes at <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzg1NiI6M30=\">Isaiah 10:5-7 <\/a>). <\/p> <p> <em>To stain, the pride of all glory <\/em>&mdash;Margin, &lsquo;Pollute.&rsquo; The Hebrew word (\u05d7\u05dc\u05dc chale\u0304l) means properly to bore, or pierce through; to open, make common <a class=\"ref\">Leviticus 19:29 <\/a>; then to profane, defile, pollute, as, e. g., the sanctuary <a class=\"ref\">Leviticus 19:8; Leviticus 21:9 <\/a>,, the Sabbath <a class=\"ref\">Exodus 31:14 <\/a>,, the name of God <a class=\"ref\">Leviticus 18:21; Leviticus 19:12 <\/a>. Here it means that the destruction of Tyre would show that God could easily level it all with the dust. The destruction of Tyre would show this in reference to all human glory, because: <\/p> <p>(1) it was one of the most ancient cities; <\/p> <p>(2) it was one of the most magnificent; <\/p> <p>(3) it was one: of the most strong, secure, and inaccessible; <\/p> <p>(4) it was the one of most commercial importante, most distinguished in the view of nations; and <\/p> <p>(5) its example would be the most striking and impressive. <\/p> <p>God often selects the most distinguished and important cities and people to make them examples to others, and to show the ease with which he can bring all down to the earth. <\/p> <p> <em>To bring into contempt... <\/em>&mdash;To bring their plans and purposes into contempt, and to show how unimportant and how foolish are their schemes in the sight of a holy God. <\/p>,",
