The moral and social state described in it points to an earlier date than the reformation of Hezekiah. The sins of the people are more flagrant; but there is not as yet with them the added guilt of a formal and ceremonial worship. The character of the king in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 3:12<\/a> corresponds with that of Ahaz. The influence of the Philistines, traceable in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 2:6<\/a>, is probably connected with their invasion of Judah in that reign (<a class=\"ref\">2 Chronicles 28:18<\/a>). The mention of \u201cships of Tarshish\u201d in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 2:16<\/a> points to a time when the commerce of the Red Sea (<a class=\"ref\">1 Kings 9:26; 1 Kings 22:48<\/a>) was still in the hands of Judah, and prior, therefore, to the capture of Elath by Rezin, king of Syria (<a class=\"ref\">2 Kings 16:6<\/a>). We are able, therefore, with hardly the shadow of uncertainty, to fix the date of the whole section as belonging to the early years of the reign of Ahaz, with, perhaps, a backward glance at evils which belonged also to the reigns of Uzziah and Jotham. The title of the superscription unites in an exceptional form the two ideas of the prophet and of the seer. What follows is \u201cthe word\u201d of Isaiah, but it is a word that he has seen.<\/p>",
