    "html": "<p> And when we consider that the Holy Land is at the present time an extensive pasture-ground for Arab shepherds, and that the modern Jerusalem which has arisen from the dust is a Mohammedan city, we may see in this also a literal fulfilment of <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzU3XQ==\">Isaiah 5:17<\/a> : <em> \u201cAnd lambs feed as upon their pasture, and nomad shepherds eat the waste places of the fat ones.\u201d<\/em> There is no necessity to supply an object to the verb \u05d5\u05e8\u05e2\u05d5\u05bc , as Knobel and others assume, viz., the waste lands mentioned in the second clause; nor is <em> C eda\u0302bra\u0302m <\/em> to be taken as the object, as Caspari supposes; but the place referred to is determined by the context: in the place where Jerusalem is sunken, there lambs feed after the manner of their own pasture-ground, i.e., just as if they were in their old accustomed pasture (<em> dober <\/em> , as in <a class=\"ref\">Micah 2:12<\/a>, from <em> da\u0302bar <\/em> , to drive). The lambs intended are those of the <em> ga\u0302rim <\/em> mentioned in the second clause. The <em> ga\u0302rim <\/em> themselves are men leading an unsettled, nomad, or pilgrim life; as distinguished from <em> ge\u0302rim <\/em> , strangers visiting, or even settled at a place. The lxx have \u03b1\u0313\u0301\u03c1\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2 , so that they must have read either <em> C a\u0302rim <\/em> or <em> geda\u0302im <\/em> , which Ewald, Knobel, and others adopt. But one feature of the prophecy, which is sustained by the historical fulfilment, is thereby obliterated. <em> Cha\u0302rboth <\/em> <em> m e\u0302chim <\/em> are the lands of those that were formerly marrowy, i.e., fat and strutting about in their fulness; which lands had now become waste places. Knobel's statement, that <em> a\u0302ca\u0306l <\/em> is out of place in connection with <em> ga\u0302rim <\/em> , is overthrown by <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NjYyXQ==\">Isaiah 1:7<\/a>, to which he himself refers, though he makes he-goats the subject instead of men. The second woe closes with <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzU3XQ==\">Isaiah 5:17<\/a>. It is the longest of all. This also serves to confirm the fact that luxury was the leading vice of Judah in the time of Uzziah-Jotham, as it was that of Israel under Jeroboam II (see <a class=\"ref\">Amos 6:1-14<\/a>, where the same threat is held out).<\/p>",
