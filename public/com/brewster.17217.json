As a plant or root growing in arid ground, He will need the nurturing of others to survive. In addition to the conditions of the physical ground, the young Seedling who would later declare Himself to be the \"root \u2026 of David\" (<a class=\"ref\">Revelation 22:16<\/a>) will also find Himself being raised in the spiritually dry and barren conditions of an apostate people.<\/p>",
