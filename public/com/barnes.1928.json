    "html": "<p><em>The glory of Lebanon<\/em>&mdash;The &lsquo;glory of Lebanon,&rsquo; here means the trees that grew on Lebanon (see the notes at <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MzIzXQ==\">Isaiah 35:2<\/a>).<\/p><p><em>Shall come unto thee<\/em>&mdash;That is, thy beauty and glory will be as great as if those valuable trees were brought and planted around the temple.<\/p><p>The fir-tree&mdash;(See the notes at <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDcxLDE4NzU0XQ==\">Isaiah 41:19; Isaiah 55:13<\/a>).<\/p><p><em>The box<\/em>&mdash;(See also the notes at <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDcxXQ==\">Isaiah 41:19<\/a>).<\/p><p><em>To beautify the place of my sanctuary<\/em>&mdash;The site of the temple, as if they were planted around it, and as if the magnificence of Lebanon was transferred there at once. The idea is, that the most valuable and glorious objects in distant nations would be consecrated to the service of the true God.<\/p><p><em>And I will make the place of my feet glorious<\/em>&mdash;Lowth renders this, &lsquo;I will glorify the place whereon I rest my feet;&rsquo; and he supposes thai the ark is meant as the place on which God rested his feet as a footstool. In support of this, he appeals to <a class=\"ref\">Psalm 99:5<\/a> , &lsquo;Worship at his footstool;&rsquo; and <a class=\"ref\">1 Chronicles 28:2<\/a>. So Rosenmuller understands it, and appeals further to <a class=\"ref\">Psalm 132:7<\/a>. Doubtless the main idea is, that the temple was regarded as the sacred dwelling-place of God&mdash;and that he means to say, that every place in his temple, even where, to keep up the figure, he rested his feet when he sat on the throne, would be filled with magnificence and glory.<\/p> ",
