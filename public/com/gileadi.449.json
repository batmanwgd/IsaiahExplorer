Having ascended to the seraph level, Isaiah&rsquo;s perspective broadens. He perceives how fickle people are. Without Jehovah&rsquo;s Spirit to animate them the best of them resemble but fading flowers (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxNzc2NF0seyIxODAxMSI6Mn0sWzE4MzgwXV0=\">Isaiah 5:24; 19:6-7; 37:27 <\/a>).
