The MS. here varies only in one letter from the reading of the other two verses; it has <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d1\u05d0\u05e8\u05e5 <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">,baarets <\/span>,, instead of <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d4\u05d0\u05e8\u05e5 <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">,haarets <\/span>,. None of De Rossi's MSS. confirm this addition. The line added is, When he ariseth to strike the earth with terror. <\/p>,",
