The two groups of four and three, making up the symbolic seven, may probably have a mystic meaning. The \u201cshittah\u201d is the acacia, the \u201coil tree\u201d the wild olive, as distinguished from the cultivated (<a class=\"ref\">Romans 11:17<\/a>), the \u201cfir tree\u201d is probably the cypress, the \u201cpine\u201d stands for the plane, always\u2014as in the opening of Plato\u2019s Ph\u0153drus, and the story of Xerxes in Herod. vii. 31,\u2014the glory of Eastern scenery and the \u201cbox-tree\u201d is perhaps the larch, or a variety of cedar.
