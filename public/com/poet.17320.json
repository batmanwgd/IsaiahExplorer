Upon the succession of Sargon to the Assyrian throne in 721 B.C., Merodach-Baladan took advantage of the chaos that accompanied the change in leadership. With the support of the Elamites, inhabitants of southeast Mesopotamia, Merodach-Baladan was successful in making himself king of Babylon. Finally, in 710 B.C., Sargon succeeded in retaking Babylon; marching in unopposed, he made himself king. Still, he was unable to oust Merodach-Baladan from his tribal lands in Bit-Yakin. Merodach-Baladan retained his position as local ruler in his native area by submitting to Assyrian rule for the remainder of Sargon's days.<\/p> <p>But upon Sargon's death in 705 B.C., Merodach-Baladan resumed his anti-Assyrian activites. With his confidence strengthened through a new alliance with the Arabs and by relying upon the support of the Elamites, Merodach-Baladan sent an embassy to Hezekiah (<a class=\"ref\">2 Kgs. 20<\/a>; <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isa. 39<\/a>), hoping to entice the Assyrians' vassals in the west to rebellion. Unfortunately for Merodach-Baladan, Isaiah was strongly opposed to an alliance with the Babylonians and counseled Hezekiah against supporting this rebel Chaldean king.<\/p>",
