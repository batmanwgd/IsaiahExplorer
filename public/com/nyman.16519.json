The instruction to \"drop down, ye heavens, from above, and let the skies pour down righteousness\" is fulfilled in the visitations of angels (such as the angel Moroni) and the giving of other types of revelation. To \"let the earth open, and let them bring forth salvation\" is to bring forth a record such as the Book of Mormon, which contains the fulness of the gospel. In words similar to these, Enoch was given a promise concerning that which would lead to the building of the New Jerusalem in the latter days (see <a class=\"ref\">Moses 7:62<\/a>). In commenting on the passage in Moses, Joseph Smith said: \"And now, I ask, how righteousness and truth are going to sweep the earth as with a flood? I will answer. Men and angels are to be co-workers in bringing to pass this great work, and Zion is to be prepared, even a new Jerusalem, for the elect that are to be gathered from the four quarters of the earth, and to be established an holy city, for the tabernacle of the Lord shall be with them.\" (TPJS, p. 84.) The Psalmist also spoke of the time when \"Truth shall spring out of the earth; and righteousness shall look down from heaven\" (<a class=\"ref\">Ps. 85:11<\/a>).<\/p>     ",
