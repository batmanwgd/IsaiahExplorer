Here the breakdown of social structure as a result of sin is burning up the land (9:18), and God\u2019s righteous judgment adds tinder to the flame (9:19). As the terrific pressure of Assyria\u2019s demand for tribute mounts higher and higher, everyone scrambles to save his or her own neck; if that means robbing your neighbor or even your brother, then so be it.<\/p>     <p>\u2003Ultimately, as the final siege begins, the devouring of one\u2019s \u201cown offspring\u201d ceases to be metaphorical and becomes a horrible, literal fact (9:20). In a world where self reigns supreme, no one is safe. In the kingdom of northern Israel, the two dominant tribal groups were Ephraim and Manasseh.
