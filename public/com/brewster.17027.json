Those who reject <i>or<\/i> neglect the words of living bread that can stave off spiritual starvation, or the truths of livingwaters that can quench spiritual thirst, will find their souls empty and their spirits faint. No matter how often they eat bread at the tables of the learned, or drink the waters of the man-made religions of the world, they will not be satisfied.<\/p>     <p>Philosophies and theological teachings, no matter how well intended, that lack true spiritual nutrients (the fulness of the gospel and priesthood power) will not satisfy the soul's hunger for truth. We are reminded of the Savior's words to the woman at the well in Samaria: \"Whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.\" (<a class=\"ref\">John 4:14<\/a>.)<\/p>     <p>Furthermore, we think of this divine promise: \"And blessed are all they who do hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be <i>filled with the Holy Ghost.<\/i>\" (<a class=\"ref\">3 Nephi 12:6<\/a>; italics added.)<\/p>     <p>The words of a prophet of old are worth pondering in this respect: \"Cursed is he that putteth his trust in man, or maketh flesh his arm, or shall hearken unto the precepts of men, save their precepts shall be given by the power of the Holy Ghost.\" (<a class=\"ref\">2 Nephi 28:31<\/a>.)<\/p>",
