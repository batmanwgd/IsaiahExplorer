    "html": "<p><em>These two things are come unto thee<\/em> &mdash;Margin, &lsquo;Happened.&rsquo; That is, two sources of calamity have come upon thee; to wit, famine and the sword, producing desolation and destruction; or desolation by famine, and destruction by the sword (see Lowth on Hebrew Poetry, Lect. xix.) The idea here is, that far-spread destruction had occurred, caused by the two things, famine and the sword.<\/p><p><em>Who shall be sorry for thee?<\/em> &mdash;That is, who shall be able so to pity thee as to furnish relief?<\/p><p><em>Desolation<\/em> &mdash;By famine.<\/p><p><em>And destruction<\/em> &mdash;Margin, as Hebrew, &lsquo;Breaking.&rsquo; refers to the calamities which would be inflicted by the sword. The land would be desolated, and famine would spread over it. This refers, doubtless, to the series of calamities that would come upon it in connection with the invasion of the Chaldeans.<\/p><p><em>By whom shall I comfort thee?<\/em> &mdash;This intimates a desire on the part of Yahweh to give them consolation. But the idea is, that the land would be laid waste, and that they who would have been the natural comforters should be destroyed. There would be none left to whom a resort could be had for consolation.<\/p> ",
