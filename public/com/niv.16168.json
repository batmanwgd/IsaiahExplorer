I will place on his shoulder the key to the house of David; what he opens no one can shut, and what he shuts no one can open. I will drive him like a peg into a firm place; he will be a seat of honor for the house of his father. All the glory of his family will hang on him: its offspring and offshoots\u2014all its lesser vessels, from the bowls to all the jars.<\/p>         <p>\u2003\u201cIn that day,\u201d declares the L<small>ORD<\/small> Almighty, \u201cthe peg driven into the firm place will give way; it will be sheared off and will fall, and the load hanging on it will be cut down.\u201d The L<small>ORD<\/small> has spoken.<\/p>     <\/blockquote>     <h4>Original Meaning<\/h4>     <p>T<small>HIS APPEARS TO BE<\/small> the fourth of the oracles in the sequence beginning with the oracle \u201cconcerning the Desert by the Sea\u201d in 21:1. Like two of the other three, its title is enigmatic, and it is also marked by the prophet\u2019s grief over what he sees as about to take place (21:3\u2013 4; 22:4, 12). Given these two similarities and recognizing that the second and third oracles seem to be related to the fall of Babylon, most likely this one is related in the same way. Judah is rejoicing in the help that Babylon can give in the fight against Assyria, but Isaiah weeps as he sees that not only will Babylon give no help, but it will eventually be the cause of Judah\u2019s destruction.<\/p>     ",
