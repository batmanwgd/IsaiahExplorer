    "html": " <p> <i>The dead shall not live.<\/i>, The Prophet again speaks of the unhappy end of the wicked, whose prosperity often agitates and vexes us, as we read in the Psalms of David. (<a class=\"ref\">Psalms 37:1<\/a>.) That our eyes may not be dazzled by the present appearances of things, he foretells that their end will be very miserable. Others interpret this passage as relating to believers, who appear to die without any hope of a resurrection; but unquestionably he speaks of the reprobate, and this will be still more evident from an opposite statement which he makes at the nineteenth verse. There is a contrast between the resurrection of good men and wicked men, between whom there would be little difference, were it not evident that the latter are sentenced to eternal death, and that the former will receive a blessed and everlasting life: and not only does eternal death await the wicked, but all the sufferings which they endure in this world are the commencement of everlasting destruction; for they cannot be soothed by any consolation, and they feel that God is their enemy. <\/p>\n <p> <i>The slain shall not rise again.<\/i>, The word which we render <i>slain<\/i>, is rendered by others <i>giants<\/i>,; but as in many passages of Scripture <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05e8\u05e4\u05d0\u05d9\u05dd<\/span>,(<i>r\u0115ph\u0101\u012bm <\/i>) denotes <i>slain<\/i>, so also in this passage it will be more appropriate, for otherwise there would be no contrast. (<a class=\"ref\">Psalms 88:11<\/a>.) <\/p>\n <p> <i>Therefore hast thou visited and destroyed them.<\/i>, This is added for the sake of explanation; for it assigns the reason why the reprobate perish without hope, namely, because it is the purpose of God to destroy them. In the wrath of God they have nothing to look for but death and ruin. <\/p>",
