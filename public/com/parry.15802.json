    "html": " <p>When Israel is gathered, she will come forth in joy and peace (55:12). Even nature will join in the rejoicing as the children of Israel pass by (55:12). The land will produce pleasant plants instead of briers and thorns (55:12). These conditions appear to be the millennial reversal of the physical conditions of the Fall, a return to the paradisiacal earth. They may also be symbolic, meaning that all things will work together for the blessing of those who fully come unto Christ and his kingdom.<\/p> <blockquote>For ye shall <i>go out <\/i><u>with joy<\/u><i>,<\/i>     <br>and be <i>led forth <\/i><u>with peace<\/u>:     <br>the <i>mountains and the hills<\/i> shall<u> break forth before you into singing<\/u><i>,<\/i>     <br>and all the <i>trees of the field<\/i> shall <u>clap their hands<\/u><i>.<\/i> (55:12)     <br><i>Instead of the thorn<\/i><u> shall come up the fir tree<\/u>,     <br>and <i>instead of the brier <\/i><u>shall come up the myrtle tree<\/u><i>:<\/i>     <br>and it shall be to the Lord for a <i>name,<\/i>     <br>for an <i>everlasting sign<\/i> that shall not be cut off.
