One aspect of the Lord's mortal mission was to open the eyes of the children of Israel to the truth of the everlasting covenant and to extend that truth to the Gentiles. (Prophets, including Isaiah, also serve God in this capacity.) By abiding by the everlasting covenant and receiving all the blessings of the Atonement, men are <i>made perfect<\/i> despite their blindness. Concerning this prophecy Elder Bruce R. McConkie wrote: \"Truly this is what has been and is transpiring in this day. The scattered remnants of Israel, hearing again the voice of their Shepherd, are believing his gospel, accepting baptism at the hands of his servants,&hellip;taking upon themselves his name, and once again becoming his sons and his daughters.\" <\/p> ",
