So did the Egyptians, Canaanites, Philistines, and every other nation against whom Jehovah empowered his servants. Relying on each other&mdash;on an arm of flesh instead of on Jehovah (cf. <a class=\"ref\">2 Chronicles 32:7-8<\/a>)&mdash;idolaters, including those of Jehovah&rsquo;s people, repudiate his help: &ldquo;Who would fashion a god or cast an idol that cannot benefit them? Their whole society is confused; their fabricators are mere mortals. Were they all to assemble and take their stand [before me], they would at once cringe in fear&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg1NDQiOjJ9XQ==\">Isaiah 44:10-11<\/a>; cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg1ODIiOjJ9XQ==\">45:20-21<\/a>).<\/p>",
