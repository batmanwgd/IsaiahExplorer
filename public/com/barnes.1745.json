    "html": " <p> <em>Can a woman forget her sucking child? <\/em>&mdash;The design of this verse is apparent. It is to show that the love which God has for his people is stronger than that which is produced by the most tender ties created by any natural relation. The love of a mother for her infant child is the strongest attachment in nature. The question here implies that it was unusual for a mother to be unmindful of that tie, and to forsake the child that she should nourish and love. <\/p> <p> <em>That she should not have compassion <\/em>&mdash;That she should not pity and succor it in times of sickness and distress; that she should see it suffer without any attempt to relieve it, and turn away, and see it die unpitied and unalleviated. <\/p> <p> <em>Yea, they may forget <\/em>&mdash;They will sooner forget their child than God will forget his afflicted and suffering people. The phrase &lsquo;they may forget,&rsquo; implies that such a thing may occur. In pagan lands, strong as is the instinct which binds a mother to her offspring, it has not been uncommon for a mother to expose her infant child, and to leave it to die. In illustration of this fact, see the notes at <a class=\"ref\">Romans 1:31<\/a>. <\/p> ",
