The prophet has not forgotten the daughters of Zion. Jehovah will wash away, as with the baptism of repentance, the \u201cfilth,\u201d the moral uncleanness, that lay beneath their outward show of beauty. The \u201cblood of Jerusalem,\u201d in the next verse, has a wide range of meaning, from the \u201cmurders\u201d of <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 1:15<\/a>; <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 1:21<\/a>, to the Moloch sacrifices in which the women had borne a conspicuous part (<a class=\"ref\">Psalms 106:38<\/a>; <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIyMDk3OSI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 57:5; Ezekiel 22:2-3<\/a>).<\/p>\n <p>By the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of burning.\u2014The word for \u201cspirit\u201d is better taken in its more literal meaning, as breath or blast, as in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 30:27-28<\/a>; <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 40:7<\/a>. The words indicate that the prophet saw in the \u201cblood\u201d of which he speaks a greater enormity than that of the daughters of Zion. The one might be washed away. The other needed, as it were, the \u201cfiery baptism\u201d of the wrath of Jehovah. (Comp. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 30:27<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\">Matthew 3:11<\/a>.) The Authorised Version \u201cburning\u201d represents the root-meaning of the word, but it is elsewhere (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzUyNzgsNTM3Ml0=\">Isaiah 6:13; Deuteronomy 13:5; Deuteronomy 17:7<\/a>) used for \u201cdestruction\u201d generally.<\/p>",
