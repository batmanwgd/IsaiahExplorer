It was, 1st, For Israel\u2019s sake: For <i>Israel, mine elect, I have even called thee, <\/i> &c.\u2014I have called thee to this honour, and that by name; not for thy own sake, but for Israel\u2019s sake: therefore, neither despise them, though a poor and despised people, nor be puffed up in a great opinion of thyself. <i>I have surnamed thee, though thou hast not known me <\/i>\u2014I knew and called thee, when thou didst neither know nor think of me; nay, when thou hadst no being. <i>I girded thee, <\/i> &c.\u2014I made thee strong and active, and fitted and disposed thee for these great and warlike enterprises. It was, 2d, For the sake of all nations; that they might be convinced of the true divinity and almighty power of the God of Israel. <i>That they may know from the rising of the sun, &c., that I am the Lord, <\/i> &c.\u2014That all nations may know it by my foretelling these things so long before, and by the wonderful success that I shall give thee, and by my overruling thy heart and counsels, to the deliverance of my people. Or, as Lowth explains it, \u201cMy interposing so visibly in behalf of my own people, and returning their captivity by such unexpected means, will convince the heathen part of the world that I am the only true God.\u201d <\/p> ",
