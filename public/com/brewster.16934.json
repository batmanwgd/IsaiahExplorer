The author has previously suggested that \"this highway could be a literal road whereon the returning tribes will travel; it could [also] be symbolic of a highway of holiness (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MzI5XQ==\">Isa. 35:8<\/a>), which one scholar has identified as the strait and narrow path (Mill M, 327); or a combination of the two pathways.\" (DCE, 590.)<\/p>     <p>Whatever this highway will be, it will be a clear road or means of transportation whereby the Lord's people will find their way to His promised destination. Certainly the Lord's hand will be in the matter.<\/p>",
