    "html": "<p>When Jehovah intervenes in humanity&rsquo;s affairs the entire situation of his people changes. A great reversal of circumstances occurs between the righteous and the wicked, including their places of habitation: &ldquo;I will lay waste mountains and hills and make all their vegetation wither&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDk2XQ==\">Isaiah 42:15<\/a>); &ldquo;Wilderness and arid land shall be jubilant; the desert shall rejoice when it blossoms like the crocus&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MzIyXQ==\">Isaiah 35:1<\/a>). As symbolized by their lands, the &ldquo;fruitfulness&rdquo; of the wicked is then seen as unfruitful, and what some considered the unfruitfulness of the righteous then appears fruitful (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODgzNSI6M30=\">Isaiah 60:13-15<\/a>).<\/p>",
