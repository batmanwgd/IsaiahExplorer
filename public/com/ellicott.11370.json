Strictly speaking, Sargon, the father of Sennacherib, was the founder of a new dynasty; but the \u201cfathers\u201d are, as commonly in the formul\u00e6 of Eastern kings, the predecessors of the reigning king. The position of Gozan is defined by <a class=\"ref\">2 Kings 17:6<\/a> as being on the Habor, or Khab\u00fbr, which flows into the Tigris from the east, above Mosul. Haran is probably identical with Abraham\u2019s resting-place (<a class=\"ref\">Genesis 11:31<\/a>), and the Charran of Josephus and St. Stephen\u2019s speech (<a class=\"ref\">Acts 7:4<\/a>). \u201cRezeph\u201d is identified with the Rhesepher of Ptolemy (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzUzXQ==\">Isaiah 5:13<\/a>; <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzQ2XQ==\">Isaiah 5:6<\/a>) below Thapeacus, between the \u2019Euphrates and Tadmor (= Palmyra). Telassar is probably an altered form of Tel-Assur (the hill of Assur), and was probably a new name given to a conquered city, after the manner in which Shalmaneser records that he gave names to cities that he had taken belonging to Akhuni, the son of Adini (Records of the Past, iii. 87, v. 30). In the patronymic we may trace the sons of Eden of this verse. In <a class=\"ref\">Amos 1:5<\/a> we have a Beth-Eden named as connected with Damascus; and in <a class=\"ref\">Ezekiel 27:23<\/a> an \u201cEden\u201d connected with Haran and Asshur, as carrying on traffic with Tyre. The latter is probably identical with that named by Sennacherib.<\/p>",
