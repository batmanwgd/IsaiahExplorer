Together with our Israelite ancestors, we are recipients of the Master's concern and love. If we become like plump, juicy, sweet grapes, it is because the Master has planted us in a fertile hill, removed stones and weeds, and prepared us for the harvest.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>The final five verses of this chapter describe the missionary work of our day and the gathering of the nations around the gospel banner. All members of the Church who do their part in the great missionary effort of this dispensation are assisting in the fulfillment of this prophecy of Isaiah.<\/i><\/p> ",
