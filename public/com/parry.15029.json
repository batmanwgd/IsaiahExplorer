That city sat on a hot and dusty plain in the Euphrates valley, but anciently, before flood-control dams were built, the whole plain was flooded each spring during the high-water runoff of the Euphrates. Thus, Babylon sat both in a desert and on a sea. <\/p> <p><i>whirlwinds in the south.<\/i> Destruction will come upon Babylon with a speed and force comparable to the whirlwinds that arise in the desert area known as the Negev.<\/p> <p><i>terrible land.<\/i> Isaiah calls Elam and Media the <i>terrible land<\/i> because of the extremely cruel nature of their leaders and armies. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzkyNCI6Mn0=\">Isa. 13:17-18<\/a> describes the Medes as people who love warfare for the sake of warring and killing, rather than for the rich booty it brings.<\/p> ",
