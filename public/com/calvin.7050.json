The picture is still further heightened by adding, that the desolation will be so great that<i> in that place neither will the Arabians pitch their tents, nor the shepherds their folds<\/i> That place must have been marvellously forsaken and uncultivated, when it was disregarded by those roving tribes; for the<i> Arabians<\/i> were a wandering and unsettled nation, and had no fixed abode. Having left their native country, because it was barren, and is therefore called Arabia<i> Deserta<\/i> , (for it is of that country that we speak,) they devoted themselves to feeding flocks and to hunting, and wandered without any fixed residence; for which reason also the Greeks called them<span class=\"greek-hebrew\"> \u03c3\u03ba\u03b7\u03bd\u1f75\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9<\/span> , (<i> skenetai<\/i> ,)<i> dwellers in tents<\/i> . Now the country around Babylon was exceedingly fertile before that calamity, which rendered this change the more astonishing and almost miraculous, either because the place lost its former fertility, or because the constant slaughter made all men abhor the sight of it. Undoubtedly the Prophet means that not only will the buildings be thrown down, but the very soil will be accursed.<\/p> ",
