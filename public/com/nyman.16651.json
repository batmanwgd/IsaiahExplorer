These too will face the destructive justice and judgment of the Lord as he cleanses his own house (see <a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 112:24-26<\/a>). However, those who have kept their covenants will have great blessings in contrast to the destruction which will come upon the wicked element of Israel.<\/p>     ",
