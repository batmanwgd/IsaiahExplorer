For them to shake or move indicates significant changes in the earth, but there shall be no changes in the Lord's kindness, his mercy, or his covenant.<\/p> <p><i>my kindness.<\/i> The Revised Standard Version reads \"my steadfast love.\"<\/p> <p><i>covenant of my people. <\/i>The Joseph Smith Translation changes the <i>peace<\/i> in this phrase to <i>people,<\/i> underscoring that the Lord's covenant is indeed with his children. The expression <i>my people<\/i> suggests a relationship and a bond between God and us.<\/p> <p> At the same time, <a class=\"ref\">3 Ne. 22:10<\/a> retains the wording found in the King James Version: \"covenant of my peace.\" With that reading, the phrase refers to the Lord's everlasting promise to give us peace (of heart, of soul) when we come unto him. The covenant of peace, and the covenant of \"my people,\" is the covenant of the gospel (<a class=\"ref\">Lev. 26:3-6; Ps. 29:11<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\"> 85:8; Ezek. 37:26<\/a>). <\/p> ",
