The same idea is contained in the phrase <i>shall be for a sanctuary <\/i>(8:14). Peter and Nephi used similar language: \"But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts\" (<a class=\"ref\">1 Pet. 3:15<\/a>) and \"they shall sanctify my name, and sanctify the Holy One of Jacob\" (<a class=\"ref\">2 Ne. 27:34<\/a>). <\/p> <p><i>let him be your fear\/dread.<\/i> The Israelites should not fear the Assyrian empire's temporal might and power; instead they should place their attention and fear on the Lord, who possesses everlasting might. To fear the Lord is to honor, revere, trust, and obey him.<\/p> ",
