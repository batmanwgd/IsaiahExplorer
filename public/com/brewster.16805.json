    "html": "<p>Perhaps the main message of this chapter is that we must trust in God and His promises of protection in spite of the threats of mortals. Isaiah sought unsuccessfully to teach this to Ahaz, king of Judah. At this time, the southern king-dom of Judah was threatened by an alliance of the northern kingdom of Israel with Syria. The kings of these two coun-tries wanted Ahaz to join them in an alliance against the Assyrians, but the king of Judah decided to cast his lot with the Assyrians.<\/p>     <p>In verse 3, the Lord sends Isaiah to counsel Ahaz against entering any alliances; instead, he is to depend on the protection of the God of Israel. Isaiah prophesies that the threat from the northern kingdom and from Syria will come to naught and that these two countries will be the ones that will be destroyed.<\/p>     <p>The Lord offers to give the disbelieving Ahaz a sign of the verity of His words, but the king refuses to ask for confirmation of the prophecy. The Lord gives the king a sign anyway: a sign involving the future birth of the Messiah through the house of David.<\/p>     <p>Because of rejecting divine counsel, Judah suffers consequences that could have been avoided. The people are oppressed, scattered, and taken into slavery. The once-fertile lands are left barren of crops and become useful only for wandering animals.<\/p>",
