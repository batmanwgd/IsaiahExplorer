    "html": "<p>There is no general agreement among scholars about the meaning of &ldquo;beasts,&rdquo; &ldquo;watchmen,&rdquo; &ldquo;dogs,&rdquo; and &ldquo;shepherds&rdquo; mentioned in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODc2MyI6NH0=\">Isaiah 56:9&ndash;12<\/a>. The beasts devour, the watchmen are blind, the dogs are mute and greedy, and the shepherds are without understanding. In a latter-day context, which this seems to be, these figures may point to the Gentiles who reject the gospel when it is presented to them and seek to have others do the same. This passage may also refer to those who have the gospel (watch over the flock) but do not make it available to others.<\/p><p>&ldquo;Kimchi observes, &lsquo;The flock is intrusted to the care of these watchmen. The wild beasts come; these dogs bark not; and the wild beasts devour the flock. Thus they do not<em>profit<\/em> the flock. Yea, they<em>injure<\/em> it; for the owner trusts in them, that they will watch and be faithful; but they are not. These are the false teachers and careless shepherds.&rsquo;&rdquo; (Adam Clarke, <em>The Holy Bible &hellip; with a Commentary and Critical Notes,<\/em> 4:212.)<\/p><p>These words are an apt description of the Christian world of the last days.
