Shrubs cover its open spaces (perhaps the prophet thinks of the gardens and parks within the walls of a city like Babylon), and women come, without fear of trespassing, to gather them for firewood. <\/p>\n <p>For it is a people of no understanding.\u2014The words are generic enough, and may be applied, like similar words in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NjU4XQ==\">Isaiah 1:3<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 8:7; Deuteronomy 32:28<\/a>, to Israel as apostate, or to the world-power, which was the enemy of Israel. In this case, as we have seen, the context turns the scale in favour of the latter reference. So taken, the words are suggestive, as witnessing to the prophet\u2019s belief that the God of Israel was also the Maker and the Former of the nations of the heathen world. <\/p>",
