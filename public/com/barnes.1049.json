    "html": "<p><em>For the Lord of hosts<\/em>&mdash;(see the note at <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NjY0XQ==\">Isaiah 1:9<\/a> ).<\/p><p><em>Who shall disannul it?<\/em>&mdash;Who has power to defeat his purposes? Difficult as they may be in appearance, and incredible as their fulfillment may seem, yet his purposes are formed in full view of all the circumstances; and there is no power to resist his arm, or to turn him aside from the execution of his designs. By this assurance God designed to comfort his people when they should be in Babylon in a long and dreary captivity (compare <a class=\"ref\">Psalm 137:1-9<\/a>.) And by the same consideration his people may be comforted at all times. His plans shall stand. None can disannul them. No arm has power to resist him. None of the schemes formed against him shall ever prosper. Whatever ills, therefore, may befall his people; however thick, and gloomy, and sad their calamities may be; and however dark his dispensations may appear, yet they may bare the assurance that all his plans are wise, and that they all shall stand. No matter how many, or how mighty may be the foes of the church; no matter how strong their cities, or their ramparts; no matter how numerous their armies, or how self-confident may be their leaders, they have no power to resist God. If their plans are in his way they will be thrown down; if revolutions are necessary among human beings to accomplish His purposes, they will be brought about; if cities and armies need to be destroyed in order that &ldquo;his&rdquo; plans may succeed, and his church be safe, they will be demolished, just as the army of Sennacherib was laid pale in death, and as Babylon&mdash;the haughtiest of cities&mdash;was overthrown. Who can stand against God? and who can resist the execution of his will?<\/p>",
