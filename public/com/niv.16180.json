Instead of the silent and ruined city of the earth (26:5), there is now the city of God, peopled with the faithful singing his praises (26:1\u20132). This city has the \u201csalvation\u201d of God for \u201cwalls,\u201d making it plain that it is a state of mind more than a geographical place. Instead of the closed gates of a city fearful of attack, it has the open gates of confidence. But the gates are not open to everyone. They are open to those who choose to live in the ethical righteousness of the covenant. As in Psalm 15:1\u20135; 24:3\u201310; 118:19\u201320, the key is not ritual purity but a kind of behavior that mirrors that of the King. One is able to behave in this way because of a complete inner integrity (Heb. \u0161alom) that stems from complete dependence on God: \u201ctrust\u201d (Isa. 26:3).<\/p>     <p>\u2003Once again, the main theme of this entire subdivision (chs. 7\u201339) is trust in the Lord, not in the nations. This trust is eminently justified because the Lord is as secure as a \u201crock\u201d that is \u201ceternal\u201d (26:4) and because he will bring the \u201clofty city\u201d of earth down into the dust (26:5\u20136). The Lord is the eternal Rock, whereas the city, the symbol of all earthly power, is crushed into dust. Ultimately, the city will be brought down by the very people who were oppressed by it. God puts the high and the mighty under the humble and lowly. Since the meek will inherit the earth (Ps. 37:11), it makes no sense to put one\u2019s faith in the mighty of the earth.<\/p>     ",
