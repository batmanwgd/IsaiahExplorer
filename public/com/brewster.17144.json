    "html": "<p>The chapter begins with an appeal to the children of Israel to remember their heritage and to follow the righteous example of their progenitors, Abraham and Sarah. The promises God made to these grand heads of Israel's people are still in force. While the heavens and the earth may pass away, the Lord's promises and covenants will abide forever. But the people must qualify for the promised blessings through their obedience and righteousness.<\/p>     <p>Because of her long dispersion and persecution, Israel calls upon the Lord to intervene in her behalf and use the power He used anciently in defeating Rahab and the dragon. The Lord responds by reminding Israel that He will protect and comfort her and she need not fear any man. \"Thou art my people,\" He declares.<\/p>     <p>Two great prophets are promised specifically to the house of Judah in the last days. They shall prophesy and protect the people for a season (three and one-half years) before their ministry is complete and their enemies slay them. Nevertheless, in the end, God's purposes will be fulfilled and His people will be redeemed.<\/p>",
