Righteous government, as a blessing for the people, is the first beneficent fruit.<i> \u201cBehold, the king will reign according to righteousness; and the princes, according to right will they command. And every one will be like a shelter from the wind, and a covert from the storm; like water-brooks in a dry place, like the shadow of a gigantic rock in a languishing land.\u201d<\/i> The kingdom of Asshur is for ever destroyed; but the kingdom of Judah rises out of the state of confusion into which it has fallen through its God - forgetting policy and disregard of justice. King and princes now rule according to the standards that have been divinely appointed and revealed. The<i> Lamed<\/i> in<i> (<span class=\"translit\"> u\u0304lesa\u0302r\u0131\u0304m<\/span>) (and the princes) is that of reference (<i> quod attinet ad<\/i> , as in<a class=\"ref\"><\/a> and<a class=\"ref\"><\/a>), the exponent of the usual<i> casus abs.<\/i> (<i> Ges<\/i> . \u00a7146, 2); and the two other<i> Lameds<\/i> are equivalent to<span class=\"greek normal\"> \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u0301<\/span> , secundum<\/i> (as in<a class=\"ref\"><\/a>). The figures in<a class=\"ref\"><\/a> are the same as in<a class=\"ref\"><\/a> . The rock of Asshur (i.e., Sennacherib) has departed, and the princes of Asshur have deserted their standards, merely to save themselves. The king and princes of Judah are now the defence of their nation, and overshadow it like colossal walls of rock. This is the first fruit of the blessing.<br><\/p> ",
