And&hellip;God divided the light from the darkness\" (<a class=\"ref\">Gen. 1:3-4<\/a>). Jehovah says he is above both light and darkness, having created them (<a class=\"ref\">Ezek. 32:8<\/a>). <\/p> <p><i>create evil.<\/i> Certainly the Lord is not the originator of evil; that is made clear in <a class=\"ref\">Moro. 7:12<\/a>: \"That which is evil cometh of the devil.\" But <i>evil<\/i> can also mean \"ill fortune, trial, or difficulty.\" As the New International Version says, \"I bring prosperity and create disaster.\" Job gave expression to this idea of the duality of God's power when he said, \"Shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil?\" (<a class=\"ref\">Job 2:10<\/a>). As the New International Version puts it: \"Shall we accept good from God, and not trouble?\" The point of 45:6-7 seems to be that God is in charge: he has power over all things and directs the affairs of men to their ultimate good.<\/p> ",
