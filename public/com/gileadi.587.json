    "html": "<p>Parallelism of the &ldquo;followers of righteousness&rdquo; and &ldquo;seekers of Jehovah&rdquo; resembles the parallelism of those who fear Jehovah and heed the voice of his servant ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NjczXQ==\">Isaiah 50:10<\/a>). In effect, those who seek Jehovah are those live righteously and love Jehovah&rsquo;s<em>righteousness<\/em>&mdash;his servant ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODQ1NF0seyIxODU5OCI6M31d\">Isaiah 41:2; 46:11-13<\/a>). Contrasting the many who reject the servant, therefore ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODY0NF0seyIxODY2OSI6NH0sWzE4Njc0XV0=\">Isaiah 49:7; 50:6-9, 11<\/a>), are those who accept him. Just as Abraham &ldquo;was but one&rdquo; when Jehovah called him, however&mdash;unlike the idolatrous society from which he came&mdash;so the followers of righteousness are but one here and one there.<\/p><p>Those who respond to Jehovah&rsquo;s call to come out of Greater Babylon in the new exodus ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg0NjAiOjJ9LHsiMTg1MTEiOjR9LHsiMTg1MjAiOjR9LHsiMTg2MzUiOjJ9LHsiMTg2NDYiOjR9LFsxODY1OV0seyIxODcwOCI6Mn1d\">Isaiah 41:8-9; 43:5-8, 14-17; 48:20-21; 49:9-12, 22; 52:11-12<\/a>) resemble their progenitors Abraham and Sarah&mdash;the<em>rock<\/em> and<em>quarry<\/em> . Although Abraham and Sarah, too, were lone individuals, Jehovah multiplied them into &ldquo;many nations&rdquo; and &ldquo;kings&rdquo; as a covenant blessing ( <a class=\"ref\">Genesis 17:1-9, 15-16<\/a>; cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg2NTkiOjJ9LHsiMTg4MjUiOjl9LFsxODg0NF1d\">Isaiah 49:22-23; 60:3-11, 22<\/a>). On a primary level, moreover, the<em>rock<\/em> identifies Jehovah himself ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3OTk0LDE4MTM1LDE4MjQ3LDE4NTQyXQ==\">Isaiah 17:10; 26:4; 30:29; 44:8<\/a>) while the<em>quarry<\/em> is his bride ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg1NzIiOjJ9LHsiMTg3MjUiOjE0fSx7IjE4ODU2Ijo1fSx7IjE4OTMwIjo1fV0=\">Isaiah 45:10-11; 54:1-14; 62:1-5; 66:7-11<\/a>).<\/p> ",
