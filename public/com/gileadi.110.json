    "html": " <p>The exhortation to remain &ldquo;calm and unafraid&rdquo; implies trust in Jehovah and in the protection clause of the Davidic Covenant. Divine protection never fails so long as the terms of the covenant are met when the people keep the king&rsquo;s law and the king keeps God&rsquo;s law. The rulers of Aram and the Northern Kingdom are but &ldquo;smoking tail ends of kindling&rdquo;&mdash;their fires are almost out. Jehovah will make sure they won&rsquo;t accomplish their goal. Instead of Pekah king of Israel appearing by his full name, he appears only under his surname&mdash;&ldquo;the son of Remaliah&rdquo;&mdash;an intentional derogatory deficiency. <\/p> ",
