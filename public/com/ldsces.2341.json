    "html": "<p>When Israel is restored, she &ldquo;shall blossom and bud, and fill the face of the world with fruit&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgxNTgiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 27:6<\/a>). That fruit is the gospel of peace (see <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgxNTciOjJ9XQ==\">vv. 5&ndash;6<\/a>). At the same time the Lord &ldquo;shall punish leviathan the piercing serpent, &hellip; and he shall slay the dragon&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgxNTMiOjF9XQ==\">v. 1<\/a>). Both dragon and serpent are scriptural terms for Satan, the common enemy of God and all mankind (see <a class=\"ref\">Revelation 12:9<\/a>). Thus, <em>leviathan<\/em> probably includes not only Satan personally but all who serve him. In other words, what Isaiah saw is the necessary destruction of Babylon, or the world, before Zion can be fully established. Here again, as in <a class=\"ref\">chapter 26<\/a>, Isaiah is so taken with the joy of that future day that he couches his words in a hymn of praise.<\/p><p class=\"cite\">LDS Church Educational System Old Testament Student Manual, 1 Kings&ndash;Malachi, Religion 302, Chapter 15, Item 9<\/p>",
