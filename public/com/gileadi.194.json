    "html": " <p>Those who inherit &ldquo;the land of Jehovah&rdquo;&mdash;which, in a millennial context, becomes &ldquo;their own place&rdquo;&mdash;are escorted home by Jehovah&rsquo;s servants from among the nations. Just as Joseph ministered to his brothers in the land of Egypt and saved them from the curse of a famine, so certain spiritual kings and queens of the Gentiles minister to Jehovah&rsquo;s people and escort them in a new exodus to Zion (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg2NTkiOjJ9LHsiMTg4MjUiOjEwfV0=\">Isaiah 49:22-23; 60:3-12 <\/a>). In a second exodus&mdash;after Jehovah has instituted his reign of peace on the earth&mdash;those who are thus gathered gather up the remaining remnants of his people (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODk0MSI6NH0=\">Isaiah 66:18-21 <\/a>). <\/p> <p> <em>They will take captive their captors and rule over their oppressors. <\/em> Different spiritual categories&mdash;of both Jehovah&rsquo;s people and the nations&mdash;exist side by side through the end-time and into Jehovah&rsquo;s millennial reign of peace. The fact that all of the earth&rsquo;s wicked perish in Jehovah&rsquo;s Day of Judgment and only those who repent of transgression survive doesn&rsquo;t preclude the survival of some former captors and oppressors of Jehovah&rsquo;s people or their descendants. Many will convert to Israel&rsquo;s God and serve him by serving his elect as they learn his ways (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxNzY4OV0seyIxNzc1NiI6Mn0sWzE4NTc2LDE4ODM0LDE4ODM2XSx7IjE4ODQ5IjoyfV0=\">Isaiah 2:3; 5:16-17; 45:14; 60:12, 14; 61:5-6 <\/a>). <\/p> ",
