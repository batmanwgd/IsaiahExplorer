    "html": "<p>The theme of punishment is abruptly dropped in verses 18-21, in which the Lord sends forth his servants to gather all nations to see his glory:<\/p> <p><sup>18<\/sup> \"And I, because of their actions and their imaginations, am about to come and gather all nations and tongues, and they will come and see my glory.<\/p> <p><sup>19<\/sup> \"I will set a sign among them, and I will send some of those who survive to the nations\u2014to Tarshish, to the Libyans and Lydians (famous as archers), to Tubal and Greece, and to the distant islands, that have not heard of my fame or seen my glory. They will proclaim my glory among the nations. 20And they will bring all your brothers, from all the nations, to my holy mountain in Jerusalem as an offering to the Lord\u2014on horses, in chariots and wagons, and mules and camels,\" says the Lord. \"They will bring them, as the Israelites bring their grain offerings, to the temple of the Lord in ceremonially clean vessels. 21And I will select some of them also to be priests and Levites,\" says the Lord. (NIV)<\/p> <p>The names in verse 19 refer to such places as modern Spain, Libya, Turkey, and Greece. (See Map 10.) These countries were considered to be the ends of the earth in Isaiah's day. Thus, he prophesies that the Lord's word will go to all the nations of the earth.<\/p> <p>Verse 20 is amplified in <a class=\"ref\">Doctrine and Covenants 128<\/a>. An \"offering\" in \"clean vessels\" seems symbolic of the names of the dead for whom the righteous do vicarious work in the last days. These names are brought from all over the world to the temples.<\/p>",
