It may be divided into two parts. The first part, in the first four verses, contains a confirmation and sign of the prediction concerning the sudden subversion of the kingdoms of Syria and Israel. The second part more fully and distinctly explains the purpose of God with respect both to the Israelites and Jews, for the consolation of the pious, and the terror of the impious and carnal, among them.\u201d<i> Take thee a great roll<\/i> \u2014 Or,<i> a great volume,<\/i> because the prophecy to be written in it was large: and God would have it written in very large and legible characters;<i> and write in it with a man\u2019s pen<\/i> \u2014 With such a pen as writers use, that so all may read and understand it.

Accordingly, he renders the word<span class=\"hebrew_text\"> \u05d7\u05e8\u05e9\u05c2<\/span> , which we translate a<i> pen,<\/i> a<i> graving tool.<\/i> \u201cIn this manner,\u201d says he, \u201cthe prophet was to record the prophecy of the destruction of Damascus and Samaria by the Assyrians: the subject and sum of which prophecy are here expressed, with great brevity, in four words,<i> maher, shalal, hash, baz;<\/i> that is,<i> to hasten the spoil, to take quickly the prey:<\/i> which was afterward applied as the name of the prophet\u2019s son, who was made a sign of the speedy completion of it;<i> Haste-to-the-spoil, Quick-to-the-prey.<\/i> And that it might be done with the greater solemnity, and to preclude all doubt of the real delivery of the prophecy before the event, he calls witnesses to attest the recording of it.\u201d<i> Concerning Maher-shalal-hash-baz<\/i> \u2014 Concerning that thing which is signified by the name of the child, which is here mentioned by way of anticipation, as not being given him till<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODExXQ==\">Isaiah 8:3<\/a> ; that is, concerning that which God is making haste to do, the giving up Syria and Israel for a prey to the Assyrians.<\/p> ",
