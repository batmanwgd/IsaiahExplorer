    "html": " <i>isles shall wait for me.<\/i> <i>Isles<\/i> refers at least partly to the land of America, as we learn from <a class=\"ref\">2 Ne. 10:20<\/a>: \"The Lord has made the sea our path, and we are upon an isle of the sea.\" <i>Isles<\/i> also represent the uttermost parts of the earth\u2014in this context, the people around the world. <i>Wait for me<\/i> indicates a desire to obey and to patiently do God's will. The verb used here, <i>qavah,<\/i> also means \"to gather.\"<\/p> <p><i>ships of Tarshish.<\/i> These were the merchant ships, often used to carry metals (including precious metals), from the Phoenician port of Tartessus (see commentary on 2:16; 23:1). The symbolism is that the Lord will provide means to enable the covenant people\u2014and their wealth\u2014to gather to Zion.<\/p> <p><i>first.<\/i> Some translations render this word as \"as at first\" or \"as in former days.\" As the Lord provided means for Israel to come to the promised land anciently, so will he help the people of his covenant to come to Zion at the last.<\/p> ",
