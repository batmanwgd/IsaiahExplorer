    "html": "<p><em>Therefore, thus saith the Lord God<\/em> &mdash;The design of this verse is to show what would be the difference between those who kept and those who forsook his commandments. The one would be objects of his favor, and have abundance; the other would be objects of his displeasure, and be subjected to the evils of poverty, grief, and want.<\/p><p><em>My servants shall eat<\/em> &mdash;Shall have abundance. They shall be objects of my favor.<\/p><p><em>But ye<\/em> &mdash;Ye who revolt from me, and who worship idols.<\/p><p><em>Shall be hungry<\/em> &mdash;Shall be subjected to the evils of want. The idea is, that the one should partake of his favor; the other should be punished.<\/p> ",
