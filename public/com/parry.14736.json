The Lord commanded Isaiah to take Shear-jashub with him to meet King Ahaz at the upper pool because the boy was to become a living symbol to the Jews (8:18) and a reminder to the Israelites that a remnant would return to their land and their God (6:11-13).<\/p> <p><i>aqueduct of the upper pool.<\/i> The pool was probably located near the Gihon spring in the Valley of Kidron. Ahaz may have been at the pool with his officers to check Jerusalem's water supply for the pending siege. The Lord, who knew Ahaz's location, inspired Isaiah to go there with his son Shear-jashub. This is also the place where Rabshakeh, messenger of the king of Assyria, delivered a message to King Hezekiah (36:2; <a class=\"ref\">2 Kgs. 18:17<\/a>). <\/p> ",
