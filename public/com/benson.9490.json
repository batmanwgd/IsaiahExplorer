Or, thy children shall be so numerous that they can no longer be contained within narrow bounds. <i>And thy seed <\/i>\u2014Thy spiritual seed, the members of the New Testament church, and especially the apostles and other ministers of Christ; <i>shall inherit the Gentiles <\/i>\u2014Shall bring the Gentile world to the obedience of the faith; <i>and make the desolate cities to be inhabited <\/i>\u2014Shall cause those cities and countries which, in a spiritual sense, were desolate, being destitute of all good, to be filled with members of the church. <\/p>",
