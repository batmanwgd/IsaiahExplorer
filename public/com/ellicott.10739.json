It is noticeable that the prophet does not address the king. It may be that he trusted him, but not his ministers. We have to remember that the rulers (better, judges; same word as kadi) thus addressed were probably those who were outwardly active in Hezekiah\u2019s work of reformation, or had taken part in the older routine worship under Uzziah. For princes and people alike that reformation was but superficial. The priestly writer of the Book of Chronicles might dwell only on the apparent good in either reign (<a class=\"ref\">2 Chronicles 27:2<\/a>; 2 Chronicles 29-31); but the eye of Isaiah saw below the surface. In \u201cthe word of the Lord,\u201d and \u201cthe law of our God,\u201d we have two different aspects of the revelation of the Divine will, the first being the prophetic message of the prophet, the second pointing primarily, perhaps, to the law given by Moses, but including also, as in <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 19:7; Psalms 119:1<\/a>; <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDg1LDE4NTA1LDE4NjgxXQ==\">Isaiah 42:4; Isaiah 42:24; Isaiah 51:7<\/a>, all forms of direct ethical teaching, especially, perhaps, such as were actually based upon the law or Torah as a text. <\/p>",
