The idea in this verse is, that it was an occasion on which the heavens and the earth would have cause to exult together. It is common in Isaiah thus to interpose a song of praise on the announcement of any great and glorious truth, and to call on the heavens and the earth to rejoice together (see the notes at <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc5MDIiOjZ9LHsiMTg0OTEiOjJ9XQ==\">Isaiah 12:1-6; Isaiah 42:10-11<\/a> ; <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NTU3XQ==\">Isaiah 44:23<\/a> ).<\/p>",
