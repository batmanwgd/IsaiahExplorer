The ritually clean nature of the animals&mdash;lambs, he-goats, rams, buffalo, bulls, and steers&mdash;identifies them as Jehovah&rsquo;s apostate people: &ldquo;I will destine you to the sword; all of you shall succumb to the slaughter. For when I called, you did not respond; when I spoke, you would not give heed. You did what was evil in my eyes; you chose to do what was not my will&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4OTEwXQ==\">Isaiah 65:12<\/a> ; cf.<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODg2OCI6Nn0=\">63:1-6<\/a>).<\/p> ",
