    "html": "<p> It was necessary that the worthlessness of the help of Egypt should be placed in this way before the eyes of the people. <em> \u201cFor it is a refractory people, lying children, children who do not like to hear the instruction of Jehovah, who say to the seers, See not; and to the prophets, Prophesy not unto us right things! Speak flatteries to us! Get out of the way, turn aside from the path, remove from our face the Holy One of Israel.\u201d<\/em> On the expression <em> \u201bam m e r\u0131\u0304 <\/em> (a people of stubbornness), see at <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzE2XQ==\">Isaiah 3:8<\/a>. The vowel-pointing of \u05db\u05d7\u05e9\u05c1\u05d4\u05d9\u05dd follows the same rule as that of \u05d4\u05d7\u05db\u05dd . The prophet traces back their words to an unvarnished expression of their true meaning, just as he does in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTgwXQ==\">Isaiah 28:15<\/a>. They forbid the prophets of Jehovah to prophesy, more especially <em> n e kho\u0304cho\u0304th <\/em> , straight or true things (things not agreeable to their own wishes), but would rather hear <em> c ha\u0306la\u0302qo\u0304th <\/em> , i.e., smooth, insinuating, and flattering things, and even <em> maha\u0306thallo\u0304th <\/em> (from <em> ha\u0302thal <\/em> , Talm. <em> tal <\/em> , <em> ludere <\/em> ), i.e., illusions or deceits. Their desire was to be entertained and lauded, not repelled and instructed. The prophets are to adopt another course ( \u05de\u05e0\u05bc\u05d9 only occurs here, and that twice, instead of the more usual \u05de\u05e0\u05bc\u05d9 = \u05de\u05df , after the form \u05d0\u05dc\u05d9 , \u05e2\u05dc\u05d9 ), and not trouble them any more with the Holy One of Israel, whom they (at least Isaiah, who is most fond of calling Jehovah by this name) have always in their mouths.<\/p>",
