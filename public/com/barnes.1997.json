    "html": "<p><em>Behold, it is written before me<\/em>&mdash;That is, the crimes of which they had been guilty, or the sentence which would be consequent thereon. The allusion is to the custom of having the decrees of kings recorded in a volume or on a table, and kept in their presence, so that they might be seen and not forgotten. An allusion to this custom of opening the books containing a record of this kind on trials, occurs in <a class=\"ref\">Daniel 7:10<\/a> , &lsquo;The judgment was set, and the books were opened.&rsquo; So also <a class=\"ref\">Revelation 20:12<\/a> , &lsquo;And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened; and another book was opened, which is the book of life, and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.&rsquo; So here. An impartial record had been made, and God would recompense them according to their deeds.<\/p><p><em>I will not keep silence<\/em>&mdash;Nothing shall compel me to desist from declaring a sentence which shall be just and right.<\/p><p><em>But will recompense, even recompense<\/em>&mdash;That is, I will certainly requite them. The word is repeated in accordance with the usual manner in Hebrew to denote emphasis.<\/p><p><em>Into their bosom<\/em>&mdash;(See <a class=\"ref\">Psalm 79:12; Jeremiah 32:18; Luke 6:38<\/a>). The word bosom, here refers to a custom among the Orientals of making the bosom or front of their garments large and loose, so that articles could be carried in them, answering the purpose of our pockets (compare <a class=\"ref\">Exodus 4:6-7; Proverbs 6:27<\/a>). The sense here is, that God would abundantly punish them for their sins.<\/p> ",
