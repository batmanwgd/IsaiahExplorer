The prophet paints the brutality with which prisoners were treated on a march in vivid colours. What would men say of their boasted policy of an Egypto-Cushite alliance when they saw that as its disastrous issue? It may be noted that Rabshakeh\u2019s scornful phrase, \u201cThis bruised reed,\u201d seems to imply that Assyria had ceased to fear the power of Egypt; and Nahum (<a class=\"ref\">Nahum 3:8<\/a>) speaks of No (i.e., No-Amun or Thebes) as having, when he wrote, been conquered, and his people carried into captivity.<\/p>",
