Nephi states that \"the kindreds of the earth cannot be blessed unless [God] shall make bare his arm.\" How will they be blessed? According to Nephi, \"The Lord God will proceed to make bare his arm in the eyes of all the nations, <i>in bringing about his covenants and his gospel unto those who are of the house of Israel.<\/i>\" He goes on to state that the people will be brought \"out of captivity\" as well as \"out of obscurity and out of darkness; and they shall know that the Lord is their Savior and their Redeemer, the Mighty One of Israel.\" (<a class=\"ref\">1 Nephi 22:10-11<\/a>; italics added.)<\/p>     <p>In His second recitation of this verse, the resurrected Savior substituted the word \"<i>Father<\/i>\" for \"Lord.\" He then emphasized that \"the Father and I are one.\" Whatever Jesus does, it is what the Father would do and has His full approval.<\/p>",
