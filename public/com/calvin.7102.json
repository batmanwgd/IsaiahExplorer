We have formerly explained the object of those lively descriptions, which is, to bring the events, as it were, before our eyes, and to lead us to entertain stronger hopes of those things which appear to go beyond all belief. By again naming<i>Kir-Hareseth<\/i> , the chief city, and thus taking a part for the whole, he describes the destruction of the whole country.<\/p> ",
