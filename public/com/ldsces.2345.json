    "html": "<p>The tried and precious cornerstone is Jesus Christ Himself. Elder Bruce R. McConkie wrote: &ldquo;One of Isaiah&rsquo;s great Messianic prophecies was that the promised Messiah would be &lsquo;for a stone of stumbling and for a<em>rock of offence<\/em> to both the houses of Israel, for a gin and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem. And many among them shall stumble, and fall, and be broken, and be snared, and be taken.&rsquo; ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzgyMiI6Mn0=\">Isa. 8:14&ndash;15<\/a>.) Both Paul ( <a class=\"ref\">Rom. 9:33<\/a>) and Peter ( <a class=\"ref\">1 Pet. 2:7&ndash;8<\/a>) record the fulfilment of this prophecy.&rdquo; (<em>Mormon Doctrine,<\/em> p. 657.)<\/p><p>Jacob referred to this figure when he said that &ldquo;by the stumbling of the Jews they will reject the stone upon which they might build and have safe foundation&rdquo; ( <a class=\"ref\">Jacob 4:15<\/a>).<\/p><p>Paul also used the same imagery when he said the foundation of the Church of Jesus Christ was Apostles and prophets, with Christ Himself being the chief cornerstone (see <a class=\"ref\">Ephesians 2:19&ndash;20<\/a>).<\/p><p class=\"cite\"> LDS Church Educational System Old Testament Student Manual, 1 Kings&ndash;Malachi, Religion 302, Chapter 15, Item 13<\/p> ",
