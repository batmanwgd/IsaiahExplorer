The Prophet Joseph Smith prefaced verses 5 and 6 with these words: \"In addition to all temporal blessings, there is no other way for the Saints to be saved in these last days, [than by the gathering] as the concurrent testimony of all the holy prophets clearly proves\" (TPJS, p. 183). President Joseph Fielding Smith referred to verses 5 through 7 as one of the predictions of the gathering of Israel (see DS, 3:254). Through Isaiah, the Lord here assures Israel that he will be with them as they are gathered. Elder Orson Pratt spoke of verses 6 and 7 and the time when all Christians would be gathered together out of the world: \"Will it leave a Christian behind? Not one. Go and search New York, Philadelphia, and all the eastern States, and the middle and southern States, and then all Europe, for a Christian after this prophecy is fulfilled, and you can't find one. Why? Because they are all gathered in one. How? By new revelation.\" (JD, 18:186.) Those who are \"called by his name\" are those who have taken the name of Christ upon them in the waters of baptism and know his voice, as defined in <a class=\"ref\">Mosiah 5:6-15<\/a>.<\/p>     ",
