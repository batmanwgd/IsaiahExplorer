The crack expands, weakening the wall until it suddenly crumbles. Similarly, Judah's inhabitants have been weakened through sin; their iniquity increases like the crack in the wall until the nation is destroyed because its enemies are able to enter through the breach. This excellent description illustrates the effect of sin on all of us. Even a little sin, not repented of, can be like a crack in a wall, which can grow larger and larger until it leads to our spiritual destruction.<\/p> ",
