The exclamatory substantive clause in the first half of the v. is explained by a declaratory verbal clause in the second. The <em> \u201crebellious\u201d<\/em> were those who had both inwardly and outwardly broken away from Jehovah; <em> \u201csinners,\u201d<\/em> those who were living in open sins; and <em> \u201cthose who forsake Jehovah,\u201d<\/em> such as had become estranged from God in either of these ways.<\/p>",
