    "html": "<p>Although Isaiah uses the imagery of an angry parental God, the truth is that Jehovah is a loving and long-suffering God toward his people ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODUxMF0seyIxODczMSI6NH0seyIxODg3NCI6M31d\">Isaiah 43:4; 54:7-10; 63:7-9<\/a>). But because he is also a just and a righteous God, he must enforce upon them the consequences of their actions. In this instance, the king of Assyria\/Babylon, who personifies Jehovah&rsquo;s<em>anger<\/em> , acts as his<em>hand<\/em> of punishment ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODU2XQ==\">Isaiah 10:5<\/a>). Aside from literal earthquakes, it is<em>he<\/em> who is stirred to anger, who causes the &ldquo;mountains&rdquo; (nations) to &ldquo;quake&rdquo; and who reduces the wicked to &ldquo;litter&rdquo; or chaos (cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxNzc3MF0seyIxNzk0NSI6Mn0seyIxODM3OSI6M31d\">v 30; Isaiah 14:16-17; 37:26-28<\/a>).<\/p> ",
