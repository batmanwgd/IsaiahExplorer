    "html": "<p>Although Isaiah uses the imagery of an angry parental God, the truth is that Jehovah is a loving and long-suffering God toward his people (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg1MTAiOjF9LHsiMTg3MzEiOjR9LHsiMTg4NzQiOjN9XQ==\">Isaiah 43:4; 54:7-10; 63:7-9<\/a>). But because he is also a just and a righteous God, he must enforce upon them the consequences of their actions. In this instance, the king of Assyria\/Babylon, who personifies Jehovah&rsquo;s <em>anger<\/em>, acts as his <em>hand<\/em> of punishment (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc4NTYiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 10:5<\/a>). Aside from literal earthquakes, it is <em>he<\/em> who is stirred to anger, who causes the &ldquo;mountains&rdquo; (nations) to &ldquo;quake&rdquo; and who reduces the wicked to &ldquo;litter&rdquo; or chaos (cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc4ODEiOjF9LHsiMTc5NDUiOjJ9LHsiMTgzNzkiOjN9XQ==\">v 30; Isaiah 14:16-17; 37:26-28<\/a>).<\/p>",
