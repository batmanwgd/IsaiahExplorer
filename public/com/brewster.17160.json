    "html": "<p><b>(<a class=\"ref\">2 Nephi 8:9<\/a>).<\/b>\"<i>Art thou not he that hath cut Rahab, and wounded the dragon?<\/i>\" In desperation, but almost rhetorically, Israel asks the Lord if He is not the same who previously defeated Rahab and the dragon. The psalmist also mentioned the utter defeat of Rahab. (<a class=\"ref\">Psalm 89:10<\/a>.) The \"dragon\" is easily identified as Satan. (<a class=\"ref\">Revelation 12:7-9; 20:2<\/a>.) The identity of \"Rahab\" is a little more difficult. Some scholars suggest Rahab represents Egypt while others say it is a sea monster representing Satan. Footnote reference \"<i>c<\/i>\" in the Book of Mormon text cites <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTUzXQ==\">Isaiah 27:1<\/a> as a cross-reference, which speaks of \"leviathan that crooked serpent.\" The footnote identifies \"leviathan\" as \"a legendary sea-monster representing the forces of chaos that opposed the Creator.\" (LDSKJ, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTUzXQ==\">Isaiah 27:1<\/a>, footnote <i>c.<\/i>)<\/p>",
