    "html": "  <p>  <b>2 Nephi 22:3. \"Wells of salvation\"<\/b> What better metaphor for the gospel could there be for a desert people than plentiful water? It gives life, it sustains, it saves. Jesus taught, \"Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again: But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life\" (John 4:13\u201314).  <\/p>  <blockquote>  <b>Fred H. Wight:<\/b>It was water from a Bethlehem well for which David in the wilderness longed. To appreciate his desire, one needs to know what thirst in the wilderness means, and also be acquainted with the cool water of Bethlehem wells and cisterns. . . . The men of Bethlehem boast of their cool water. One man was given a drink, but expressed a longing for water out of his father's vineyard, saying that it was so cold that he couldn't drink an entire glassful without taking it away from his lips at least three times.
