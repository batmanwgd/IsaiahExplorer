    "html": "<p><em>The rings<\/em>&mdash;Usually worn on the fingers.<\/p><p>And nose-jewels&mdash;The custom of wearing jewels in the &ldquo;nose&rdquo; has generally prevailed in savage tribes, and was common, and is still, in Eastern nations&mdash;among the Arabians, Persians, etc. Sir John Chardin says, &lsquo;It is the custom in almost all the East for the women to wear rings in their noses, in the left nostril, which is bored low down in the middle. These rings are of gold, and have commonly two pearls and one ruby between, placed in the ring. I never saw a girl or young woman in Arabia, or in all Persia, who did not wear a ring in this manner in her nostrils.&rsquo;&mdash;Harmer&rsquo;s &ldquo;Obs.,&rdquo; iv., p. 318. The picture in the book illustrates the usual form of this ornament in the East.<\/p>",
