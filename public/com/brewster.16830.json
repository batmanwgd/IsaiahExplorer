It was a sign of humiliation, particularly for Hebrew men. (See <a class=\"ref\">2 Samuel 10:4-5<\/a>.) It was also done to facilitate prisoner sanitation and to keep them separate from the rest of the population. (In their shaved condition they were easily identified, thus limiting escape possibilities.)<\/p>     <p>Monte Nyman suggests that \"the Lord's 'shaving with a razor that is hired' symbolizes the comfort of having someone else perform a tedious or unpleasant task, such as \u2026 the Lord's using the king of Assyria to do the unpleasant task of punishing the wickedness of Judah.\" (GAWI, 59.)<\/p>",
