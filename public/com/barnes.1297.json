    "html": "<p><em>For the Lord hath poured out upon you<\/em> &mdash;The word rendered &lsquo;hath poured out&rsquo; (\u05e0\u05e1\u05da na\u0302sak) is usually referred to the act of pouring out a libation, or drink-offering in worship<a class=\"ref\">Exodus 30:9; Hosea 9:4<\/a> ;<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MjE5XQ==\">Isaiah 30:1<\/a> . Here it means that Yahweh had, as it were, &ldquo;drenched them&rdquo; (Septuagint, &pi;&epsilon;&pi;&omicron;\u0301&tau;&iota;&kappa;&epsilon; pepotike) with a spirit of stupefaction. This is traced to God in accordance with the usual custom in the Bible, by which his providential agency is recognized in all events (see the notes at<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzc3OSI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 6:9-10<\/a>). Compare the notes at<a class=\"ref\">Romans 11:8<\/a>), where this passage is quoted from the Septuagint, and is applied to the Jews in the time of the apostle Paul.<\/p><p><em>The spirit of deep, sleep<\/em> &mdash;The word rendered &lsquo;deep sleep,&rsquo; is the same as is used in<a class=\"ref\">Genesis 2:21<\/a> , to denote the sleep that God brought on Adam; and in<a class=\"ref\">Genesis 15:12<\/a> , to denote the deep sleep that fell on Abraham, and when a horror of great darkness fell upon him; and in<a class=\"ref\">1 Samuel 26:12<\/a> , to denote the deep sleep that came upon Saul when David approached and took away the spear and the cruise of water from his bolster. Here it means spiritual sluggishness, inactivity, stupidity, that prevailed everywhere among the people in regard to the things of religion.<\/p><p><em>The seers<\/em> &mdash;Those that see visions, another name for the prophets (see the note at<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NjU2XQ==\">Isaiah 1:1<\/a>).<\/p><p><em>Hath he covered<\/em> &mdash;That is, he has covered their eyes; or they are all blind.<\/p> ",
