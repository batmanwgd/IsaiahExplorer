(Comp. <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 105:18<\/a>.) The point of the words lies in the fact that the doer of the great work is to be despised by the world\u2019s judgment or by his own people, by proud rulers (comp. <a class=\"ref\">1 Corinthians 1:27<\/a>); and yet he, and no other, will accomplish it.<\/p>",
