The whole passage is ironical, and full of keen sarcasm. At the approach of kings, the people tremble, and come forth to meet and receive them with pompous display. The Prophet makes a fictitious representation, that when this tyrant shall die and go down to<i> the grave, the dead<\/i> will go forth to meet and honor him, but with such honor as he deserves. As if he had said, \u201cNot only the living, but also<i> the dead<\/i> will rejoice at his death.<i> The dead<\/i> also will treat him respectfully according to his deserts.\u201d<\/p> ",
