    "html": " <p> <em>They shall be ashamed \"They are ashamed\"\u2014<\/em>, The reader cannot but observe the sudden transition from the solemn adoration of the secret and mysterious nature of God's counsels in regard to his people, to the spirited denunciation of the confusion of idolaters, and the final destruction of idolatry; contrasted with the salvation of Israel, not from temporal captivity, but the eternal salvation by the Messiah, strongly marked by the repetition and augmentation of the phrase, to the ages of eternity. But there is not only a sudden change in the sentiment, the change is equally observable in the construction of the sentences; which from the usual short measure, runs out at once into two distichs of the longer sort of verse. See Prelim. Dissert. p. 66, etc. There is another instance of the same kind and very like to this, of a sudden transition in regard both to the sentiment and construction in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDk4XQ==\">Isaiah 42:17<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n <p> <em>\"His adversaries\"\u2014<\/em>, This line, to the great diminution of the beauty of the distich, is imperfect in the present text: the subject of the proposition is not particularly expressed, as it is in the line following. The version of the Septuagint happily supplies the word that is lost: <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u03bf\u03b9\u0314 \u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03b5\u03b9\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9 \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03c9\u0345<\/span>, \"his adversaries,\" the original word was <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05e6\u05e8\u05d9\u05d5 <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, tsaraiv<\/span>,.\u2014L. <\/p>",
