So all the versions. But it seems from the seventh verse, and from the thing itself, that we should read <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d1\u05e9\u05de\u05d9 \u05e7\u05e8\u05d0\u05ea\u05d9\u05da <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">karathicha bishmi<\/span>, 'I have called thee by my name;' for this form of speech often occurs - the other never. For  <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NTg2XQ==\">Isaiah 45:24<\/a>, concerning Cyrus, is another matter; but when God calls Jacob Israel, he calls him by the name of God. See  <a class=\"ref\">Exodus 31:2<\/a>.\" - Secker.<\/p>",
