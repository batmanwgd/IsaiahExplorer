    "html": "<p> It is in accordance with this holy loving will that the cry is published in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NTg0XQ==\">Isaiah 45:22<\/a> : <em> \u201cTurn unto me, and be ye saved, all ye ends of the earth; for I am God, and none else.\u201d<\/em> The first imperative is hortatory, the second promising (cf., <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MzQ3XQ==\">Isaiah 36:16<\/a> and <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODE3XQ==\">Isaiah 8:9<\/a>): Jehovah desires both, viz., the conversion of all men to Himself; and through this their salvation, ad this His gracious will, which extends to all mankind, will not rest till its object has been fully accomplished. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NTg1XQ==\">Isaiah 45:23<\/a> <em> \u201cBy myself have I sworn, a word has gone out of a mouth of righteousness, and will not return, That to me every knee shall bend, every tongue swear.\u201d<\/em> Swearing by Himself (see <a class=\"ref\">Genesis 22:16<\/a>), God pledges what He swears with His own life (compare <a class=\"ref\">Romans 14:11<\/a>, \u201cas I live\u201d). Parallel to \u05e0\u05e9\u05c1\u05d1\u05bc\u05e2\u05ea\u05bc\u05d9 \u05d1\u05bc\u05d9 is the clause \u05d9\u05e9\u05c1\u05d5\u05bc\u05d1 \u05d5\u05dc\u05d0 \u05d3\u05bc\u05d1\u05e8 \u05e6\u05d3\u05e7 \u05de\u05e4\u05bc\u05d9 \u05d9\u05e6\u05d0 . Here Rosenm\u00fcller connects \u05d3\u05d1\u05e8 \u05e6\u05d3\u05e7\u05d4 together as if with a hyphen, in the sense of a truth-word (Jerome, <em> justitiae verbum <\/em> ). But this is grammatically impossible, since it would require \u05e6\u05d3\u05e7\u05d4 \u05d3\u05bc\u05d1\u05e8 ; moreover, it is opposed both to the accents, and to the <em> dagesh<\/em> in the <em> Daleth <\/em> . Hitzig's rendering is a better one: \u201cTruth (lxx \u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c3\u03c5\u0301\u03bd\u03b7 ), a word that does not return,\u201d - the latter being taken as an explanatory permutative; but in that case we should require \u05dc\u05d0 for \u05d5\u05dc\u05d0 , and <em> ts e da\u0302qa\u0302h <\/em> is not used in the sense of truth anywhere else (compare <em> tsadd\u0131\u0304q <\/em> , however, in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDc4XQ==\">Isaiah 41:26<\/a>). On the other hand, \u05e6\u05d3\u05e7\u05d4 might be equivalent to \u05d1\u05e6\u05d3\u05e7\u05d4 \u201cin righteousness;\u201d cf., <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NTA2XQ==\">Isaiah 42:25<\/a>, \u05d7\u05de\u05d4 = \u05d1\u05bc\u05d4\u05de\u05d4 ), if it were not incomparably more natural to connect together \u05e6\u05d3\u05e7\u05d4 \u05de\u05e4\u05d9 as a genitive construction; though not in the sense in which \u05d4\u05d2\u05d1\u05d5\u05e8\u05d4 \u05de\u05e4\u05d9 is used in post-biblical writings - namely, as equivalent to \u201cout of the mouth of God\u201d (see Buxtorf, <em> Lex. Chald.<\/em> Col. 385) - but rather in this way, that the mouth of God is described attributively as regulated in its words by His holy will (as \u201cspeaking righteousness,  ). A word has gone forth from this mouth of righteousness; and after it has once gone forth, it does not return without accomplishing its object (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzUyXQ==\">Isaiah 55:11<\/a>). What follows is not so much a promising prediction (that every knee will bend to me), as a definitive declaration of will (that it shall or must bend to me). According to <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MDIzLDE4NTM5XQ==\">Isaiah 19:18; Isaiah 44:5<\/a>, \u201cto me\u201d is to be regarded as carried forward, and so to be supplied after \u201cshall swear\u201d (the Septuagint rendering, \u03bf\u0313\u03bc\u03b5\u03b9\u0342\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u2026 \u03c4\u03bf\u0300\u03bd \u0398\u03b5\u03bf\u0301\u03bd , is false; that of Paul in <a class=\"ref\">Romans 14:11<\/a>, \u03b5\u0313\u03be\u03bf\u03bc\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03b7\u0301\u03c3\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03c9\u0342\u0345 \u0398\u03b5\u03c9\u0342\u0345 , is correct; and in this case, as in others also, the <em> Cod. Al.<\/em> of the Sept. has been corrected from the New Testament quotations).<\/p>",
