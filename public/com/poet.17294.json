    "html": "<p>Isaiah now speaks to both groups and perhaps even the world at large as he prophesies concerning a time (\"in that day\" meaning, most likely, the last days) when all people will turn to the Lord:<\/p> <blockquote><p><sup>7<\/sup> In that day men will look to their Maker<\/p> <p>and turn their eyes to the Holy One of Israel.<\/p> <p><sup>8<\/sup> They will not look to the altars,<\/p> <p>the work of their hands,<\/p> <p>and they will have no regard for the Asherah poles<\/p> <p>and the incense altars their fingers have made. (NIV)<\/p> <p>G. The people look to God.<\/p> <p>G'. They look away from idols.<\/p> <\/blockquote><p>The Asherah poles of verse 8 are the idols, images, or symbols of the pagan fertility goddess, Asherah. The female counterpart to Baal, she was notorious for the prostitution cults associated with her temples. It is also possible that the \"poles\" mentioned above were phallic symbols with her figure carved upon them. Despite the widespread influence of idolatry in Isaiah's day and the great work (\"the work of their hands\") in constructing the objects for pagan worship and fertility rituals, Isaiah foresees a time when mankind will eventually be spiritually mature enough to turn away from pagan polytheism and embrace the one Lord of the earth. This trend has been the case historically as monotheistic religions have gradually won out over paganism.<\/p>",
