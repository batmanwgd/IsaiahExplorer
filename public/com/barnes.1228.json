    "html": "<p><em>Trust ye in the Lord for ever<\/em> &mdash;The sense is, &lsquo;Let your confidence in God on no occasion fail. Let no calamity, no adversity, no persecution, no poverty, no trial of any kind, prevent your reposing entire confidence in him.&rsquo; This is spoken evidently in view of the fact stated in the previous verse, that the mind that is stayed on him shall have perfect peace.<\/p><p><em>For in the Lord Jehovah<\/em> &mdash;&lsquo;This is one of the four places where our translators have retained the original word Yahweh (compare<a class=\"ref\">Exodus 6:3; Psalm 133:1-3<\/a> :18; the notes at<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3OTAzXQ==\">Isaiah 12:2<\/a>). The original is \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d4 \u05d1\u05d9\u05d4 beya\u0302hh yehova\u0302h; the first word, \u05d9\u05d4 ya\u0302hh, (compare<a class=\"ref\">Psalm 68:4<\/a>), being merely an abridged form of Yahweh. The same form occurs in<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3OTAzXQ==\">Isaiah 12:2<\/a> . The union of these two forms seems designed to express, in the highest sense possible, the majesty, glory, and holiness of God; to excite the highest possible reverence where language fails of completely conveying the idea.<\/p><p><em>Is everlasting strength<\/em> &mdash;Hebrew as in the Margin, &lsquo;The rock of ages;&rsquo; a more poetic and beautiful expression than in our translation. The idea is, that God is firm and unchangeable like an eternal rock; and that in him we may find protection and defense for everlasting ages (see<a class=\"ref\">Deuteronomy 32:4<\/a> , et al.;<a class=\"ref\">1 Samuel 2:2; 2 Samuel 22:32, 2 Samuel 22:47; 2 Samuel 23:3; Psalm 18:31; Psalm 19:14; Psalm 28:1; Psalm 42:9; Psalm 62:2, Psalm 62:6-7<\/a> ,..., where God is called &lsquo;a rock&rsquo;).<\/p> ",
