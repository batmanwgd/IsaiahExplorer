What more proof do his people want of Jehovah&rsquo;s desire to deliver them from destruction in his Day of Judgment? Or what additional evidence do they need that their idolatry brings covenant curses? Parallel verses show that his people&rsquo;s giving up the things they covet that money can buy defines repentance itself. Repenting of worshiping idols, in other words, constitutes an integral part of returning to God (cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg0OTgiOjd9LFsxODc0MywxODc0OF1d\">Isaiah 42:17-23; 55:2, 7 <\/a>). <\/p> ",
