But in the context provided by the surrounding verses, it <i>becomes<\/i> clear that the Lord is teaching that revelation is understood only by those who are willing and prepared to listen. Paul, in writing to the Corinthians about speaking in tongues, quotes this verse to show that we must be prepared to understand prophecy, and we prepare by believing (see <a class=\"ref\">1 Cor. 14:20-22<\/a>; note that Paul attributed the verse to Moses, not Isaiah-perhaps it was written by both).<\/p>     ",
