    "html": "<p>Structurally, the last section of chapter 1 can stand alone as an independent pronouncement. The Lord first addresses a very wicked Jerusalem, threatening vengeance upon those who become his enemies. He then foretells a purging and a restoration of Zion, and concludes by prophesying the destruction of the wicked. This pronouncement is divided into three segments in the King James Version (note the markings) which follow a chiastic pattern of negative-positive-negative, that is: warning first of wickedness and vengeance (vs. 21-24), then promising cleansing and redemption (vs. 25-27), and finally burning the wicked and the worldly (vs. 28-31). The primary themes of these three segments also follow the common and easily remembered pattern of apostasy-restoration-judgment. These three segments of the pronouncement will be discussed in turn.<\/p>",
