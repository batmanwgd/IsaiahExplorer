    "html": "<p>The core passage of chs. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODkyNCI6MjR9\">56&ndash;66<\/a> continues with a declaration or self-predication of YHVH (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODg1Ml0seyIxNzgzMSI6MjF9XQ==\">61:8&ndash;9<\/a>) followed by a hymn that, although based on the thanksgiving psalms, was created ad hoc for this situation (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODg1NF0seyIxNzg4NiI6MTZ9XQ==\">10&ndash;11<\/a>). One result of the prophetic conviction of speaking in the Name of God is that it is not always possible to distinguish the prophetic from the divine first person. This going back and forth between third and first person with reference to YHVH is attested throughout chs. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODg1NiI6MTJ9\">60&ndash;62<\/a> and is not always indicative of a division in the text. The only exceptions are <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODQ1XQ==\">61:1&ndash;3b<\/a>, where the prophet speaks in his own name; <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODYzXQ==\">62:8<\/a>, which is a direct citation; and <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODg1Ml0seyIxNzgzMSI6MjF9XQ==\">61:8&ndash;9<\/a>, where YHVH is also explicitly identified as speaker.<\/p><p>This first passage (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODg1Ml0seyIxNzgzMSI6MjF9XQ==\">61:8&ndash;9<\/a>) should be read as affirming the truth and authority of the prophetic prediction in vv <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODQ1XQ==\">1&ndash;3b<\/a> rather than confirming the prophet&rsquo;s credentials. Read in context, it would be a declaration in favor of those who mourn over Zion (vv <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODg0Nl0seyIxNzcwOSI6MjZ9XQ==\">2&ndash;3<\/a>), but as a distinct statement it is a declaration in favor of Israel <em>tout court<\/em> vis-&agrave;-vis foreign nations. Hence the need to reject the alternative reading of the second half of v <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODUyXQ==\">8a<\/a> (&ldquo;I hate rapine together with a burnt offering&rdquo;; see Notes). The idea is that, since YHVH is a God of justice (cf. <a class=\"ref\">Ps 37:28<\/a>), he opposes the rapine and wrongdoing from which Israel has suffered for so long. The twin concepts of reward (<em>p\u0115\u02bfull&acirc;<\/em>) and retribution (<em>g\u0115m&ucirc;l<\/em>) play an important role in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODkyNCI6MjR9\">Isa 40&ndash;66<\/a>. The positive term (<em>p\u0115\u02bfull&acirc;<\/em>) connotes giving people what is their due, and it is therefore found parallel with &ldquo;justice&rdquo; (<em>mi&scaron;p\u0101\u1e6d<\/em>, 49:4) and &ldquo;wages&rdquo; (<em>\u015b\u0101k\u0101r<\/em>, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDMxLDE4ODY1XQ==\">40:10; 62:10<\/a>; cf. <a class=\"ref\">Lev 19:13<\/a>). The idea is introduced at the very beginning of <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODkyNCI6MjR9\">40&ndash;66<\/a> (Israel&rsquo;s servitude is over, her debt has been paid, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDIzXQ==\">40:2<\/a>) and serves to make connection with the &ldquo;double portion&rdquo; in the passage immediately preceding (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODUxXQ==\">61:7<\/a>). In one instance only (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4OTA1XQ==\">65:7<\/a>), <em>p\u0115\u02bfull&acirc;<\/em> has the same negative force as <em>g\u0115m&ucirc;l<\/em> (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MzI1LDE4ODE5LDE4OTI5XQ==\">35:4; 59:18; 66:6<\/a>), with the sense of paying someone back for wrongs committed.<\/p><p>The perpetual covenant (<em>b\u0115r&icirc;t \u02bf&ocirc;l\u0101m<\/em>) is more a declaration of intent than a bilateral agreement, and in this sense it appears in the Priestly history in the Pentateuch in connection with the postdiluvian dispensation (<a class=\"ref\">Gen 9:16<\/a>) and the institution of circumcision (<a class=\"ref\">Gen 17:7, 13, 19<\/a>). A perpetual covenant is one that, unlike other covenants and treaties between parties equal or unequal, does not require reconfirmation or reratification at intervals&mdash;or example at the death of a ruler. Use of the expression at this point may have been prompted by the perpetual Davidic covenant mentioned at <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODc0NF0seyIxNzc0MSI6MzB9XQ==\">55:3&ndash;5<\/a>, which gave him preeminence among the nations. This is precisely what is promised for Israel as a whole in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODg1Ml0seyIxNzgzMSI6MjF9XQ==\">61:8&ndash;9<\/a>.<\/p><p>Since no one at the time of writing was concerned with identifying distinct sources in the Pentateuch, there would have been no problem in applying the Priestly concept of a <em>b\u0115r&icirc;t \u02bf&ocirc;l\u0101m<\/em> to the Abrahamic promises. Without subscribing to Torrey&rsquo;s identification of the Servant figure with Abraham (Torrey 1928, 310&ndash;13 and passim), we can say that the Abrahamic traditions, in whatever form they existed at that time, constitute an important subplot throughout chs. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODkyNCI6MjR9\">40&ndash;66<\/a>. Anxiety about demographic survival and land tenure, for understandable reasons acute in the early Persian period, are reflected in the Abraham narrative cycle.<\/p><p>In <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODkyNCI6MjR9\">Isa 40&ndash;66<\/a>, wherever the great nation theme (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODUzNV0seyIxNzc0MSI6MzB9LFsxODYzNCwxODY3NiwxODcyNSwxODg0M10seyIxODA1NCI6MjV9XQ==\">44:1&ndash;5; 48:19; 51:2; 54:1; 60:21&ndash;22<\/a>) or secure tenure of land (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODY1Nl0seyIxODAzNyI6MTd9LFsxODg0M11d\">49:19&ndash;21; 60:21<\/a>) in an issue, the figure of Abraham will be somewhere in the background. Likewise, the shadowy figure of the initially infertile Sarah, who is mentioned once (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4Njc2XQ==\">51:2<\/a>), can be discerned behind that of the woman Zion (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODcyNV0seyIxNzgwOSI6MjJ9XQ==\">54:1&ndash;8<\/a>). The clearest statement is <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODg0M10seyIxODA1NCI6MjV9XQ==\">60:21&ndash;22<\/a>:<\/p><p>Your people, righteous one and all,<\/p><p>will possess the land forever,<\/p><p>the shoot that I myself planted,<\/p><p>the work of my hands that I might be glorified.<\/p><p>The least will become a thousand,<\/p><p>the youngest a numerous nation.<\/p><p>I am YHVH!<\/p><p>At its appointed time,<\/p><p>swiftly will I bring it about.<\/p><p>The people will be righteous like Abraham (<a class=\"ref\">Gen 15:6<\/a>), they will inherit land (<a class=\"ref\">Gen 15:7<\/a>), they will become a great nation (<em>g&ocirc;y g\u0101d&ocirc;l<\/em>, <a class=\"ref\">Gen 12:2<\/a>), and all of this is confirmed by a strong asseveration comparable to an oath (<a class=\"ref\">Gen 15:18&ndash;21<\/a>).<\/p><p>The linked promises of land and nationhood are encapsulated in the blessing on Abraham and his descendants with which vv <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODg1Ml0seyIxNzgzMSI6MjF9XQ==\">8&ndash;9<\/a> conclude. Invocation of the blessing on Abraham is repeated practically verbatim in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4OTIxXQ==\">65:23b<\/a>: &ldquo;they will be a race blessed by YHVH, \/ they and their offspring with them,&rdquo; using the same paired terms, <em>zera\u02bf<\/em>, &ldquo;race,&rdquo; literally &ldquo;seed&rdquo;; and <em>\u1e63e\u02be\u0115\u1e63\u0101\u02be&icirc;m<\/em>, &ldquo;offspring&rdquo; (see also <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NTM3LDE4NjM0XQ==\">44:3 and 48:19<\/a>see also ).<\/p><p>There is a rather abrupt passage from vv <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODg1Ml0seyIxNzgzMSI6MjF9XQ==\">8&ndash;9<\/a>, spoken by YHVH, to v <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODU0XQ==\">10<\/a>, which is a thanksgiving hymn addressed to YHVH, though similar eschatological psalms of praise are present throughout the second major segment of the book (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODQ5MV0seyIxNzkwOCI6MjJ9LFsxODU1NywxODU3MCwxODY1MF1d\">42:10&ndash;13; 44:23; 45:8; 49:13<\/a> cf. also <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxNzkwMl0seyIxNzc3MSI6MTN9XQ==\">12:1&ndash;6<\/a>). Many commentators restrict the hymn to v <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODU0XQ==\">10<\/a> on the grounds that it interrupts the continuity between v <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODUzXQ==\">9<\/a> and v <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODU1XQ==\">11<\/a> and has therefore been inserted at this point (Marti 1900, 387&ndash;88; Duhm 1922, 458; Fohrer 1964, 254; Pauritsch 1971, 106; Westermann 1969, 370&ndash;71; Vermeylen 1978, 482&ndash;83).<\/p><p>There is reason to believe that v <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODU1XQ==\">11<\/a> has been appended to v <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODU0XQ==\">10<\/a> since the transition from investitute and bridal attire in v <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODU0XQ==\">10<\/a> to the organic metaphor in v <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODU1XQ==\">11<\/a> is somewhat jarring. But the similarity between <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODUzLDE4ODU1XQ==\">9 and 11<\/a> is not striking, and v<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODU1XQ==\"> 11<\/a> reads more like a concluding reflection on the ineluctability of the divine plan, comparable to <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODc1MV0seyIxNzg4NiI6MTZ9XQ==\">55:10&ndash;11<\/a>. Both passages use similar metaphors, organic growth and rainfall, and deploy them in the same manner (<em>ka\u02be\u0103&scaron;er &hellip; k\u0113n<\/em>, &ldquo;Just as X &hellip; so Y&rdquo;). Above all, the two passages are similar in function, in providing a final assurance that what God promises through the words of his prophet will come about as surely as the processes of growth and regeneration in nature will continue to take place.<\/p><p>For the same reason, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODg1NV0seyIxNzg4NiI6MTZ9XQ==\">61:11 or 61:10&ndash;11<\/a> should not be attached to the following chapter. Kissane (1960, 281), for example, read <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODg1NF0seyIxNzg4NiI6MTZ9XQ==\">61:10&ndash;11<\/a> as the first stanza in a poem (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODU0LDE4ODY0XQ==\">61:10&ndash;62:9<\/a>), and de Moor reached the same conclusion on purely stichometric grounds, dividing this extended composition into twelve strophes and six canticles (1997, 325&ndash;46). However, the language of this brief psalm and the concluding verse have closer links with <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODg0NV0seyIxNzcwOSI6MjZ9XQ==\">61:1&ndash;3<\/a> than with ch. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">62<\/a>. The following similarities may be noted:<\/p><p><em>&scaron;&ocirc;\u015b \u02be\u0101\u015b&icirc;\u015b<\/em> (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODU0XQ==\">10a<\/a>)&mdash;<em>&scaron;emen \u015b\u0101\u015b&ocirc;n<\/em> (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODQ3XQ==\">3b<\/a>)<\/p><p><em>ya\u02bf\u0103\u1e6d\u0113n&icirc;<\/em> (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODU0XQ==\">10b<\/a>)&mdash;<em>ma\u02bfa\u1e6deh<\/em> (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODQ3XQ==\">3b<\/a>)<\/p><p><em>p\u0115\u02be\u0113r<\/em> (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODU0XQ==\">10c<\/a>)&mdash;<em>p\u0115\u02be\u0113r<\/em> (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODQ3XQ==\">3a<\/a>), <em>l\u0115hitp\u0101\u02be\u0113r<\/em> (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODQ3XQ==\">3c<\/a>)<\/p><p><em>t\u0115hill&acirc;<\/em> (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODU1XQ==\">11b<\/a>)&mdash;<em>t\u0115hill&acirc;<\/em> (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODQ3XQ==\">3b<\/a>)<\/p><p>In addition, the title <em>\u02be\u0103donay YHVH<\/em> (&ldquo;the Sovereign Lord YHVH&rdquo;) is used in both and is absent from ch. 62.<\/p><p>Who is the speaker who rejoices in v <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODU0XQ==\">10<\/a>? Since this brief hymn is modeled on the liturgical thanksgiving psalms (e.g.,<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxNzgzMl0seyIxNzc0MSI6MzB9LFsxODIyMCwxODMzMF0seyIxNzg1MiI6MzR9XQ==\"> 9:2&ndash;5; 30:2; 35:9&ndash;10<\/a>), the simple answer is this: regardless of who composed the psalm in question, the words are put into the mouth of the anonymous worshiper who has received benefits from YHVH. But, since the psalm was created expressly for this situation, the beneficiaries must be the mourners over Zion (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODg0Nl0seyIxNzcwOSI6MjZ9XQ==\">61:2&ndash;3<\/a>), who constitute the holy remnant and who are referred to elsewhere as the Servants of YHVH. Though the language is unspecific in regard to gender, the Targum was not wrong in identifying the speaker explicitly as Jerusalem, since in chs. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODkyNCI6MjR9\">56&ndash;66<\/a> Jerusalem represents the community of the last age, now present proleptically in the community of the faithful. Writers who hold that the speaker is the prophet (e.g., Volz 1932, 260; Sekine 1989, 87; Lau 1994, 86&ndash;87) may be correct in terms of authorship. However, the language of this brief psalm is eminently appropriate for Jerusalem as the central symbolic entity in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODkyNCI6MjR9\">56&ndash;66<\/a>, but not for a prophet.<\/p><p>Our best clue to decoding the symbolism of investiture is found in the following chapter, which combines the images of royalty (the royal crown and diadem) and the bridal couple and focuses them on Zion\/Jerusalem (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODg1OF0seyIxNzc0MSI6MzB9XQ==\">62:3&ndash;5<\/a>). The age-old rite of the investiture of a monarch gives visual expression to the supreme status of the office. The garments are the garments of triumph and the robe of victory. This ancient royal rite also influenced the investiture of the priest in Israel (<a class=\"ref\">Exod 28:1&ndash;43; 39:1&ndash;31<\/a>) and is reflected in the <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isa 61<\/a> psalm, which alludes to the robe (<em>m\u0115\u02bf&icirc;l<\/em>) and the turban (<em>p\u0115\u02be\u0113r<\/em>), which were also part of the sacerdotal wardrobe (<a class=\"ref\">Exod 39:28; Ezek 44:18; 1 Chr 15:27<\/a>). The priestly allusion is the reason for the anomalous use of the verb <em>khn<\/em> (Piel, normally &ldquo;to function as a priest&rdquo;), which should not be emended (see Note h).<\/p><p>In the concluding verse rounding off the hymn, the verb <em>\u1e63m\u1e25<\/em> (Hiphil, &ldquo;blossom,&rdquo; &ldquo;spring up&rdquo;) is used twice, together with the corresponding substantive <em>\u1e63ema\u1e25<\/em> (&ldquo;growth,&rdquo; &ldquo;shoot&rdquo;). This raises an interesting issue, because <em>\u1e63ema\u1e25<\/em> seems to have become a code name for the Davidic dynast in the post-destruction period. <a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 23:5 and 33:15<\/a> anticipate the coming of a righteous or legitimate ruler (<em>\u1e63ema\u1e25 \u1e63add&icirc;q<\/em>), and other texts speak symbolically of the raising up of the horn of David (<a class=\"ref\">Ezek 29:21; Ps 132:17<\/a>) or the fallen booth of David (<a class=\"ref\">Amos 9:11<\/a>), clearly referring to the restoration of the national dynasty. During the great crisis at the beginning of the reign of Darius I (521&ndash;520), prophetic groups in Judah and possibly in the diaspora were supporting the restoration of the Judean royal house in the person of Zerubbabel, grandson of Jehoiachin, second-last king of Judah. As ruler designate, he is referred to as &ldquo;my servant <em>\u1e63ema\u1e25<\/em>&rdquo; (<a class=\"ref\">Zech 3:8; 6:12<\/a>), and it is predicted that he will &ldquo;spring up in his place&rdquo; (<em>mitta\u1e25t&acirc;v yi\u1e63ma\u1e25<\/em>, <a class=\"ref\">Zech 6:12<\/a>). For these groups, the triumph of Israel would come about under the leadership of a restored dynasty.<\/p><p>By the time <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODg1NF0seyIxNzg4NiI6MTZ9XQ==\">Isa 61:10&ndash;11<\/a> came to be written, Zerubbabel had long disappeared from the scene. There were probably still those who cherished the dynastic hope, but for the Isaianic Servant and his disciples the future lay with a purified Israel as the instrument of God&rsquo;s own unmediated work within human affairs. We see that the organic metaphor of a plant or shoot rising from the ground is still in use but has been reapplied to new events and situations (<em>\u1e25\u0103d\u0101&scaron;&ocirc;t<\/em>, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDkwLDE4NTI1XQ==\">Isa 42:9; 43:19<\/a>) and to the nucleus of a new people envisaged in this prophetic tradition (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NTM4LDE3NzM2XQ==\">Isa 44:4; 4:2<\/a>).<\/p><p>Blenkinsopp, J.
