It is the standard the Lord has raised for His people and one to which the gentiles of the nations of the earth should seek. (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 45:9<\/a>; DCE, 157.) Elder Marion G. Romney declared: \"This Church is the standard which Isaiah said the Lord would set up for the people in the latter days. \u2026 This Church is the ensign on the mountain spoken of by the Old Testament prophets.\" (CR, April 1961, p. 119.)<\/p>     <p>There is another possibility to consider regarding the identity of this standard or ensign. Speaking particularly of the Book of Mormon, the Lord said to Nephi, \"My words shall hiss forth unto the ends of the earth, for a standard unto my people, which are of the house of Israel.\" (<a class=\"ref\">2 Nephi 29:2<\/a>.) The Prophet Joseph identified the Book of Mormon as \"the keystone of our religion,\" making it inseparable with the truthfulness of the Church. Thus, whether we speak of the Church or the Book of Mormon, both are standards or ensigns to the nations of the earth.
