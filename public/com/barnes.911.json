It refers to the designs which they would form to destroy the Jewish state. <\/p> <p> <em>Speak the word <\/em>&mdash;That is, give the command&mdash;to overturn the nation of the Jews. <\/p> <p> <em>It shall not stand <\/em>&mdash;It shall not be accomplished. <\/p> <p> <em>For God is with us <\/em>&mdash;Hebrew &lsquo;For Immanuel.&rsquo; It indicates the confidence of the prophet in view of the promise and the pledge. His reliance was there. Though the enemies were strong and mighty; though the confederacy was formidable; yet his simple reliance was in the name Immanuel! In this he had confidence, in spite of all the violent efforts and designs of the foes of Judah; see <a class=\"ref\">Numbers 14:9<\/a>: <\/p> <p>Only, rebel not ye against the Lord: <\/p> <p>Neither fear ye the people of the land; <\/p> <p>For they are bread for us; <\/p> <p>Their defense is departed from them, <\/p> <p>And Jehovah is with us, <\/p> <p>Fear thom not. <\/p> <p>See also <a class=\"ref\">Psalm 46:6-7<\/a>: <\/p> <p>The heathen raged, <\/p> <p>The kingdoms were moved. <\/p> <p>He uttered his voice, the earth dissolved. <\/p> <p>Jehovah of hosts is with us; <\/p> <p>The God of Jacob is our refuge. <\/p> ",
