The Vulg., however, gives \u201ccrowned.\u201d<\/p>\n <p>Whose merchants are princes.\u2014It is a fact worth noting in the history of language that the word for \u201cmerchants\u201d here, and in <a class=\"ref\">Hosea 12:7; Proverbs 31:24<\/a>, is the same as that for Canaanite. The traffickers of the earth were pre-eminently of that race.<\/p>",
