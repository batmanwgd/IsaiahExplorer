    "html": "<p>The destruction of Babylon is denounced by a beautiful selection of circumstances, in which her prosperous is contrasted with her adverse condition. She is represented as a tender and delicate female reduced to the work and abject condition of a slave, and bereaved of every consolation,<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODYwMSI6NH0=\">Isaiah 47:1-4<\/a> . And that on account of her cruelty, particularly to God's people, her pride, voluptuousness, sorceries, and incantations,<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODYwNSI6N30=\">Isaiah 47:5-11<\/a> . The folly of these last practices elegantly exposed by the prophet,<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODYxMiI6NH0=\">Isaiah 47:12-15<\/a> . It is worthy of observation that almost all the imagery of this chapter is applied in the book of the Revelation, (in nearly the same words), to the antitype of the illustrious capital of the Chaldean empire, viz., Babylon the Great.<\/p> ",
