    "html": " <p> <em>That confirmeth the word of his servant <\/em>&mdash;Probably the word &rsquo;servant&rsquo; here is to be taken in a collective sense, as referring to the prophets in general who had foretold the return of the Jews to their own land, and the rebuilding of Jerusalem. Or it may be, that the prophet refers more particularly to himself as having made a full prediction of this event. The parallel expression, &lsquo;his messengers,&rsquo; however, is in the plural number, and thus it is rendered probable that the word here refers to the prophets collectively. The idea is, that it was a characteristic of God to establish the words of his servants the prophets, and that their predictions in regard to the return from the captivity in a special manner would be fulfilled. <\/p> <p> <em>The counsel of his messengers <\/em>&mdash;The prophets whom he had sent to announce future events, and to give counsel and consolation to the nation. <\/p> <p> <em>That saith to Jerusalem <\/em>&mdash;Jerusalem is here supposed to be lying in ruins, and the people to be in captivity in Babylon. In this situation, God is represented as addressing desolate Jerusalem, and saying, that it should be again inhabited, and that the cities of Judah should be rebuilt. <\/p> <p> <em>The decayed places <\/em>&mdash;Margin, &lsquo;Wastes.&rsquo; No land, probably, was ever more completely desolated than the land of Judea when its inhabitants were carried to Babylon. <\/p> ",
