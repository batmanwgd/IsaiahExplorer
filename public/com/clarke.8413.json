Vine-twigs are particularly mentioned as used for fuel in dressing their food, by D'Arvieux; La Roque, Palestine, p. 198. Ezekiel says, in his parable of the vine, used figuratively for the people of God, as the vineyard is here: \"Shall wood be taken thereof to do any work? or will men take a pin of it to hang any vessel thereon? Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel; \" <a class=\"ref\">Ezekiel 15:3, Ezekiel 15:4 <\/a>. \"If a man abide not in one, \"saith our Lord, \"he is cast forth as a branch of the vine and is withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned;\" <a class=\"ref\">John 15:6 <\/a>. They employed women and children to gather these things, and they laid them up in store for use. The dressing and pruning their vines afforded a good supply of the last sort of fuel; but the prophet says that the vines themselves of the beloved vineyard shall be blasted, withered, and broken, and the women shall come and gather them up, and carry away the whole of them to make their fires for domestic uses.
