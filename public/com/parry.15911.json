    "html": " <p>When Jesus taught in the synagogue in Nazareth, he quoted all of 61:1 and the first line of 61:2, indicating that he was the fulfillment of this prophecy (<a class=\"ref\">Luke 4:16-<\/a> 21). The remainder of 61:2 is millennial and does not apply to Christ's first coming.<\/p> <p> <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODg0NSI6M30=\">Isa. 61:1-3<\/a> provides a powerful, compact description of the Savior's mission, both during his mortal ministry and as long as the earth shall last: Isaiah prophesies that Jesus will have the Spirit of God; he will be anointed by God; he will preach good tidings; he will be sent to bless the brokenhearted, the captives, and those who mourn (61:1-2).<\/p> <p>Those in Zion will receive special blessings from the Messiah: a crown of beauty will replace the ashes of mourning, gladness will replace sorrow, praise and rejoicing will replace depression. As Christ is the tree of life, so will his children be trees of righteousness, given life by the Lord, to his glory and to theirs (<a class=\"ref\">Alma 13:23<\/a>). <\/p> <blockquote> The <i>Spirit<\/i> of the <u>Lord God<\/u> is upon me;     <br>because the <u>Lord<\/u> hath <i>anointed<\/i> me     <br><i>to<\/i> <i>preach good tidings<\/i> unto the <u>meek<\/u>;     <br>he hath sent me <i>to<\/i> <i>bind up<\/i> the <u>brokenhearted<\/u>,     <br><i>to<\/i> <i>proclaim liberty<\/i> to the <u>captives<\/u>,     <br>and <i>the opening<\/i> of the prison to <u>them that are bound<\/u>; (61:1)     <br><i>To proclaim the acceptable year<\/i> <u>of the Lord<\/u>,     <br>and the <i>day of vengeance<\/i> <i>of our God;<\/i>     <br><i>to comfort<\/i> <u>all that mourn<\/u>; (61:2)     <br><i>To appoint<\/i> unto <u>them that mourn<\/u> in Zion,     <br>to give unto them <i>beauty<\/i> for <u>ashes<\/u>,     <br>the <i>oil of joy<\/i> for <u>mourning<\/u>,     <br>the <i>garment of praise<\/i> for the <u>spirit of heaviness<\/u>;     <br>that they might be called <i>trees <\/i><u>of righteousness<\/u>,     <br>the <i>planting <\/i><u>of the Lord<\/u>,     <br>that he might be glorified.
