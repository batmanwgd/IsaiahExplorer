Shall I begin a work and not perfect it? <i>Shall I cause to bring forth, and shut the womb <\/i>\u2014That there should not be a continual succession of converts in all ages? Zion shall not bring forth once only, but she shall continue to be fruitful: her womb shall not be shut: she shall every day bring forth more and more children, and my presence shall be with my church to the end of the world. Thus the prophet still carries on the comparison between the natural and the spiritual birth. <\/p> ",
