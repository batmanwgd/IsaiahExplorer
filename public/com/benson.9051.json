And so the prophet signifies the just judgment of God, in scourging them with a rod of their own making. <i>By them beyond the river<\/i>\u2014Euphrates, called the river, by way of eminence, beyond which Assyria lay. <i>By the king of Assyria<\/i>\u2014By the successive kings of the Assyrian empire, Sennacherib, Esar-haddon, and especially by Nebuchadnezzar, who, having subdued the Assyrian monarchy, from thenceforth was king of Assyria as well as of Chaldea. <i>The head and the hair of the feet,<\/i> &c.\u2014This highly parabolical mode of expression is used to denote \u201cthe utter devastation of the country from one end to the other, and the plundering of the people from the highest to the lowest. The hairs of the head are those of the highest order in the state; those of the feet, or lower parts, are the common people: the beard is the king, the high-priest, the very supreme in dignity and majesty: for the eastern people have always held the beard in the highest veneration, and have been extremely jealous of its honour.\u201d<\/p> ",
