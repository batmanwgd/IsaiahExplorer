    "html": " <p>This wonderful prayer or hymn presents an example of how we may praise and worship the Lord. It appears to be the prayer of those who dwell in Zion, or at least those who desire and anticipate the building of Zion. It sets forth the attributes of God, including his graciousness, strength, salvation, exaltation, justice, and righteousness.<\/p> <blockquote>O <i>Lord,<\/i> be gracious unto <u>us<\/u>;     <br><u>we<\/u> have waited for <i>thee:<\/i>     <br>be thou [our] <i>arm<\/i> every <u>morning<\/u><i>,<\/i>     <br>our <i>salvation<\/i> also in the <u>time of trouble<\/u><i>.<\/i> (33:2)     <br>At the <i>noise of the [tumult] the <u>people<\/u> fled;<\/i>     <br>at the <i>lifting up of thyself<\/i> the <u>nations<\/u> were scattered. (33:3)<\/blockquote> <p>And your<sup> <\/sup>spoil shall be gathered <i>like the gathering<\/i> of the <u>caterpillar<\/u>:<\/p> <blockquote> <i>as the running to and fro<\/i> of <u>locusts<\/u> shall he run upon them.

(33:5)     <br>[He will be the sure foundation for your times,     <br>a rich store of salvation and wisdom and knowledge]     <br>the fear of the Lord is his treasure. (33:6)<\/blockquote> ",
