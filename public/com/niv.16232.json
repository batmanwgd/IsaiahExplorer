They are \u201cblind\u201d and \u201cdeaf\u201d (cf. also 42:18\u201319). They are not in a position to give ministry (as in 42:1\u2013 9) but only to receive it. They are once more called into the courtroom along with the \u201cnations\u201d and the \u201cpeoples\u201d (43:9). Once more the question is put to them: What idol has \u201cforetold this\u201d? It is not clear what \u201cthis\u201d refers to. It may denote the coming of Cyrus and the fall of Babylon, though commentators offer a variety of opinions. The indefiniteness of \u201cthis\u201d may encompass the whole of God\u2019s redemptive work in the world.<\/p>     <p>\u2003Now the nations are called on to produce \u201cwitnesses\u201d who can give evidence that any of their gods have made a prediction in the past (\u201cthe former things\u201d) that has then come true. Their silence proves that they have no such evidence. But now the One who is both judge and defendant turns to his blind and deaf servant and says, \u201cYou are my witnesses.\u201d What incredible courage on God\u2019s part to rest his case on evidence like that. It means that God is going to have to do an amazing work on their behalf so that they can be the evidence he deserves.<\/p>     <p>\u2003Verses 10\u201313 relate in general terms what Israel\u2019s relationship is to God and what they know to be true if only they will open their eyes and ears. They have been called into a relationship with God whereby they will \u201cknow\u201d (affective) and \u201cbelieve\u201d (volitional) and \u201cunderstand\u201d (cognitive) that \u201cI am he.\u201d We have already encountered this latter phrase in 41:4, and we will see it twice more in this chapter (43:13, 25; see also 46:4; 48:12; 51:12). This is God\u2019s ultimate statement of identity. A more colloquial translation might say, \u201cI\u2019m the one.\u201d He is the One all society is looking for, the One who made all things, the One to whom all things will return, and therefore the only One who can save (43:11). There is no one else in his category, and the Israelite people have been called in order to experience that truth and demonstrate it to the nations of the world.<\/p>     <p>\u2003This probably explains the interesting combination of verbs in 43:12. God has not merely \u201crevealed\u201d truth about himself to them, nor has he merely \u201csaved\u201d them, nor has he merely \u201cproclaimed\u201d the meaning of what he has done. He has done all three together and simultaneously so that his revelation is a wholistic one, touching the whole of human personality. No one else but the Lord has done this, and the Hebrews know it. They have experienced all of this: They are \u201cwitnesses\u2026that I am God.\u201d The term translated \u201cGod\u201d here is ,<em>el<\/em>, the more inclusive word whose cognates in the Semitic languages almost mean \u201cdeity.\u201d God is saying that he is the totality of deity, as revealed by what he has done on the earth for and through the Israelites. The conclusion in 43:13 is inescapable: There is no one who can successfully contest his will. He is \u201cit\u201d; there is no one else.<\/p>     ",
