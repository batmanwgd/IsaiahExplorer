    "html": " <p>Although all three messianic individuals in Isaiah&rsquo;s olive tree allegory evidence the divine attributes here listed, grammatically they apply to the last one mentioned&mdash;the <em>branch <\/em>&mdash;Jehovah&rsquo;s end-time servant. Word links confirm that identity: &ldquo;My servant whom I sustain, my chosen one in whom I delight, him I have endowed with my Spirit; he will dispense justice to the nations&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDgyXQ==\">Isaiah 42:1<\/a>); &ldquo;He will be called Wonderful Counsellor, One Mighty in Valor&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODM2XQ==\">Isaiah 9:6<\/a>); &ldquo;Because of his knowledge, and by bearing their iniquities, shall my servant, the righteous one, vindicate many&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzIzXQ==\">Isaiah 53:11<\/a>). <\/p> <p>Based on the principle of &ldquo;the one and the many,&rdquo; moreover, those to whom Jehovah&rsquo;s servant ministers, who emulate him (cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODI0XQ==\">Isaiah 8:16<\/a>), come to demonstrate the same divine attributes: &ldquo;My Spirit which is upon you and my words which I have placed in your mouth shall not depart from your mouth&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODIyXQ==\">Isaiah 59:21<\/a>); &ldquo;I have charged my holy ones, called out my valiant ones: my anger is not upon those who take pride in me&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3OTEwXQ==\">Isaiah 13:3<\/a>); &ldquo;Your faithfulness in time [of trial] shall prove to be a strength, your wisdom and knowledge your salvation; your fear of Jehovah shall be your riches&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4Mjg2XQ==\">Isaiah 33:6<\/a>). <\/p> ",
