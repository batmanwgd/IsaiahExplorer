As in ancient Near Eastern emperor-vassal covenants, Jehovah is bound under the terms of the Davidic Covenant to deliver a vassal and his people from a mortal threat when the vassal proves loyal under all conditions. Hezekiah demonstrates this during Jehovah&rsquo;s personalized test of the king&rsquo;s loyalty at the height of his royal career. Now about age forty, Hezekiah is in his prime and at the apex of his power.<\/p><p>The words, &ldquo;I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria; I will protect this city&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4Mzk3XQ==\">v 6<\/a>), and &ldquo;I will protect this city and save it, for my own sake and for the sake of my servant David&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4Mzg4XQ==\">Isaiah 37:35<\/a>), appear as one in<a class=\"ref\"> 2 Kings 20:6<\/a>.

His suffering, in other words, directly impacts Jehovah&rsquo;s deliverance of his people. God thus proves to be <em>with<\/em> this son Immanuel (&ldquo;God Is with Us&rdquo;)&mdash;a vassal who chooses the &ldquo;good&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4Mzk0LDE3Nzk3LDE3Nzk5XQ==\">v 3; Isaiah 7:14, 16<\/a>)&mdash;when the angel slays the Assyrian host (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4Mzg5XQ==\">Isaiah 37:36<\/a>).<\/p>",
