    "title": "Why Did Isaiah Say Jerusalem\u2019s Warfare Was Over?",
    "html": "<p>&ldquo;The message of comfort to Jerusalem, &lsquo;that her warfare is accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned,&rsquo; clearly refers to the latter days. The Anchor Bible translates this line<em>&lsquo;that her sentence is served, her penalty is paid.&rsquo;<\/em> Judah was to be sent through the &lsquo;furnace of affliction&rsquo; (see <a class=\"ref\">48:10<\/a>), so the message given here is to be fulfilled after she has been through the furnace. A look at history and at present-day circumstances shows her still to be going through that furnace. The rest of the chapter also supports a Second Coming time period.&rdquo; (Monte S. Nyman, <em>&ldquo;Great Are the Words of Isaiah,&rdquo;<\/em> pp. 141&ndash;42.)<\/p><p class=\"cite\"> LDS Church Educational System Old Testament Student Manual, 1 Kings&ndash;Malachi, Religion 302, Chapter 16, Item 4<\/p> ",
