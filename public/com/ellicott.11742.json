    "html": "<p>The wicked are like the troubled sea . . .\u2014The promise of healing is, however, not unconditional. The acceptance of peace requires calmness; but for the wicked, whose thoughts are restlessly seething with evil ripening into act, this true peace is, in the nature of the case, impossible. We note the recurrence of the watchword of <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NjM3XQ==\">Isaiah 48:22<\/a>, as indicating the close of another section of the prophecy. The MSS. and versions present a curious variation in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4Nzg3XQ==\">Isaiah 57:21<\/a>: some \u201csaith Jehovah,\u201d some \u201cGod,\u201d some \u201cthe Lord God.\u201d It would almost seem as if transcribers and translators had shrunk from the prophet\u2019s boldness in claiming God as in some special sense his God. It has a parallel, however, in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3Nzk2XQ==\">Isaiah 7:13<\/a>, and may be noted, accordingly, as one of the characteristic touches common to the two parts of Isaiah. The \u201cSea\u201d of which Isaiah speaks may possibly have been the Dead Sea, casting up its salt bituminous deposits. <\/p>",
