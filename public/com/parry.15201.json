    "html": " <p>Isaiah's parable explains how the Lord uses an established plan as he works with his people, who are his \"threshing, and the corn of [his] floor\" (21:10)<i>.<\/i> The lesson presented here is based on the work of the farmer, who plows, plants, and harvests each item in its own way and according to its own time. The Lord has scattered his people at different times in various places; the Lord will gather and thresh his people in order to bring an increase to himself according to appointed times. \"God's strategy for history, like his strategy for agriculture, is wonderful and achieves success. Thus his instruction should be sought by [all the earth's inhabitants], as it is sought and followed by farmers. And his strategy is to be trusted with patient faith.\" <\/p> <blockquote> <i>Give ye ear,<\/i> and <u>hear my voice<\/u>;     <br><i>hearken,<\/i> and <u>hear my speech<\/u>. (28:23)     <br>Doth the <i>plowman<\/i> <u>plow<\/u> all day to sow?     <br>doth <i>he<\/i> <u>open and break the clods of his ground<\/u>? (28:24)     <br>When <i>he<\/i> hath <u>made plain the face<\/u> thereof,     <br>doth he not <i>cast abroad<\/i> the <u>fitches<\/u>,     <br>and <i>scatter<\/i> the <u>cummin<\/u>,     <br>and <i>cast<\/i> in the principal <u>wheat<\/u> and the appointed     <br><u>barley<\/u> and <u>rye<\/u> in their place? (28:25)     <br>For his God doth <i>instruct<\/i> him to discretion,     <br>and doth <i>teach<\/i> him. (28:26)     <br>For the <i>fitches<\/i> are not <u>threshed with a threshing instrument<\/u>,     <br>neither is a <i> <\/i><u>cart wheel turned about <\/u>upon the cummin;     <br>but the <i>fitches<\/i> are beaten out with a <u>staff<\/u>,     <br>and the <i>cummin<\/i> with a <u>rod<\/u>. (28:27)     <br>Bread corn is <i>bruised;<\/i>     <br>because he will not ever be <i>threshing it,<\/i>     <br>nor <i>break it<\/i> <u>with the wheel of his cart<\/u>,     <br>nor <i>bruise it<\/i> <u>with his horsemen<\/u>. (28:28)     <br>This also cometh forth from the Lord of hosts,     <br>which is <i>wonderful<\/i> in <u>counsel<\/u>,     <br>and <i>excellent<\/i> in <u>working<\/u>. (28:29)<\/blockquote> ",
