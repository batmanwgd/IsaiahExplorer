This is followed, as in chapters 42 and 49, with a commentary (50:10\u201351:8). There are two connections with the preceding section: the contrast between the transgressions of Israel (50:1) and the obedience of the Servant (50:5), and the fourfold repetition of \u201cthe Sovereign L<small>ORD<\/small>.\u201d<\/p>     <p>\u2003As far as the structure of the present section is concerned, 49:14\u201350:3 had insisted that the Sovereign Lord (cf. 49:22) has both the power and the will to deliver his people from their sin. But how will he do so? According to 50:4\u20139, he will do it through the obedience of his Servant, even if it means the Servant must suffer to accomplish the Sovereign Lord\u2019s purpose. Then 50:10\u201311, with its comment on the Servant\u2019s words, provides the transition into the body of the commentary (51:1\u20138). Those who \u201cobey the word of his servant\u201d (lit., \u201clisten to the voice of his servant\u201d; note the recurrence of \u201clisten\u201d in 51:1, 4, 7) will have light, while those who manufacture their own light will find destruction. The Servant will speak a message to which those who are seeking God\u2019s \u201crighteousness\u201d will listen (51:1). His \u201cjustice\u201d (not theirs) will be a light to the nations (51:4; cf. 42:1; 49:6), and in him they will find \u201csalvation\u201d (51:8).<\/p>     ",
