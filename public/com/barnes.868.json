    "html": "<p><em>Wo is me!<\/em>&mdash;That is, I am filled with overwhelming convictions of my own unworthiness, with alarm that I have seen Yahweh.<\/p><p><em>For I am undone<\/em>&mdash;Margin, &lsquo;Cut off.&rsquo; Chaldee, &lsquo;I have sinned.&rsquo; Septuagint, &lsquo;I am miserable, I am pierced through.&rsquo; Syriac, &lsquo;I am struck dumb.&rsquo; The Hebrew word may sometimes have this meaning, but it also means &ldquo;to be destroyed, to be ruined, to perish;&rdquo; see <a class=\"ref\">Hosea 10:15; Zephaniah 1:2; Hosea 4:6<\/a> ; <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3OTYyXQ==\">Isaiah 15:1<\/a>. This is probably the meaning here, &lsquo;I shall be ruined, or destroyed.&rsquo; The reason of this, he immediately states.<\/p><p><em>A man of unclean lips<\/em>&mdash;This expression evidently denotes that he was a &ldquo;sinner,&rdquo; and especially that he was unworthy either to join in the praise of a God so holy, or to deliver a message in his name. The vision; the profound worship of the seraphim; and the attendant majesty and glory, had deeply impressed him with a sense of the holiness of God, and of his own unfitness either to join in worship so holy, or to deliver the message of so pure a God. A similar effect is recorded in reference to Abraham; <a class=\"ref\">Genesis 18:27<\/a> ; see also <a class=\"ref\">Exodus 4:10, Exodus 4:12; Jeremiah 1:6<\/a>. A deep consciousness of guilt, in view of the holiness and majesty of God, is also described by Job:<\/p><p>I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear<\/p><p>But now mine eye seeth thee.<\/p><p>Wherefore I abhor myself,<\/p><p>And repent in dust and ashes.<\/p>",
