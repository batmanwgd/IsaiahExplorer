In so doing, they declare the glory of Jehovah among the Gentiles. Those gathered will be honored with the priesthood. Elder Pratt interpreted the sign which was to be sent among them to be the same sign given by the Savior to the Nephites when he ministered among them. This sign was the coming forth of the Book of Mormon, first among the Gentiles and then among the Lamanites (see <i>JD,<\/i> 18:16-17; <a class=\"ref\">3 Ne. 21:1-6<\/a>). Paul was apparently paraphrasing part of verse 20 in <a class=\"ref\">Rom. 15:16<\/a> as justification for his preaching the gospel to the Gentiles.<\/p>     ",
