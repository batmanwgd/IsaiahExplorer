Such violent motions were commonly tokens of God\u2019s anger. And here, it seems, this concussion of the temple was intended to signify God\u2019s displeasure against his people for their sins, and to be a token of its destruction, by the Babylonians first, and afterward by the Romans; <i>and <\/i> <i>the house was filled with smoke <\/i>\u2014Which elsewhere is a token of God\u2019s presence and acceptance, but here, of his anger; and may be considered likewise as an emblem of the darkness and blindness of that generation of Jews, accustomed to worship in that temple, as also of that future generation of the same people, who should worship there in the days of the Messiah, before its second destruction by the Romans. <\/p> ",
