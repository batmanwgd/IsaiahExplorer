    "html": "<p> In <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDMxXQ==\">Isaiah 40:10<\/a> the prophet goes back from the standpoint of the fulfilment to that of the prophecy. <em> \u201cBehold the Lord, Jehovah, as a mighty one will He come, His arm ruling for Him; behold, His reward is with Him, and His retribution before Him.\u201d<\/em> We must not render the first clause \u201cwith strong,\u201d i.e., with strength, as the lxx and Targum do. The <em> Beth<\/em> is <em> Beth essentiae<\/em> (cf., <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTM1XQ==\">Isaiah 26:4<\/a>; Ges. \u00a7154, 3,<em> a<\/em> ). He will come in the essence, strength, and energy of a strong one; and this is still further defined by the participial, circumstantial clause, \u201cHis arm ruling for Him\u201d (<em> brachio suo ipsi dominante <\/em> ). It is His arm that rules for Him, i.e., that either brings into subjection to Him, or else overthrows whatever opposes Him. Nevertheless,  does not present Him merely in one aspect, namely as coming to judge and punish, but in both aspects, viz., that of the law and that of the gospel, as a righteous rewarder; hence the double name of God, <em> Adonai Jehovah<\/em> (compare <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzIzLDE4MTgxLDE4MjMzXQ==\">Isaiah 3:15; Isaiah 28:16; Isaiah 30:15<\/a>, all in the first part), which is used even in the Pentateuch, and most frequently by Amos and Ezekiel, and which forms, as it were, an anagram. \u05e4\u05bc\u05e2\u05dc\u05bc\u05d4 is already met with in <a class=\"ref\">Leviticus 19:13<\/a> as a synonym of \u05e9\u05c2\u05db\u05e8 , passing from the general idea of <em> work<\/em> to that of something earned and forfeited. Jehovah brings with Him the penal reward of the enemies of His people, and also the gracious reward of the faithful of His people, whom He will compensate for their previous sufferings with far exceeding joys (see <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODY2XQ==\">Isaiah 62:11<\/a>).<\/p>",
