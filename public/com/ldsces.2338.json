The &ldquo;prisoners &hellip; gathered in the pit&rdquo; and those &ldquo;shut up in the prison&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 24:22<\/a>) are those locked in the spirit world awaiting the preaching of the gospel (see Joseph Fielding Smith, <em>Doctrines of Salvation,<\/em> 2:155). According to Elder Orson Pratt, the moon will be confounded and the sun will be ashamed because the brilliance which attends Christ in His return to earth will be a &ldquo;superior light,&rdquo; one which will make all else seem dark by comparison (in <em>Journal of Discourses,<\/em> 20:12).<\/p><p class=\"cite\">LDS Church Educational System Old Testament Student Manual, 1 Kings&ndash;Malachi, Religion 302, Chapter 15, Item 6<\/p>",
