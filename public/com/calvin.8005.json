For as necromancy was generally practiced among heathen nations, the Jews also consulted demons \u201cin graves and deserts,\u201d instead of consulting God alone, which they ought to have done; and, as if they were seeking answers from the dead, they took pleasure in being deceived by the illusions of demons. How solemnly the Lord had forbidden it, appears very clearly from <a class=\"ref\">Deuteronomy 18:10<\/a> , and other passages; and we have seen something of this kind in a former part of this book, ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODI3XQ==\">Isaiah 8:19<\/a>.)

( <a class=\"ref\">Leviticus 11:7; Deuteronomy 14:8<\/a>.) This related to the external profession of. faith, by which the Jews were in duty bound to testify how widely they differed from the pollution of the Gentiles. From that rule, therefore, which the Lord enjoins upon us, we must not swerve even a hair\u2019s breadth.<\/p> ",
