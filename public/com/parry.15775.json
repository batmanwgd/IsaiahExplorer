Even though Israel has suffered shame and reproach, both in youth and in old age, in the latter days the Lord will cause these things to be put behind her in the midst of his blessings. <i>Youth<\/i> may refer to Israel's days of sin before the exile; <i>widowhood<\/i> may refer to the time of the exile itself, when Israel was separated from her land and her God. In the day of blessing, Israel will remember no more her days of trial.<\/p> ",
