    "html": " <i>I <b> <\/b>lay in Zion for a foundation a stone. <\/i>This is a prophecy of Jesus Christ, in which he is called a <i>stone,<\/i> a <i>tried stone<\/i> (or a stone tested for strength), and a <i>precious corner stone.<\/i> A cornerstone adds permanence and strength to the foundation of a building. Here the building is the latter-day Zion, and \"he that believeth\" may have a \"sure foundation\" on which to build (<a class=\"ref\">1 Pet. 2:6-8<\/a>). <\/p> <p><i>he that believeth shall not make haste. <\/i>Peter's quotation of Isaiah here reads, \"He that believeth on him shall not be confounded\" (<a class=\"ref\">1 Pet. 2:6<\/a>), and Paul's quotation reads, \"shall not be ashamed\" (<a class=\"ref\">Rom. 9:33; 10:11<\/a>). The meaning of this phrase, then, is: \"Whosoever believes on him [Christ, the stone] shall not be [confounded or] ashamed.\"<\/p> ",
