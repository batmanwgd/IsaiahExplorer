But the clause may be rendered a little otherwise, as indeed it is by divers learned men, thus: <i>And the word of the Lord shall be unto them, precept upon precept, <\/i>,&c.; as this method has been used, and was altogether necessary for them, so it still is, and for the future shall be. As they were children in understanding, they shall continue to be such; they shall be ever learning, and never come to the knowledge of the truth; as they formerly would not, so now they shall not profit by the word, and their sin shall be their punishment. <i>That they may, <\/i>,or <i>might go, and fall backward \u2014 <\/i>,This will be the event, or consequence of their sin: they will fall backward, which is the worst and most dangerous way of falling; and so be broken to pieces. <\/p>,",
