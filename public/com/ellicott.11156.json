True to what we may call the catholicity of his character, Isaiah looks forward to a time when the outlying heathen nations shall no longer be excluded from fellowship with Israel, but shall share in its sacrificial feasts even as at the banquet of the great King. In the Hebrew, as even in the English, the rhythm flows on like a strain of music appropriate to such a feast. The \u201cwines on the lees\u201d are those that have been allowed to ripen and clarify in the cask, and so, like the \u201cfat things full of marrow,\u201d represent the crowning luxuries of an Eastern banquet.<\/p> ",
