    "html": "<p><i>A remnant shall return. <\/i>This is a confirmation of the former statement. Yet in the words  <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05e9\u05d0\u05e8 \u05d9\u05e9\u05d5\u05d1<\/span>, (<i>Shear Yashub<\/i>,) <i>a remnant shall return<\/i>, there appears to be an allusion to that passage in which Isaiah\u2019s son was called <i>Shear-jashub<\/i>. (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTc3ODY=\">Isaiah 7:3<\/a>.) In our observations on it, we stated that this peculiar name was given him in reference to the event, that it might be regarded as a pledge of the future deliverance concerning which his father prophesied. It was necessary that the Jews should be confirmed in various ways, that they might be convinced that the Lord would at length bring them back. This is also the design of what he immediately adds \u2014 <\/p>\n<p><i>To the mighty God; <\/i>that is, to him whom the people, after having returned from their former apostasy, will acknowledge to be the guardian of their salvation. This attribute, <i>mighty<\/i>, is ascribed to God for the sake of the occasion on which the words were used. He might have thought it sufficient to have expressed <i>power <\/i>by the name  <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d0\u05dc<\/span>, (<i>El<\/i>,) <i>God<\/i>, which also signifies <i>mighty<\/i>; but he chose likewise to add to it  <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d2\u05d1\u05d5\u05e8<\/span>, (<i>gibbor<\/i>,) that is, <i>strong <\/i>or <i>mighty<\/i>, in order to excite the people to greater confidence. How was it possible for the people to betake themselves to the Assyrians and Egyptians, but because they did not think that God was sufficient for them? This is the source of all evils, when we are not fully convinced that in God is everything that can be desired for our salvation. <\/p>",
