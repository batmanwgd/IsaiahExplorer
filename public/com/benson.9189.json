The Hebrew,<span class=\"hebrew_text\"> \u05de\u05e9\u05c2\u05dc\u05e9\u05c2\u05dc\u05df \u05e9\u05c2\u05dc\u05e9\u05c2\u05dc\u05d4 \u05d2\u05d1\u05e8<\/span> , is rendered by Dr. Waterland,<i> will throw thee out hence with a mighty throw,<\/i> and may also be rendered,<i> will cast thee away with the casting of a mighty man,<\/i> that is, with great force;<i> and will surely cover thee<\/i> \u2014 Namely, with confusion, as is here implied, and as this phrase is more fully expressed<a class=\"ref\">Psalms 109:29<\/a> . Or, this may be an allusion to the condition of mourners in general, and particularly of condemned persons, whose faces were wont to be covered.<i> He will violently turn and toss thee like a ball<\/i> \u2014 Hebrew,<span class=\"hebrew_text\"> \u05e6\u05e0\u05d5<\/span> \u0160<span class=\"hebrew_text\"> \u05d9\u05e6\u05e0\u05e4\u05df \u05e6\u05e0\u05e4\u05d4 \u05db\u05d3\u05d5\u05e8<\/span> ,<i> rolling he will roll thee with the rolling of a ball; into a large country<\/i> \u2014 Like a ball which is cast into a large and plain spot of ground, where, being thrown with great force, it runs far and wide. Or,<i> to a far country,<\/i> meaning probably Assyria.<i> There shalt thou die<\/i> \u2014 After having lived in obscurity.<i> And the chariots of thy glory shall be the shame of thy lord\u2019s house<\/i> \u2014 The honour thou didst arrive at, and the chariots in which thou didst ride with so much state at Jerusalem, shall turn to thy shame, and to the reproach of those who preferred so unworthy a person. Dr. Waterland translates the verse,<i> He will toss and whirl thee, as he were whirling a ball, &c., and there shall be thy glorious chariots, O thou shame of thy lord\u2019s house. And I will drive thee,<\/i> &c. \u2014 These are the Lord\u2019s words;<i> and from thy state shall he pull thee down<\/i> \u2014 Namely, the Lord shall; such sudden changes of persons being very usual in these writings.<\/p> ",
