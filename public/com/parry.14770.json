The name <i>Immanuel<\/i> (Hebrew, \"God is with us\") is mentioned twice in this section (8:8, 10)\u2014once as the transliteration \"Immanuel\" and again as the translation \"God is with us.\" <i>Immanuel<\/i> serves as a poetic refrain to help the reader recall the sign provided to King Ahaz (7:14-16).<b> <\/b>Immanuel, or Maher-shalal- hash-baz, is a living sign (8:18) to Judah that God (who is \"with us\") will fulfill his promise to bring security and hope to them as nations come upon them. More importantly, <i>Immanuel<\/i> is the name of Jesus Christ, who brings spiritual salvation to Israel. In the end, the world's nations and alliances fail because the power of Immanuel exceeds theirs.<\/p> ",
