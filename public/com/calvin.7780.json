It was to encourage the hearts of believers to cherish the hope of a better condition. He says that he \u201ccalled him <i>one <\/i> or <i>alone,\u201d <\/i> not only because he had none along with him, when he was called out of his country, but because the Lord suffered him to dwell in the land of Canaan without children up to a worn out old age, so that he had no hope of having children, especially because Sarah (<a class=\"ref\">Genesis 16:2<\/a>) also was barren; and when at length, as a solace for their childless condition, one son was given to them, not long afterwards he appeared to be led forth to slaughter. Yet the Lord increased and enriched him with a great number of children. <\/p> \n <p>How needful this consolation was to the Jews has been remarked by me a little before, and may be easily learned from their condition, which history plainly declares to have been wretched and unhappy. To us also, in the present day, amidst this distracted condition of the Church, it is highly necessary, that we may not be discouraged because our number is small, and that we may hope that God will increase his Church by unexpected methods. We behold a very clear and striking testimony of this in the blessing by which the Lord increased, even to extreme old age, the posterity of Abraham, who was childless and solitary. That promise relates not to the Jews only, but to other nations; and on this account also he <\/p> \n <p> <span> \u201cwas no longer called Abram, but Abraham.\u201d \n(<\/span> <a class=\"ref\">Genesis 17:5<\/a>.) <\/p> ",
