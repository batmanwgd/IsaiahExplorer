The word translated here as <i>temple<\/i> (Hebrew <i>heykal<\/i>) also means \"palace,\" as in 39:7 and 13:22. Because the city is where the people live, and the palace where the rulers live, the meaning here may be that the destruction will reach into every dwelling place.<\/p> <p><i>the Lord that rendereth recompence to his enemies.<\/i> The Lord will bring the appropriate judgment upon all those who fight against him, according to their works.<\/p> ",
