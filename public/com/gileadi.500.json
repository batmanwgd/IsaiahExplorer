    "html": " <p>The destruction of Jehovah&rsquo;s enemies and the deliverance of his elect in a new exodus (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODUyMCI6NH0=\">vv 14-17 <\/a>) form the centerpiece of the chiastic structure of thirty alternating chaos and creation motifs in chapters 41-46. Those who subscribe to Greater Babylon&rsquo;s materialistic economy&mdash;the manufacture, promotion, and sale of idols, the works of men&rsquo;s hands&mdash;ultimately turn into &ldquo;fugitives&rdquo;&mdash;a chaos motif (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NTc4LDE4NTgyXQ==\">Isaiah 45:16, 20 <\/a>). Depending on Greater Babylon&rsquo;s worldwide shipping empire for their livelihood, they put their trust in what is destined to pass away (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxNzcwMiwxNzkyNiwxODAzOCwxODA0NV0seyIxODA3OSI6MTR9LFsxODYwMSwxODYxMV1d\">Isaiah 2:16; 13:19; 21:2, 9; 23:1-14; 47:1, 11 <\/a>). <\/p> <p>Jehovah&rsquo;s depiction as his people&rsquo;s &ldquo;Redeemer&rdquo; identifies how he redeems them&mdash;in this case, by vanquishing their enemies the Chaldeans or Babylonians. His depiction as his people&rsquo;s &ldquo;King&rdquo; attests to his emperor-vassal type of relationship with them and with individuals under the terms of the Sinai and Davidic Covenants. His designation as Israel&rsquo;s &ldquo;Holy One&rdquo; expresses his role as the exemplar of his people. His designation as &ldquo;Creator&rdquo; of Israel&mdash;a creation motif&mdash;reflects his people&rsquo;s re-creation on a higher level (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NTA3LDE4NTU1LDE4OTE2XQ==\">v 1; Isaiah 44:21; 65:18 <\/a>), qualifying them for the deliverance that follows. <\/p> ",
