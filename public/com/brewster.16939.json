Victor Ludlow points out that \"in a praise psalm, attention is centered upon the person being extolled, but in a thanks psalm the viewpoint is focused on the person giving thanks and upon the blessing that he has received. The first psalm of chapter 12 is in the 'thanks' category; the second is more of a 'praise' type.\" (IPSP, 179.)<\/p>     <table>         <tbody>             <tr>                 <td>4 And in that day shall ye say<u>,<\/u> Praise the Lord, call upon his name, declare his doings among the people, make mention that his name is exalted.                     <br>                     <br>5 Sing unto the Lord; for he hath done excellent things<u>:<\/u> this is known in all the earth.                     <br>                     <br>6 Cry out and shout, thou inhabitant of Zion<u>:<\/u> for great is the Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee.                     <br>                 <\/td>                 <td>4 And in that day shall ye say<u>:<\/u> Praise the Lord, call upon his name, declare his doings among the people, make mention that his name is exalted.                     <br>                     <br>5 Sing unto the Lord; for he hath done excellent things<u>;<\/u> this is known in all the earth.                     <br>                     <br>6 Cry out and shout, thou inhabitant of Zion<u>;<\/u> for great is the Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee.                     <br>                 <\/td>             <\/tr>         <\/tbody>     <\/table>",
