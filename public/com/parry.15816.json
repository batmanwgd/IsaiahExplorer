In this passage, the watchmen themselves have become apostates. In 56:11, they are referred to as shepherds who have turned from their care of the flock. Like watchdogs who have become lazy, blind, and incapacitated, or like shepherds who have lost sight of their calling and are no longer able to recognize the enemy, these watchmen have left off caring for their flock and have turned instead to caring for their own needs and desires (<a class=\"ref\">Jer. 6:17; Ezek. 3:17<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\"> 34:1<\/a>). <\/p> <p>Besides describing Israel's religious leaders in ancient times, this prophecy may also refer to leaders of apostate religions in our day (<a class=\"ref\">2 Ne. 28:3-9; Morm. 8:31-33<\/a>, <a class=\"ref\"> 37-39<\/a>). <\/p> ",
