Nothing can be more absurd than for a man to assume the right to create a god, not only because he had a beginning, while God is eternal, but because not even for a single moment does he subsist by his own power. Let the whole world collect all its strength into a single man, he will not even be able to create a fica. What presumption is it, therefore, that every mortal man shall make for himself either one god or many! Since, therefore, there is nothing in us but what is frail and fading, we shall never be able to produce a deity. <\/p> \n <p>Besides, it is in the highest degree absurd to attempt, as an exercise of skill, to frame some deity out of matter which is corruptible and devoid of feeling, as if \u201cwood or stone,\u201d whenever it received a shape, began to be a god. In this manner, therefore, all the superstitions that men have ever invented are speedily overturned; for the existence of those gods can be found nowhere but in their own brains, and, indeed, all that they have of themselves contrived is condemned as empty and false. <\/p> ",
