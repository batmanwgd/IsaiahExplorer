Elder Orson Pratt wrote: &ldquo;The Zion that is here spoken of is called to &lsquo;arise and shine, for the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee.&rsquo; There is no one thing more fully revealed in the Scriptures of eternal truth, than the rise of the Zion of our God in the latter days, clothed upon with the glory of God from the heavens&mdash;a Zion that will attract the attention of all the nations and kindreds of the whole earth. It will not be something that takes place in a corner on some distant island of the sea, or away among some obscure people; but it will be something that will call forth the attention of all people and nations upon the face of the whole earth.&rdquo; (In<em>Journal of Discourses,<\/em> 16:78.)<\/p><p class=\"cite\"> LDS Church Educational System Old Testament Student Manual, 1 Kings&ndash;Malachi, Religion 302, Chapter 18, Item 15<\/p> ",
