Their &ldquo;works&rdquo; or institutions are the spark that sets off the conflagration. &ldquo;Refuse,&rdquo; a chaos motif, signifies the disintegration of the old society before the new&mdash;the community of Zion or Jerusalem&mdash;takes its place (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 2:2-4<\/a>). Jehovah appoints the king of Assyria\/Babylon as his instrument for burning up the wicked of his people and the nations (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxNzY2Ml0seyIxNzg0OCI6Mn0seyIxNzg1NiI6M30sWzE4MjgxXSx7IjE4MjkyIjozfSxbMTg2MTRdXQ==\">v 7; Isaiah 9:18-19; 10:5-7; 33:1, 12-14; 47:14<\/a>).
