    "html": "<p>The &ldquo;mighty&rdquo;&mdash;the icons of society&mdash;become but burnt refuse as Jehovah cleanses the earth of wickedness. Their &ldquo;works&rdquo; or institutions are the spark that sets off the conflagration. &ldquo;Refuse,&rdquo; a chaos motif, signifies the disintegration of the old society before the new&mdash;the community of Zion or Jerusalem&mdash;takes its place (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc2ODgiOjN9XQ==\">Isaiah 2:2-4<\/a>). Jehovah appoints the king of Assyria\/Babylon as his instrument for burning up the wicked of his people and the nations (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc2OTMiOjF9LHsiMTc4NDgiOjJ9LHsiMTc4NTYiOjN9LHsiMTgyODEiOjR9LHsiMTg2MTQiOjF9XQ==\">v 7; Isaiah 9:18-19; 10:5-7; 33:1, 12-14; 47:14<\/a>). Jehovah ordained this archtyrant&rsquo;s cleansing of the earth &ldquo;long ago... in days of old&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgzNzkiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 37:26<\/a>).<\/p>",
