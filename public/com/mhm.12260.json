I. Let them not be afraid of the idols of Babylon, as if they could in  any way obstruct their deliverance, for they should be defaced  (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 46:1<\/a>)  but let them trust in that God who had often delivered them to do it  still, to do it now,   <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 46:3<\/a>.  II. Let them not think to make idols of their own, images of the God of  Israel, by them to worship him, as the Babylonians worship their gods,   <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 46:5-7<\/a>.  Let them not be so sottish  (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 46:8<\/a>),  but have an eye to God in his word, not in an image  let them depend  upon that, and upon the promises and predictions of it, and God's power  to accomplish them all,   <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 46:9-11<\/a>.  And let them know that the unbelief of man shall not make the word of  God of no effect,   <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 46:12<\/a>.<\/p>",
