Symbolically, the scriptures consistently use trees to represent men. Green trees are righteous people (<a class=\"ref\">Ps. 1:3; D&amp;C 135:6<\/a>), and dry trees represent the wicked (<a class=\"ref\">Luke 23:31; 3 Ne. 14:17-18<\/a>). In the context of <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzY5NyI6MTF9\">Isa. 2:11-21<\/a>, oaks and cedars are like proud people, who, Isaiah informs us, are \"high and lifted up,\" and the \"day of the Lord\" shall come upon them too.<\/p> ",
