    "html": "<p>A series of seven &ldquo;woes&rdquo; or covenant curses follows Isaiah&rsquo;s vineyard allegory, detailing a cross-section of hedonistic behaviors that underscores the unjust and unprincipled standards by which Jehovah&rsquo;s end-time people live. A spirit of speculation overcomes them&mdash;as manifested by oppressive zoning laws, for-profit property developments, corporate mergers, and other questionable entrepreneurial ventures&mdash;forcing the poor of his people out of rural, self-sustaining lifestyles into the cities or centers of the land. Only his people who are thus disenfranchised Jehovah acknowledges as &ldquo;you.&rdquo;<\/p> ",
