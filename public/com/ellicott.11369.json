He is described in Assurbanipal\u2019s inscriptions (Records of the Past, i. 60) as king of Mizr and Cush\u2014i.e., Egypt and Ethiopia. The policy of Hezekiah\u2019s counsellors had led them to court his alliance, as in Isaiah 30, 31. Now, however, the Egyptian army was at least mobilised. \u201cRahab\u201d was no longer \u201csitting still\u201d (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 30:7<\/a>).<\/p>\n <p>When he heard it.\u2014The message is in substance a repetition of its predecessors, more defiant, perhaps, as if in answer to the threatened attack of Tirhakah\u2019s armies, which Sennacherib could scarcely fail to connect with Hezekiah\u2019s confident hope of deliverance.<\/p>",
