The answer to this is given in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODk4XQ==\">Isaiah 11:13<\/a> : <em> \u201cAnd the jealousy of Ephraim is removed, and the adversaries of Judah are cut off; Ephraim will not show jealousy towards Judah, and Judah will not oppose Ephraim.\u201d<\/em> As the suffix and genitive after <em> tzo\u0304re\u0304r <\/em> are objective in every other instance (e.g., <a class=\"ref\">Amos 5:12<\/a>), <em> tzor e re\u0304 Yehuda\u0302h <\/em> must mean, not those members of Judah who are hostile to Ephraim, as Ewald, Knobel, and others suppose, but those members of Ephraim who are hostile to Judah, as Umbreit and Schegg expound it. In  the prophet has chiefly in his mind the old feeling of enmity cherished by the northern tribes, more especially those of Joseph, towards the tribe of Judah, which issued eventually in the division of the kingdom. It is only in  that he predicts the termination of the hostility of Judah towards Ephraim. The people, when thus brought home again, would form one fraternally united nation, whilst all who broke the peace of this unity would be exposed to the immediate judgment of God (<em> yicca\u0302re\u0304thu <\/em> , will be cut off).<\/p>",
