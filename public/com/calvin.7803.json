Why then does the Prophet make use of the imperative mood? for it is unreasonable to demand what we cannot perform. I reply, the imperative form of address has a much more powerful tendency to arouse than if he had employed plain narrative; and therefore he declares that, when God shall have restored her to her former freedom, she shall come out of the mire.<\/p> \n<p><i>Sit, O Jerusalem,. <\/i> The word \u201csit\u201d denotes a flourishing condition, and is contrasted with the word \u201cto lie,\u201d which denotes the lowest calamity. Sometimes indeed it means \u201cto be prostrate,\u201d as when he formerly said to Babylon, \u201csit in the dust.\u201d ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NjAxXQ==\">Isaiah 47:1<\/a>.) But here the meaning is different; for, after ordering her to arise, he likewise adds, \u201cthat she may sit;\u201d that is, that she may no longer lie down, but may regain her former condition, and not be in future laid prostrate by enemies.<\/p> ",
