But through the deliverance that God will send, she will yet receive the wealth (\"labour,\" \"merchandise\") and respect (\"fall down unto thee,\" \"make supplication\") of many nations (45:14). The peoples of these nations will confess the true God (\"Surely God is in thee,\" 45:14), while those who make and worship idols will be \"ashamed\" and \"confounded\" (45:16). But Israel \"shall not be ashamed nor confounded world without end\" (45:17). We are all in bondage to sin, but if we qualify, the Lord will give us rich blessings and will stand by us eternally.<\/p> <blockquote>Thus saith the Lord,     <br>The <i>labour<\/i> of <u>Egypt<\/u>,     <br>and <i>merchandise<\/i> of <u>Ethiopia<\/u> and of the <u>Sabeans<\/u>,     <br><i>men of stature,<\/i> shall <u>come over unto thee<\/u>,     <br>and <i>they<\/i> shall <u>be thine<\/u>:     <br><i>they<\/i> shall <u>come after thee<\/u><i>;<\/i>     <br>in chains <i>they<\/i> shall <u>come over<\/u>,     <br>and <i>they<\/i> shall <u>fall down unto thee<\/u>,     <br><i>they<\/i> shall <u>make supplication unto thee<\/u>, saying,     <br>Surely God is in thee; and <i>there is <\/i><u>none else<\/u>,     <br><i>there is <\/i><u>no God<\/u>.
