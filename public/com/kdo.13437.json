    "html": " <p>He who created all things, and called all things into existence, had also raised up this Cyrus, whose victorious career had increased the anxieties and fears of the exiles, instead of leading them to lift up their heads, because their redemption was drawing nigh. <i>\u201cI, I have raised him up in righteousness, and all his ways shall I make smooth: He will build my city, and release my banished ones, not for price nor for reward, saith Jehovah of hosts.\u201d <\/i> All the anxieties of the exiles are calmed by the words \u201cin righteousness,\u201d which trace back the revolutions that Cyrus was causing to the righteousness of Jehovah, i.e., to His interposition, which was determined by love alone, and tended directly to the salvation of His people, and in reality to that of all nations. And they are fully quieted by the promise, which is now expressed in the clearest and most unequivocal words, that Cyrus would build up Jerusalem again, and set the captivity free ((<span class=\"translit\"> ga\u0302lu\u0304th <\/span>), as in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MDM0XQ==\">Isaiah 20:4 <\/a>), and that without redemption with money (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzAwXQ==\">Isaiah 52:3 <\/a>) - a clear proof that Jehovah had not only raised up Cyrus himself, but had put his spirit within him, i.e., had stirred up within him the resolution to do this (see the conclusion to the books of Chronicles, and the introduction to that of Ezra). This closes the first half of our sixth prophecy. <br> <\/p> ",
