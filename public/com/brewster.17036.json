How did the unlearned young man accomplish this great task? Here is his own testimony: \"Through the medium of the Urim and Thummim I translated the record by the gift and power of God.\" (HC 4:537.) While a special instrument had been prepared to assist Joseph in the process of translation, it should be remembered that the Urim and Thummim could be used only by chosen seers who possessed the gift and power of God.<\/p>",
