By quoting from Isaiah, Jacob is again seeking to reaffirm that the people of Nephi are a part of the covenant people and that the promises made to the house of Israel apply to them. He also wanted them to know that those at Jerusalem had already been scattered but that after rejecting the Messiah they would in due time be gathered again (see 2 Nephi 6:8\u201311).  <\/p>  <h4>What Are the Trees?<\/h4>  <ul>  <li>  Christ (this chapter is a conversation between Christ and covenant Israel)  <\/li>  <li>  Covenant Israel (covenant Israel will be gathered amid great joy)  <\/li>  <li>  Coming Events (the Lord will fulfill his covenants in the last days)  <\/li>  <\/ul>  <h4>What Keys Can We Use?<\/h4>  <ul>  <li>  Learn the Manner of Prophesying (look for symbols of slavery and spiritual awakening)  <\/li>  <li>  Have the Spirit of Prophecy (read prayerfully)  <\/li>  <li>  Live in the Last Days (latter-day events described, clarified in D&amp;C 113)  <\/li>  <\/ul>  <h4>Overview of 2 Nephi 8 in One Paragraph<\/h4>  <p>  Look to your origins\u2014you are Abraham's seed!
