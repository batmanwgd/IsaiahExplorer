But there have always been a few who remained faithful to Jehovah and his law. For the sake of these few good grapes he has refrained from altogether destroying the vineyard. In the end, though, only the good clusters will be saved, and the rest of the unfruitful people will be destroyed (1:9, 27-28; 4:3-4).<\/p> <p><i>Destroy it not; for a blessing is in it.<\/i> This expression may have been part of a vintage song (16:10; <a class=\"ref\">Jer. 25:30<\/a>). The grape cluster should not be destroyed, they say, because of the good juice in it. This image symbolizes the Lord's treatment of Israel\u2014he promises not to destroy the whole of Israel because of the good people who remain.<\/p> <p><i>for my servants' sakes.<\/i> Because of the goodness of a few, who are his servants, the Lord will not destroy the whole cluster (see commentary on 63:17).<\/p> ",
