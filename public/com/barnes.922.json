    "html": "<p><em>And they shall pass<\/em>&mdash;The people who have been consulting necromancers. This represents the condition of these who have sought for counsel and direction, and who have not found it. They shall be conscious of disappointment, and shall wander perplexed and alarmed through the land.<\/p><p><em>Through it<\/em>&mdash;Through the land. They shall wander in it from one place to another, seeking direction and relief.<\/p><p><em>Hardly bestead<\/em>&mdash;Oppressed, borne down, agitated. The meaning is, that the people would wander about, oppressed by the calamities that were coming upon the nation, and unalleviated by all that soothsayers and necromancers could do.<\/p><p><em>And hungry<\/em>&mdash;Famished; as one effect of the great calamities that would afflict the nation.<\/p><p><em>They shall fret themselves<\/em>&mdash;They shall be irritated at their own folly and weakness, and shall aggravate their sufferings by self-reproaches for having trusted to false gods.<\/p><p><em>Their king and their God<\/em>&mdash;The Hebrew interpreters understand this of the false gods which they bad consulted, and in which they had trusted. But their looking upward, and the connection, seem to imply that they would rather curse the true God&mdash;the &lsquo;king and the God&rsquo; of the Jewish people. They would be subjected to the proofs of his displeasure, and would vent their malice by reproaches and curses.<\/p><p><em>And look upward<\/em>&mdash;For relief. This denotes the condition of those in deep distress, instinctively casting their eyes to heaven for aid. Yet it is implied that they would do it with no right feeling, and that they would see there only the tokens of their Creator&rsquo;s displeasure.<\/p> ",
