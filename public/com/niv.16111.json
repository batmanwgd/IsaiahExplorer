As noted at the end of chapter 1, Isaiah is clearly concerned that no one fails to deal with present sins because of a false security in the certainty of future hope. Whatever good the future may hold, the present is dark indeed. At the center of that ominous present is human arrogance\u2014and that is the theme that unites 2:6\u20134:1.<\/p>     <p>\u2003But the theme is not merely arrogance; it is the humiliation that arrogance necessarily brings upon itself. Because Israel and Judah have been seduced by human power and glory and have consequently abandoned the Creator in whom the only true glory exists, they are doomed to be terribly humiliated. The theme is addressed in three sections. In the first (2:6\u201322) is a general statement of the principle. The second (3:1\u201315) is a specific illustration of the principle, while the third (3:16\u20134:1) is an even more specific illustration.<\/p>     ",
