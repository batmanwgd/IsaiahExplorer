    "html": "<p>This chapter relates to the same events as the foregoing chapter, the distress of Judah and Jerusalem by Sennacherib's invasion and their deliverance out of that distress by the destruction of the Assyrian army. These are intermixed in the prophecy, in the way of a Pindaric. Observe, I. The great distress that Judah and Jerusalem should then be brought into, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODI4NyI6M30=\">Isaiah 33:7-9<\/a> . II. The particular frights which the sinners in Zion should then be in, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MjkzXQ==\">Isaiah 33:13<\/a> . III. The prayers of good people to God in this distress, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MjgyXQ==\">Isaiah 33:2<\/a> . IV. The holy security which they should enjoy in the midst of this trouble, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4Mjk1XQ==\">Isaiah 33:15<\/a> . V. The destruction of the army of the Assyrians (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODI4MSI6M30=\">Isaiah 33:1-3<\/a>), in which God would be greatly glorified, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4Mjg1XQ==\">Isaiah 33:5<\/a> . VI. The enriching of the Jews with the spoil of the Assyrian camp, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4Mjg0XQ==\">Isaiah 33:4<\/a> . VII. The happy settlement of Jerusalem, and the Jewish state, upon this. Religion shall be uppermost (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4Mjg2XQ==\">Isaiah 33:6<\/a>), and their civil state shall flourish, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODI5NyI6Nn0=\">Isaiah 33:17-22<\/a> . This was soon fulfilled, but is written for our learning.<\/p> ",
