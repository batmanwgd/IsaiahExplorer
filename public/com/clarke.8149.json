There is something exceedingly affecting in this complaint. I am a man of unclean lips; I cannot say, Holy, holy, holy! which the seraphs exclaim. They are holy; I am not so: they see God, and live; I have seen him, and must die, because I am unholy. Only the pure in heart shall see God; and they only can live in his presence for ever, Reader, lay this to heart; and instead of boasting of thy excellence, and trusting in thy might, or comforting thyself in thy comparative innocence, thou wilt also be dumb before him, because thou hast been a man of unclean lips, and because thou hast still an unclean heart. <\/p>,\n\n <p> <em>I am undone \"I am struck dumb\"\u2014 <\/em> <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05e0\u05d3\u05de\u05d9\u05ea\u05d9 <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">,nidmeythi <\/span>,, twenty-eight MSS.
