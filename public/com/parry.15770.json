Rather than there being only one land of Zion, she will be established in many stakes.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>The Lord tells us not to fear. He remembers all his promises to establish Zion in the latter days. The Saints may at times have cause to feel forsaken, but the Lord has not forgotten us, and he will have mercy on us. Even if the mountains were to flee, he would not forget his covenant, and his mercy would continue. He will establish the righteous in the beautiful city of New Jerusalem. All our enemies will be put down.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>These promises give comfort to us as a people and as individuals. The Lord will not forget us in our trouble. He always reaches out to comfort and to bless. He will bring us, individually, to his precious promises, if we are worthy.<\/i><\/p> ",
