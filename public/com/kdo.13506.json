    "html": " <p>The description now passes over to the social and judicial life. Lying and oppression universally prevail. <i>\u201cNo one speaks with justice, and no one pleads with faithfulness; men trust in vanity, and speak with deception; they conceive trouble, and bring forth ruin. They hatch basilisks' eggs, and weave spiders' webs. He that eateth of their eggs must die; and if one is trodden upon, it splits into an adder. Their webs do not suffice for clothing, and men cannot cover themselves with their works: their works are works of ruin, and the practice of injustice is in their hands.\u201d<\/i>, As <span class=\"normal hebrew\">,\u05e7\u05e8\u05d0<\/span>, is generally used in these prophetic addresses in the sense of <span class=\"greek normal\">,\u03ba\u03b7\u03c1\u03c5\u0301\u03c3\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd<\/span>, and the judicial meaning, <i>citare<\/i>, <i>in just vocare<\/i>, <i>litem intendere<\/i>, cannot be sustained, we must adopt this explanation, \u201cno one gives public evidence with justice\u201d (lxx <span class=\"greek normal\">,\u03bf\u03c5\u0313\u03b4\u03b5\u03b9\u0300\u03c2 \u03bb\u03b1\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u0342 \u03b4\u03b9\u0301\u03ba\u03b1\u03b9\u03b1 <\/span>). <span class=\"normal hebrew\">,\u05e6\u05d3\u05e7<\/span>, is firm adherence to the rule of right and truth; <span class=\"normal hebrew\">,\u05d0\u05de\ufb35\u05e0\u05d4<\/span>, a conscientious reliance which awakens trust; <span class=\"normal hebrew\">,\u05de\u05e9\u05c1\ufb44\u05d8<\/span>,(in a reciprocal sense, as in <a class=\"ref\">;<\/a>) signifies the commencement and pursuit of a law-suit with any one. The abstract infinitives which follow in <i> <a class=\"ref\"><\/a><\/i>, express the general characteristics of the social life of that time, after the manner of the historical infinitive in Latin (cf., <a class=\"ref\"><\/a>; Ges. \u00a7131, 4, <i>b <\/i>). Men trust in <i>(<span class=\"translit\">, to\u0304hu\u0304 <\/span>), that which is perfectly destitute of truth, and speak <span class=\"normal hebrew\">,\u05e9\u05c1\u05d5\u05d0<\/span>, what is morally corrupt and worthless.

What they carry about with them and set in operation is compared in <i> <a class=\"ref\"><\/a><\/i>, to basilisks' eggs (<span class=\"normal hebrew\">,\u05e6\u05e4\u05e2\u05d5\u05e0\u05d9<\/span>, <i>serpens regulus<\/i>, as in <a class=\"ref\"><\/a>) and spiders' webs (<span class=\"normal hebrew\">,\u05e2\ufb3b\u05d1\u05d9\u05e9\u05c1<\/span>, as in <a class=\"ref\"><\/a>, from <span class=\"normal hebrew\">,\u05e2\ufb3b\u05d1<\/span>, possibly in the sense of squatter, sitter still, with the substantive ending <i>(<span class=\"translit\">,\u0131\u0304sh <\/span>)). They hatch basilisks' eggs (<span class=\"normal hebrew\">,\ufb31\ufb47\u05e2<\/span>, like <span class=\"normal hebrew\">,\ufb31\u05e7\u05e2<\/span>, <a class=\"ref\"><\/a>, a perfect, denoting that which has hitherto always taken place and therefore is a customary thing); and they spin spiders' webs (<span class=\"normal hebrew\">,\u05d0\u05e8\u05d2<\/span>, possibly related to <span class=\"greek normal\">,\u03b1\u0313\u03c1\u03b1\u0301\u03c7-\u03bd\u03b7<\/span>,; <\/i> <\/i> <\/p> <i> <i>\n\n\n\n <\/i> <\/i> <p>(Note: Neither <span class=\"greek normal\">,\u03ba\u03b1\u03b9\u0342\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2<\/span>, nor <span class=\"greek normal\">,\u03b1\u0313\u03c1\u03b1\u0301\u03c7\u03bd\u03b7<\/span>, has hitherto been traced to an Indian root in any admissible way. Benfey deduces the former from the root <i>(<span class=\"translit\">, dhvir <\/span>) (to twist); but this root has to perform an immense number of services. M.

The point of comparison in the first figure is the injurious nature of all they do, whether men rely upon it, in which case \u201che that eateth of their eggs dieth,\u201d or whether they are bold or imprudent enough to try and frustrate their plans and performances, when that (the egg) which is crushed or trodden upon splits into an adder, i.e., sends out an adder, which snaps at the heel of the disturber of its rest. <span class=\"normal hebrew\">,\u05d6\ufb35\u05e8<\/span>, as in <a class=\"ref\"><\/a>, here the part. pass. fem. like <span class=\"normal hebrew\">,\u05e1\ufb35\u05e8\u05d4<\/span>,(<a class=\"ref\"><\/a>), with (<span class=\"translit\">, a <\/span>) - instead of (<span class=\"translit\">, a\u0304 <\/span>) - like <span class=\"normal hebrew\">,\u05dc\u05e0\u05d4<\/span>, the original (<span class=\"translit\">, a\u0306 <\/span>) of the feminine ((<span class=\"translit\">, zu\u0304ra\u0306th <\/span>)) having returned from its lengthening into (<span class=\"translit\">, a\u0304 <\/span>) to the weaker lengthening into (<span class=\"translit\">, e\u0306 <\/span>). The point of comparison in the second figure is the worthlessness and deceptive character of their works. What they spin and make does not serve for a covering to any man (<span class=\"normal hebrew\">,\u05d9\u05ea\ufb3b\ufb41\ufb35<\/span>, with the most general subject: Ges. \u00a7137, 3), but has simply the appearance of usefulness; their works are <span class=\"normal hebrew\">,\u05de\u05e2\u05e9\u05c2\u05d9\u05be\u05d0\u05d5\u05df<\/span>,(with metheg, not munach, under the Mem), evil works, and their acts are all directed to the injury of their neighbour, in his right and his possession. <br> <\/p>",
