    "html": " <p>Jehovah pledges His name and honour that this work of the Servant of Jehovah will be carried into effect. <i>\u201cI am Jehovah; that is my name, and my glory I give not to another, nor my renown to idols.\u201d <\/i> That is His name, which affirms how truly He stands alone in His nature, and recals to mind the manifestations of His life, His power, and His grace from the very earliest times (cf., <a class=\"ref\">Exodus 3:15 <\/a>). He to whom this name belongs cannot permit the honour due to Him to be permanently transferred to sham gods. He has therefore made preparations for putting an end to idolatry. Cyrus does this provisionally by the tempestuous force of arms; and the Servant of Jehovah completes it by the spiritual force of His simple word, and of His gentle, unselfish love. <br> <\/p> ",
