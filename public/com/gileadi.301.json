Although Jehovah shows them favor the same as the righteous, the wicked remain perverse or unrighteous and reject Jehovah&rsquo;s <em>righteousness<\/em>&mdash;his servant. Spiritually blind, they recognize neither Jehovah&rsquo;s <em>hand<\/em> of deliverance nor his <em>hand<\/em> of destruction (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 14:26-27; 41:10, 13<\/a>).<\/p>",
