    "html": "<p> Thus robbed of its support, and torn out of its proper groove, the kingdom of Judah would fall a prey to the most shameless despotism: <em> \u201cAnd I give them boys for princes, and caprices shall rule over them.\u201d<\/em> The revived \u201cSolomonian\u201d glory is followed, as before, by the times of Rehoboam. The king is not expressly named. This was intentional. He had sunk into the mere shadow of a king: it was not he who ruled, but the aristocratic party that surrounded him, who led him about in leading strings as <em> unum inter pares <\/em> . Now, if it is a misfortune in most cases for a king to be a child (<em> na'ar <\/em> , <a class=\"ref\">Ecclesiastes 10:16<\/a>), the misfortune is twice as great when the princes or magnates who surround and advise him are youngsters (<em> ne'a\u0302rim <\/em> , i.e., young lords) in a bad sense. It produces a government of <em> ta\u0302lulim <\/em> . None of the nouns in this form have a personal signification. According to the primary meaning of the verbal stem, the word might signify childishnesses, equivalent to little children (the abstract for the concrete, like \u03c4\u03b1\u0313\u03c0\u03b1\u03b9\u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u0301 <em> amasius <\/em> ), as Ewald supposes; or puppets, <em> fantocci <\/em> , poltroons, or men without heart or brain, as Luzzatto maintains. But the latter has no support in the general usage of the language, and the verb <em> yimshelu <\/em> (shall rule) does not necessarily require a personal subject (cf., <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 19:14; Psalms 103:19<\/a>). The word <em> ta\u0302lulim <\/em> is formed from the reflective verb <em> hithallel <\/em> , which means to meddle, to gratify one's self, to indulge one's caprice. Accordingly <em> ta\u0302lulim <\/em> itself might be rendered <em> vexationes <\/em> (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4OTI3XQ==\">Isaiah 66:4<\/a>). Jerome, who translates the word <em> effeminati <\/em> , appears to have thought of \u05d4\u05ea\u05e2\u05dc\u05bc\u05dc in an erotic sense. The Sept. rendering, \u03b5\u0313\u03bc\u03c0\u03b1\u03b9\u0342\u03ba\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 is better, though \u03b5\u0313\u03bc\u03c0\u03b1\u03b9\u0301\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1 would be more exact. When used, as the word is here, along with <em> ne'arim <\/em> , it signifies outbursts of youthful caprice, which do injury to others, whether in joke or earnest. Neither law nor justice would rule, but the very opposite of justice: a course of conduct which would make subjects, like slaves, the helpless victims at one time of their lust (<a class=\"ref\">Judges 19:25<\/a>), and at another of their cruelty. They would be governed by lawless and bloodstained caprice, of the most despotic character and varied forms. And the people would resemble their rulers: their passions would be let loose, and all restraints of modesty and decorum be snapt asunder.<\/p>",
