    "html": " <p>With the servant&rsquo;s appearance to prepare the way for Jehovah&rsquo;s coming to reign on the earth, direct divine revelation resumes (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODE3NCwxODE4MV0seyIxODQyMiI6M30sWzE4NDc5LDE4NDkwXSx7IjE4NjIxIjozfSxbMTg2MzFdXQ==\">Isaiah 28:9, 16; 40:1-3; 41:27; 42:9; 48:6-8, 16<\/a>). Jehovah&rsquo;s people have but to inquire of Jehovah and to call upon him&mdash;whether through his servant or in their effectual personal prayers&mdash;and he will graciously respond. As Jehovah&rsquo;s spokesman (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzQ1XQ==\">v 4<\/a>)&mdash;his <em>mouth <\/em> and <em>voice <\/em> (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODg5LDE4MTg4LDE4NDI0LDE4NjM5LDE4NjczXQ==\">Isaiah 11:4; 28:23; 40:3; 49:2; 50:10<\/a>)&mdash;the servant appeals to them to repent of their transgressions. As they do so, they find Jehovah &ldquo;present&rdquo; and &ldquo;near&rdquo;&mdash;literally, in person (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzAzXQ==\">Isaiah 52:6<\/a>). <\/p> <p>Unfortunately, many of Jehovah&rsquo;s people have grown weary of him (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg0NDgiOjR9LFsxODY2N11d\">Isaiah 40:27-30; 50:4<\/a>) and don&rsquo;t inquire of him or call upon him (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODI3LDE3ODQzLDE4MjIwLDE4NTI4LDE4ODk5XQ==\">Isaiah 8:19; 9:13; 30:2; 43:22; 65:1<\/a>). Because the verb &ldquo;return&rdquo; (<em>swb<\/em>) also means &ldquo;repent&rdquo; (<em>swb<\/em>) (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzgwLDE4MDQ4LDE4MjU3LDE4NTU2LDE4ODIxXQ==\">Isaiah 6:10; 21:12; 31:6; 44:22; 59:20<\/a>), repentance is here defined as calling upon Jehovah, forsaking sinful thoughts, and refraining from evil ways. Only on those conditions does Jehovah mercifully pardon their faults. Without mercy, his justice alone operates, implying a prolongation of covenant curses until such time as his people do their part (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxNzY2MF0seyIxODE2MSI6M31d\">Isaiah 1:5; 27:9-11<\/a>). <\/p> ",
