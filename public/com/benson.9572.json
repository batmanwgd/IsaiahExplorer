And here God swears by that very hand which used to be held up at the taking of an oath; that is, he swears by his power and might, as it follows, that the enemies of his people should not interrupt that peace and plenty which he should give them, but that they should quietly enjoy his blessings with hearts full of thankfulness for them. This must relate to some happier condition than the Jews enjoyed after their return from captivity, when their enemies frequently invaded them, and, at last, the Romans destroyed both their temple and nation.\u201d\u2014Lowth. The passage is undoubtedly metaphorical; and is to be understood of the free and undisturbed enjoyment of the spiritual blessings of religion, which God will grant the Christian Church in the latter days: and \u201cthe oath which ushers in this promise proves that it will be exactly and punctually performed.\u201d See <a class=\"ref\">Joel 2:24<\/a>; and <a class=\"ref\">Joel 3:18; Jeremiah 31:12; Zechariah 9:17<\/a>. The expressions in the next verse, particularly in the latter part of it, allude to the ordinances of the law, which required the people to spend their first-fruits, and other hallowed things, at the temple, in a thankful acknowledgment to God for his blessings, <a class=\"ref\">Deuteronomy 12:11<\/a>; and <a class=\"ref\">Deuteronomy 14:23; Deuteronomy 14:26<\/a>. <\/p> ",
