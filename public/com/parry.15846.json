In 58:5, the Lord rebukes such attitudes, saying he has not commanded a fast wherein a person would \"afflict his soul.\"<\/p> <p><i>ye find pleasure\/exact all your labors. <\/i>Here the prophet explains why the people's fasting and prayers for deliverance went unheard. They were not sincere in their devotion, they turned to their own pleasures \"in the day of [their] fast\" instead of losing themselves in the Lord and his work, and they required others to work instead of allowing them to participate in the spirit of the fast.<\/p> <p><i>exact all your labours.<\/i> This phrase may mean \"inflict travail on others.\" Though the Israelites themselves may not have been working on their fast days, they were requiring others to work, most likely hired laborers.<\/p> ",
