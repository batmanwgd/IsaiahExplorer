We must turn from traveling on that day; from doing our pleasure on that holy day, without the control and restraint of conscience; or from indulging in the pleasures of sense. On Sabbath days we must not follow our callings, or our pleasures. In all we say and do, we must put a difference between this day and other days. Even in Old Testament times the Sabbath was called the Lord's day, and is fitly called so still; and for a further reason, it is the Lord Christ's day, <a class=\"ref\">Revelations 1:10<\/a>. If we thus remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy, we shall have the comfort and profit of it, and have reason to say, It is good to draw near to God.\n <\/p> ",
