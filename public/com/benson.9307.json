In mentioning the <i>mornings, <\/i>the prophet is thought to refer to the time of the morning sacrifice, which was the morning hour of prayer with the pious Jews; but he includes all other times of prayer, in all which he desires God to hear and answer his people, and to be their salvation all the day long, and especially to support them <i>in the time of trouble.<\/i><\/p>",
