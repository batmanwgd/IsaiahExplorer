    "html": " <p><i>Isaiah, through revelation, composed a song for us to sing in \"the land of Judah.\" The words of the song are about the city of Jerusalem, described as a \"strong city\" that is protected by God himself. Unlike the cities of the biblical world, Zion will not have regular walls that surround and protect it, because God himself will be her protection (26:1-6).<\/i><\/p> <p><i> <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODEzOCI6MTJ9\">Isa. 26:7-18<\/a> is a prayer about the way the Lord sends judgments upon the wicked. The prayer is perhaps uttered by Israel, our ancestors, or ourselves in the near future. The Lord responds to this prayer in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODE1MCI6M30=\">Isa. 26:19-21<\/a>, promising the righteous that they will be safe during the destruction of the wicked and gives a promise of the resurrection. These words bring us great comfort in a world with so many negative occurrences and influences in our lives and in our communities.<\/i><\/p> ",
