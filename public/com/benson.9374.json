When men\u2019s provocations come to a great height, God is represented in Scripture as if his patience were quite tired out, and he could no longer forbear punishing them: see <a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 15:6; Jeremiah 44:22<\/a>. <i>I will make waste mountains and hills<\/i>\u2014He does not mean dry and barren ones, for these were waste already, but such as were clothed with grass and herbs. Which clause is to be understood metaphorically of God\u2019s destroying his most lofty and flourishing enemies, often compared in Scripture to mountains and hills. <i>I will dry up the pools<\/i>\u2014Remove all the sources of their prosperity and comfort. \u201cAs God\u2019s mercy is represented by<i>pouring water upon the dry ground,<\/i> chap. 35:6, and 44:3, so his wrath is described as if it were<i>a consuming fire,<\/i> parching up every thing, and reducing it to barrenness.<\/p> ",
