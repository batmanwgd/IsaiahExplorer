Symbolically, sackcloth represented repentance, mourning, or humility (<a class=\"ref\">Ps. 35:13; Matt. 11:21<\/a>). That Isaiah had to be told to remove his sackcloth perhaps indicates that he was not permitted to mourn the forthcoming disaster that would befall Ethiopia and Egypt.<\/p> <p><i>he did so.<\/i> This was not a parable; it was an actual prophecy that was acted out by the prophet in view of his contemporaries, including perhaps his family, friends, and neighbors.<\/p> <p><i>naked and barefoot.<\/i> This phrase, mentioned three times in the section, emphasizes the Lord's command to Isaiah to remove his clothing. It is probable that Isaiah removed only his upper garment, which would have made only the upper portion of his body bare. <\/p> <p>The Assyrians forced their captives to march naked and barefoot to humiliate them, and the <i>naked and barefoot<\/i> Isaiah prophesied of the time when Egypt and Ethiopia, as Assyria's captives, would be forced to walk naked.<\/p> <p> In a spiritual sense, <i>naked<\/i> <i>and<\/i> <i>barefoot<\/i> represents the way we stand without the Atonement, \"uncovered\" before the Lord, for the Hebrew term for atonement (<i>kapar<\/i>) signifies a covering. <\/p> ",
