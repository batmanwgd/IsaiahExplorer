    "html": " <p>,(14) They shall fly upon the shoulders of the Philistines . . .\u2014The English version is ambiguous, and half suggests the thought that the Philistines should bear the returning Israelites as on their shoulders; so the LXX. gives, \u201cAnd they shall speed their wings in the ships of the aliens.\u201d What is meant, however, is that the returning exiles shall swoop down, as a bird of prey after its flight, \u201cupon the shoulder of the Philistines,\u201d that name being applied (as in <a class=\"ref\">Ezekiel 25:9; Joshua 15:10<\/a>) to the shape of the seaward- sloping country occupied by that people. From this victorious onset in the West, they are to pass on to \u201cthe children of the East,\u201d the generic name for the nomadic tribes that are found associated with the Midianites and Amalekites (<a class=\"ref\">Judges 6:3; Judges 6:33; Judges 7:12<\/a>), and in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NjkyXQ==\">Isaiah 2:6<\/a>, with the Philistines themselves, and then to complete their triumph by avenging themselves on their old enemies of Edom, and Moab, and Ammon. The whole verse is singularly characteristic of what has been already spoken of as the limitation of prophetic knowledge. The seer has had revealed to him the glory of the Messianic kingdom as a restored Eden, full of the knowledge of Jehovah, the Gentiles seeking light and salvation from it. Suddenly he blends this with anticipations that belong to the feelings and complications of his own time. He sees Philistines, Moabites, Ammonites, in that far future. They will be then, as they were in his own times, the persistent foes of Israel (comp. <a class=\"ref\">Zephaniah 2:7-9<\/a>), but will be, at last, subdued. <\/p>",
