<p>\u2003and the earth is my footstool.<\/p>         <p>Where is the house you will build for me?<\/p>         <p>\u2003Where will my resting place be?<\/p>         <p>Has not my hand made all these things,<\/p>         <p>\u2003and so they came into being?\u201d<\/p>         <p>declares the L<small>ORD<\/small>.<\/p>         <p>\u201cThis is the one I esteem:<\/p>         <p>\u2003he who is humble and contrite in spirit,<\/p>         <p>\u2003and trembles at my word.<\/p>         <p>But whoever sacrifices a bull<\/p>         <p>\u2003is like one who kills a man,<\/p>         <p>and whoever offers a lamb,<\/p>         <p>\u2003like one who breaks a dog\u2019s neck;<\/p>         <p>\u2003whoever makes a grain offering<\/p>         <p>\u2003is like one who presents pig\u2019s blood,<\/p>         <p>and whoever burns memorial incense,<\/p>         <p>\u2003like one who worships an idol.<\/p>         <p>They have chosen their own ways,<\/p>         <p>\u2003and their souls delight in their abominations;<\/p>         <p>so I also will choose harsh treatment for them<\/p>         <p>\u2003and will bring upon them what they dread.<\/p>         <p>For when I called, no one answered,<\/p>         <p>\u2003when I spoke, no one listened.<\/p>         <p>They did evil in my sight<\/p>         <p>\u2003and chose what displeases me.\u201d<\/p>         <p>Hear the word of the L<small>ORD<\/small>,<\/p>         <p>\u2003you who tremble at his word:<\/p>         <p>\u201cYour brothers who hate you,<\/p>         <p>\u2003and exclude you because of my name, have said,<\/p>         <p>Let the L<small>ORD<\/small> be glorified,<\/p>         <p>\u2003that we may see your joy!\u2019<\/p>         <p>\u2003Yet they will be put to shame.<\/p>         <p> Hear that uproar from the

<p>\u201cBefore she goes into labor,<\/p>         <p>\u2003she gives birth;<\/p>         <p>before the pains come upon her,<\/p>         <p>\u2003she delivers a son.<\/p>         <p>Who has ever heard of such a thing?<\/p>         <p>\u2003Who has ever seen such things?<\/p>         <p>Can a country be born in a day<\/p>         <p>\u2003or a nation be brought forth in a moment?<\/p>         <p>Yet no sooner is Zion in labor<\/p>         <p>\u2003than she gives birth to her children.<\/p>         <p>Do I bring to the moment of birth<\/p>         <p>\u2003and not give delivery?\u201d says the L<small>ORD<\/small>.<\/p>         <p>\u201cDo I close up the womb<\/p>         <p>\u2003when I bring to delivery?\u201d says your God.<\/p>         <p> \u201cRejoice with Jerusalem and be glad for

      <p>\u2003at her comforting breasts;<\/p>         <p>you will drink deeply<\/p>         <p>\u2003and delight in her overflowing abundance.\u201d<\/p>         <p>For this is what the L<small>ORD<\/small> says:<\/p>         <p>\u201cI will extend peace to her like a river,<\/p>         <p>\u2003and the wealth of nations like a flooding stream;<\/p>         <p>you will nurse and be carried on her arm<\/p>         <p>\u2003and dandled on her knees.<\/p>         <p> As a mother comforts her child,<\/p>         <p>\u2003so will I comfort you;<\/p>         <p>\u2003and you will be comforted over Jerusalem.\u201d<\/p>         <p>When you see this, your heart will rejoice<\/p>         <p>and you will flourish like grass;<\/p>         <p>the hand of the <small>LORD<\/small> will be made known to his servants,<\/p>         <p>\u2003but his fury will be shown to his foes.<\/p>         <p> See, the <small>LORD<\/small> is coming with fire,<\/p>         <p>\u2003and his chariots are like a whirlwind;<\/p>         <p>he will bring down his anger with fury,<\/p>         <p>\u2003and his rebuke with flames of fire.<\/p>         <p> For with fire and with his sword<\/p>         <p>\u2003the L<small>ORD<\/small> will execute judgment upon all men,<\/p>         <p>\u2003and many will be those slain by the L<small>ORD<\/small>.<\/p>         <p>\u2003\u201cThose who consecrate and purify themselves to go into the gardens, following the one in the midst of those who eat the flesh of pigs and rats and other abominable things\u2014they will meet their end together,\u201d declares the L<small>ORD<\/small>.<\/p>         <p>\u2003\u201cAnd I, because of their actions and their imaginations, am about to come and gather all nations and tongues, and they will come and see my glory.<\/p>         <p>\u2003\u201cI will set a sign among them, and I will send some of those who survive to the nations\u2014to Tarshish, to the Libyans and Lydians (famous as archers), to Tubal and Greece, and to the distant islands that have not heard of my fame or seen my glory. They will proclaim my glory among the nations. And they will bring all your brothers, from all the nations, to my holy mountain in Jerusalem as an offering to the LORD\u2014on horses, in chariots and wagons, and on mules and camels,\u201d says the L<small>ORD<\/small>. \u201cThey will bring them, as the Israelites bring their grain offerings, to the temple of the L<small>ORD<\/small> in ceremonially clean vessels. And I will select some of them also to be priests and Levites,\u201d says the L<small>ORD<\/small>.<\/p>         <p>\u201cAs the new heavens and the new earth that I make will endure before me,\u201d declares the L<small>ORD<\/small>, \u201cso will your name and descendants endure. From one New Moon to another and from one Sabbath to another, all mankind will come and bow down before me,\u201d says the L<small>ORD<\/small>. \u201cAnd they will go out and look upon the dead bodies of those who rebelled against me; their worm will not die, nor will their fire be quenched, and they will be loathsome to all mankind.\u201d<\/p>     <\/blockquote>     <h4>Original Meaning<\/h4>     <p>T<small>HERE HAS BEEN<\/small> considerable disagreement among commentators concerning the structure of this <em>Meaning<\/em> final chapter of Isaiah. In large measure this disagreement has resulted from uncertainty about the place and function of 66:5\u20136 and 15\u201316. Some scholars have taken them with the units preceding them, while others have taken them with what follows, while still others have treated them independently. Recently, however, a minor consensus has emerged (though not always as a result of the same reasoning) that the units should be seen as verses 1\u20136, 7\u201314, and 15\u201324.<\/p>     ",
