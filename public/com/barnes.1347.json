The idea here is, that the case in reference to which they sought aid was one in which &ldquo;divine&rdquo; help was indispensable, and that, therefore, they relied on the aid of the Egyptians in vain.<\/p><p><em>And their horses flesh, and not spirit<\/em> &mdash;There is need, not merely of &ldquo;physical&rdquo; strength, but of wisdom, and intelligence, and it is in vain to look for that in mere brutes.<\/p><p><em>Both he that helpeth<\/em> &mdash;Egypt, whose aid is sought.<\/p><p><em>And he that is holpen<\/em> &mdash;Judah, that had sought the aid of Egypt. Neither of them would be able to stand against the wrath of God.<\/p> ",
