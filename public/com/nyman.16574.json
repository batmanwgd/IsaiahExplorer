The fact that verses 4 and 5 refer to Israel's bondage in Egypt and their unjust oppression by the Assyrians, and did not apply specifically to the Nephites, is probably a reason for their exclusion. The Anchor Bible (20:121) translates the last phrase of verse 4 as follows: \"... and then Assyria oppressed them violently.\" This follows the Septuagint reading and is more consistent with history, as Assyria was an instrument in the Lord's hand to humble Israel. On the other hand, the KJV reading could mean that Assyria did not acknowledge the \"cause\" of their actions because they failed to respond to the Lord or recognize his hand in the conquest of Israel (see <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzg2MyI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 10:12-13<\/a>). Because the Lord's name was blasphemed during these historical occurrences, he will cause his people to know his name-and to know that he does give revelation. This is confirmed in <a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 113:10<\/a> and is a fitting introduction to verses 7 through 12, which show how in the last days the Lord will establish the knowledge that he exists. Paul applied verse 5 to the Roman Saints who were blaspheming the name of God (see <a class=\"ref\">Rom. 2:24<\/a>). It was an appropriate application which is true of every time period and should be a lesson to Church members today.<\/p>     ",
