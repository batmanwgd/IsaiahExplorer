He is, indeed, wrapt, as it were, into an ecstasy, upon considering the land as belonging to Immanuel, and foreseeing the future interposition of God for its protection. <i>Gird yourselves<\/i>\u2014With armour: prepare for war;<i>and ye shall be broken<\/i><i>in pieces<\/i>\u2014He repeats it again for the greater assurance of the thing, and the comfort of God\u2019s people. <i>Take counsel together<\/i>\u2014Against the Lord, and against his anointed, <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 2:2<\/a>;<i>and it shall come to naught<\/i>\u2014All your counsels shall be defeated, and your designs rendered abortive. <i>Speak the word<\/i>\u2014Not only fix, but declare your purpose, and make your boast of it;<i>and it shall not stand<\/i>\u2014Still you shall fail of accomplishing what you so ardently desire;<i>for God is with us<\/i>\u2014The Almighty and only true God fighteth for us and against you. This address of the prophet, to the confederate nations, is most elegant and spirited; and the foundation of his confidence is finely expressed in this last clause, in which he himself interprets the name Immanuel before given to the Messiah.<\/p> ",
