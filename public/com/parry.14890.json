    "title": "Judgment on Babylon: The Wicked Are Punished at the Second Coming",
    "html": " <p>The Medes identified in 13:17 indicate that this prophecy of Isaiah (13:11-22) was fulfilled when the Medes, under the leadership of \"Darius the Median\" (<a class=\"ref\">Dan. 5:31<\/a>) and in alliance with the Persians led by Cyrus (<a class=\"ref\">Dan. 6:28<\/a>), destroyed Babylon in approximately 539 b.c. The destruction of ancient Babylon served as a shadow of what will happen to the sinful inhabitants of the world during the judgments in the last days, for Babylon is a symbol of the world (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 1:16<\/a>). The wicked will flee destructions with fear, only to find destruction in their own country; their young men and women and children will suffer terrible deaths at the hands of others; and their homes and palaces will be made desolate, inhabited by frightful creatures\u2014all within a short period of time.<\/p> <blockquote> And I will punish the <i>world<\/i> for <u>evil<\/u>,     <br>and the <i>wicked<\/i> for their <u>iniquity<\/u>;     <br>I will cause the <i>arrogancy<\/i> of the <u>proud<\/u> to cease,     <br>and will lay down the <i>haughtiness<\/i> of the <u>terrible<\/u>. (13:11)     <br>I will make a <i>man<\/i> more precious than <u>fine gold<\/u>;     <br>even a <i>man<\/i> than the <u>golden wedge of Ophir<\/u>. (13:12)     <br>Therefore, I will <i>shake<\/i> the <u>heavens<\/u>,     <br>and the <u>earth<\/u> shall <i>remove<\/i> out of her place,     <br>in the <i>wrath<\/i> of the <u>Lord of Hosts<\/u>,     <br>and in the day of <u>his<\/u> fierce <i>anger.<\/i> (13:13)     <br>And [he] shall be as the [hunted <i>deer<\/i>]<i>, <\/i>     <br><i>and as a sheep<\/i> that no man taketh up;     <br>and they shall <i>every man<\/i> turn to <u>his own people<\/u>,     <br>and flee <i>every one<\/i> into <u>his own land<\/u>. (13:14)     <br><i>Every one<\/i> that [is proud] shall be<u> thrust through<\/u>;     <br>yea, and <i>every one<\/i> that is joined [to the wicked] shall <u>fall by the sword<\/u>. (13:15)     <br><i>Their children<\/i> also shall be <u>dashed to pieces<\/u> before their eyes;     <br><i>their houses<\/i> shall be <u>spoiled<\/u> and their <i>wives<\/i> <u>ravished<\/u>. (13:16)     <br>Behold, I will stir up the Medes against them,     <br>which shall not regard silver and gold,     <br>nor shall they delight in it. (13:17)     <br><i>Their bows shall also dash<\/i> the <u>young men<\/u> to pieces,     <br>and <i>they shall have no pity<\/i> on the <u>fruit of the womb<\/u>;     <br><i>their eyes shall not spare<\/i> <u>children<\/u>. (13:18)     <br>And Babylon, the <i>glory<\/i> of <u>kingdoms<\/u>,     <br>the <i>beauty<\/i> of the <u>Chaldees' excellency<\/u>,     <br>shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah. (13:19)     <br><i>It shall<\/i> never <u>be inhabited<\/u>,     <br>neither <i>shall it<\/i> <u>be dwelt in<\/u> from generation to generation:     <br>neither shall the <i>Arabian<\/i> <u>pitch tent there<\/u>;     <br>neither shall the <i>shepherds<\/i> <u>make their fold there<\/u>. (13:20)     <br>But <i>wild beasts<\/i> of the desert <u>shall lie there<\/u>;     <br>and their <u>houses shall be full of<\/u> <i>doleful creatures;<\/i>     <br>and <i>owls<\/i> shall <u>dwell there<\/u>,     <br>and <i>[he-goats] shall <u>dance there<\/u>. (13:21)<\/i>     <br><i>And the wild beasts<\/i> of the islands shall cry in <u>their desolate houses<\/u>,     <br>and <i>[jackals] in <u>their pleasant palaces<\/u>;<\/i>     <br><i>and her time<\/i> is <u>near to come<\/u>,     <br>and <i>her [day] shall <u>not be prolonged<\/u>.<\/i>     <br><i>[For I will destroy her speedily;<\/i>     <br><i>yea, for I will be merciful unto my people, but the wicked shall perish].
