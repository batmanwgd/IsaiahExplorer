The Septuagint read <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05db\u05d1\u05db\u05d9 <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">,kibeki <\/span>,, as with weeping, which I follow. <\/p>,\n\n <p> <em>For thy summer fruits and for thy harvest is fallen \"And upon thy vintage the destroyer hath fallen\"\u2014 <\/em> <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05e0\u05e4\u05dc \u05d4\u05d9\u05d3\u05d3 \u05e7\u05e6\u05d9\u05e8\u05da \u05d5\u05e2\u05dc <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">,veal ketsirech heidad naphal <\/span>,. In these few words there are two great mistakes, which the text of <a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 48:32 <\/a>; rectifies. For <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05e7\u05e6\u05d9\u05e8\u05da <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">,ketsirech <\/span>,, it has <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d1\u05e6\u05d9\u05e8\u05da <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">,betsirech <\/span>,; and for <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d4\u05d9\u05d3\u05d3 <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">,heidad <\/span>,, <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05e9\u05d3\u05d3 <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">,shoded <\/span>,; both which corrections the Chaldee in this place confirms. As to the first, <\/p>,\n\n <p>\"Hesebon and Eleale, and <\/p>,\n\n <p>The flowery dale of Sibmah, clad with vines,\" <\/p>,\n\n <p>were never celebrated for their harvests; it was the vintage that suffered by the irruption of the enemy; and so read the Septuagint and Syriac. <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d4\u05d9\u05d3\u05d3 <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">,heidad <\/span>,is the noisy acclamation of the treaders of the grapes. And see what sense this makes in the literal rendering of the Vulgate: <i>super messem tuam vox calcantium irruit <\/i>,, \"upon thy harvest the voice of the treaders rushes.\" The reading in <a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 48:32 <\/a>; is certainly right, <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05e0\u05e4\u05dc \u05e9\u05d3\u05d3 <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">,shoded naphal <\/span>,, \"the destroyer hath fallen.\" The shout of the treaders does not come in till the next verse; in which the text of Isaiah in its turn mends that of <a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 48:33 <\/a>,, where instead of the first <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d4\u05d9\u05d3\u05d3 <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">,heidad <\/span>,, \"the shout,\" we ought undoubtedly to read, as here, <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d4\u05d3\u05e8\u05da <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">,haddorech <\/span>,, \"the treader.\" <\/p>,",
