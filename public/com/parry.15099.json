    "html": " <p> Isaiah teaches us of the great apostasy, when earth's inhabitants made three major errors: they \"transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance, [and broke] the everlasting covenant\" (24:5). Because of this great apostasy from God's truth and his plan of happiness, God has wasted, turned upside down, emptied, and utterly spoiled the earth. Furthermore, the earth mourns, fades away, languishes, is defiled, and a curse devours it (24:1-6); because of the apostasy, God has scattered and burned the earth's inhabitants so that the few who remain do not experience happiness\u2014\"all joy is darkened\" (24:11).<\/p> <p> Although this prophecy of Isaiah speaks of many apostasies that have occurred during the history of the earth, it speaks especially of the period preceding the restoration of the gospel\u2014an apostasy that continues to this day among most of the world's people. In a revelation to the Prophet Joseph Smith, the Lord quoted <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTAxXQ==\">Isa. 24:5<\/a>: \"For they have strayed from mine ordinances, and have broken mine everlasting covenant.\" The Lord then explained, \"They seek not the Lord to establish his righteousness, but every man walketh in his own way, and after the image of his own god.\" Because of these things, and \"knowing the calamity which should come upon the inhabitants of the earth,\" the Lord \"called upon&hellip;Joseph Smith, Jun., and spake unto him from heaven, and gave him commandments\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 1:15-17<\/a>). The calamity to which the Lord refers comprises the second half of this section. The great cause of the destruction preceding the Second Coming is the wickedness that grows from apostasy.<\/p> <blockquote> Behold, the Lord <i>maketh the earth empty,<\/i>     <br>and <i>maketh it waste,<\/i>     <br>and <i>turneth it upside down<\/i>     <br>and <i>scattereth abroad the inhabitants<\/i> thereof. (24:1)     <br>And it shall be, <i>as with the people,<\/i> <u>so with the priest<\/u>;     <br><i>as with the servant,<\/i> <u>so with his master<\/u>;     <br><i>as with the maid,<\/i> <u>so with her mistress<\/u>;     <br><i>as with the buyer,<\/i> <u>so with the seller<\/u>;     <br><i>as with the lender,<\/i> <u>so with the borrower<\/u>;     <br><i>as with the [creditor],<\/i> <u>so with the [debtor<\/u>]. (24:2)     <br>The land shall be [<i>completely laid waste<\/i>],     <br>and [<i>completely plundered<\/i>]:     <br>for the Lord hath spoken this word. (24:3)     <br>The <i>earth mourneth<\/i> and [<u>withereth] away<\/u>,     <br><i>the world languisheth and [<u>withereth] away<\/u>,<\/i>     <br><i>the haughty people<\/i> of the earth do <u>languish<\/u>. (24:4)     <br>The earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof;     <br>because they have <i>transgressed<\/i> the <u>laws<\/u>,     <br><i>changed<\/i> the <u>ordinance<\/u>,     <br><i>broken<\/i> the <u>everlasting covenant<\/u>. (24:5)     <br>Therefore hath the <i>curse devoured<\/i> the <u>earth<\/u>,     <br>and <u>they that dwell therein<\/u> are [<i>held guilty<\/i>]:     <br>therefore <u>the inhabitants of the earth<\/u> are <i>burned,<\/i>     <br>and <u>few men<\/u> left; (24:6)     <br>The <i>new wine<\/i> <u>mourneth<\/u>,     <br>the <i>vine<\/i> <u>languisheth<\/u>,     <br><i>all the merryhearted<\/i> <u>do sigh<\/u>. (24:7)     <br><i>The mirth of [timbrel] <u>ceaseth<\/u>,<\/i>     <br><i>the noise of them that rejoice<\/i> <u>endeth<\/u>,     <br><i>the joy of the harp<\/i> <u>ceaseth<\/u>. (24:8)     <br>They shall <u>not<\/u> <i>drink wine<\/i> <u>with a song<\/u>;     <br><i>strong drink<\/i> <u>shall be bitter<\/u> to them that drink it. (24:9)     <br>The <i>city of confusion<\/i> is <u>broken down:<\/u>     <br><i>every house<\/i> is <u>shut up<\/u>, that <i>no man<\/i> may <u>come in<\/u>. (24:10)     <br>There is a <i>crying for wine in the streets;<\/i>     <br>all joy is darkened,     <br>the <i>mirth of the land is [removed]. (24:11)<\/i>     <br><i>In the city,<\/i> <u>desolation<\/u> [remains],     <br>and <i>the gate<\/i> is [crushed to <u>ruins<\/u>]. (24:12)<\/blockquote> ",
