The earth will be restored to the condition in which it existed before Adam's transgression (see Joseph Fielding Smith, ST, pp. 36-37; DS, 3:94).<\/p>     <p>Elder Orson Pratt interpreted the last half of this verse as a reference to the people living during the Millennium:<\/p>     <blockquote>Now, that has reference to the creation that will be renewed, at the beginning of the millennium. People will not remember. Our children that will be born during the millennium will not remember all the wickedness and corruption that existed in the days of their fathers. It will not come into their minds, unless God puts it there; but when they become immortal, after the thousand years have ended, then I think they will comprehend the process by which this world was made. (JD, 21:327.)<\/blockquote>     <p>The earth will be renewed by a pouring out of the glory of the Lord upon the earth which will cause the corrupted men and animals to be consumed, the elements of the earth to melt, and all things to become new (see <a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 101:23-25; 3 Ne. 26:3<\/a>). Peter taught that these things would occur in fulfillment of a promise of the Lord (see <a class=\"ref\">2 Pet. 3:10-13<\/a>).<\/p>     ",
