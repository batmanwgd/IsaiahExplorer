(NJV)<\/p> <\/blockquote><p>To fulfill his purposes, the Lord will bring forth a servant who will foretell the future, fulfill the Lord's word, wield power over Babylon, and ultimately succeed in his foreordained mission. Although Isaiah or Cyrus could possibly fit the description of this servant, the Lord Jesus Christ best exemplifies these qualities. It seems strange that the Lord Jehovah, who is delivering this message through Isaiah, would speak of himself in the third person as \"he\" and \"him.\" Yet the Lord might be a spokesman for God the Father in delivering the Father's promise about Jesus Christ. Thus Jesus could deliver a prophecy about himself and still use the third person. Identifying the servant as Jesus Christ enriches the interpretation of these verses. The Lord, Jehovah, asks assembled Israel to recognize him as Heavenly Father's servant and to believe that through him all things will be fulfilled.<\/p>",
