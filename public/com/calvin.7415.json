    "html": "<p><i> For Jehovah is our judge.<\/i> The Prophet now explains the manner in which God dwells in the Church. It is, that he is there worshipped and acknowledged as<i> Judege, Lawgiver,<\/i> and<i> King;<\/i> for they who obey God and yield subjection to him as their King, shall know by experience that he is the guardian of their salvation; but they who falsely glory in his name, vainly hope that he will assist them. Let us only yield to his authority, hear his voice, and obey him; and, on the other hand, he will shew that he is our protector and most faithful guardian. But when we despise his voice and disobey his word, we undoubtedly have no reason to wonder that he abandons and forsakes us in dangers.<\/p> \n<p>Hence, also, we ought to observe what is the true Church of God. It is that which acknowledges God to be a \u201cLawgiver\u201d and \u201cKing.\u201d With what effrontery, therefore, do the Papists dare to boast that they are the Church of God, seeing that they reject that lawful government of it which was enjoined by Moses, and the Prophets, and Christ, and substitute in the room of it inventions and base traffic? They exert a cruel tyranny over consciences, and, by taking away all the liberty which Christ has bestowed on us, they wretchedly harass souls and lead them to perdition; but God alone has the right to rule the conscience, because he alone is \u201cLawgiver\u201d and \u201cJudge,\u201d and he alone ought to rule and guide us by his word. He combines here the three words, \u201cJudge,\u201d \u201cLawgiver\u201d and King,\u201d because the subject is of very great importance, and ought not to be lightly set aside. If, therefore, we permit ourselves to be guided by his word, he will never fail us; and this is the only way of obtaining salvation.<\/p> ",
