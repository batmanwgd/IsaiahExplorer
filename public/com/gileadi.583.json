    "html": "<p>Jehovah&rsquo;s servant receives opposition from the rebellious who feel threatened by his preaching things &ldquo;not told them&rdquo; or that &ldquo;they had not heard&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 52:15<\/a>; cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODYyMSI6M30=\">48:6-8<\/a>). The servant&rsquo;s instruction of Jehovah&rsquo;s people (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODY2NywxODE3NF0seyIxODYzMCI6M31d\">v 4; Isaiah 28:9; 48:15-17<\/a>) in the knowledge of God (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 11:2; 53:11<\/a>) undermines the knowledge of their learned men and sages (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 29:14; 44:25<\/a>). Part V of Isaiah&rsquo;s Seven-Part Structure (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODYxNiI6MTI2fQ==\">Isaiah 24-27; 48-54<\/a>) identifies the servant&rsquo;s ill treatment and disfigurement (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 49:7; 52:14<\/a>) as an integral part of his descent into trials before his ascent to rebirth and re-creation.<\/p><p>The servant&rsquo;s &ldquo;knowing&rdquo; he won&rsquo;t be disgraced or confounded stems from his knowing the terms of the Davidic Covenant under which he serves as a proxy savior to Jehovah&rsquo;s people (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 33:6; 38:19; 53:11<\/a>). He may incur suffering and humiliation in the course of paying the price of his people&rsquo;s temporal salvation, yet such afflictions are but for a small moment. After the trial of his faith comes the blessing, at which point Jehovah empowers him over his enemies (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 49:5-8; 52:13-15; 55:3-5<\/a>). In the end, it is his enemies who are disgraced and confounded (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 45:24; 65:13-15; 66:5-6<\/a>).<\/p>",
