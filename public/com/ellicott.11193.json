    "html": "<p>The defenced city shall be desolate . . .\u2014The key to this prediction is found in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTIxXQ==\">Isaiah 25:2<\/a>, where the same words occur. The \u201cdefenced city\u201d is that of the strangers, who are the enemies of God\u2019s people, and its destruction is contrasted with the restoration of the purified Jerusalem of the preceding verse. To see in the \u201cdefenced city\u201d which is to be laid low Jerusalem itself is at variance with the natural sequence of thought. The picture of desolation\u2014calves feeding in what had been the busy streets of a populous city\u2014is analogous to that of the \u201cwild beasts of the desert,\u201d roaring among the ruins of Babylon, in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzkyOCI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 13:21-22<\/a>. <\/p>",
