    "html": "<p> The address to the whole of the coast-land now passes into an address to the ancestral city. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MDgyXQ==\">Isaiah 23:4<\/a> <em> \u201cShudder, O Sidon; for the sea speaketh, the fortress of the sea, thus: I have not travailed, nor given birth, nor trained up young men, brought up maidens.\u201d<\/em> The sea, or more closely considered, the fortress of the sea, i.e., the rock-island on which Neo-tyrus stood with its strong and lofty houses, lifts up its voice in lamentation. Sidon, the ancestress of Canaan, must hear with overwhelming shame how Tyre mourns the loss of her daughters, and complains that, robbed as she has been of her children, she is like a barren women. For the war to have murdered her young men and maidens, was exactly the same as if she had never given birth to them or brought them up. Who is there that does not recognise in this the language of Isaiah (compare <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NjU3XQ==\">Isaiah 1:2<\/a>)? - Even in Egypt the fate of Phoenicia produces alarm. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MDgzXQ==\">Isaiah 23:5<\/a> <em> \u201cWhen the report cometh to Egypt, they tremble at the report from Tzor.\u201d<\/em> In the protasis ( ) <em> l e mitzraim <\/em> (to Egypt) the verb \u201ccometh\u201d is implied; the <em> Caph<\/em> in  signifies simultaneousness, as in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MDAyXQ==\">Isaiah 18:4<\/a> and <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MjM3XQ==\">Isaiah 30:19<\/a> (Ges. <em> Thes<\/em> . p. 650). The news of the fall of Tyre spreads universal terror in Egypt, because its own prosperity depended upon Tyre, which was the great market for its corn; and when such a bulwark had fallen, a similar fate awaited itself.<\/p>",
