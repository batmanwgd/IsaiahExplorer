This also has an individual application: As we fast, we seek to become like the Bright and Morning Star (<a class=\"ref\">Rev. 22:16<\/a>), the Dayspring (<a class=\"ref\">Luke 1:78<\/a>), the Light of the World (<a class=\"ref\">John 8:12; Alma 38:9<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 11:28<\/a>), Jesus Christ.<\/p> ",
