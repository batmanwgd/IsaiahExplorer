    "html": "<p>Oppressive laws, symptomatic of a corrupt society, by their very nature lead to more corruption. People&rsquo;s thinking turns devious as they seek ways of getting around the law. In an unequal community, the poor and needy, the widows and fatherless, are the first to suffer ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3Njc4XQ==\">Isaiah 1:23<\/a>). Jehovah&rsquo;s calling those who are unable on their own to lift themselves out of poverty &ldquo;my people&rdquo; implies that he acknowledges them, not their oppressors, as his covenant people. The terms &ldquo;plunder&rdquo; and &ldquo;spoil,&rdquo; which characterize the Assyrian archtyrant ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODU3XQ==\">v 6<\/a>), show that he is the evil archetype that oppressors follow.<\/p> ",
