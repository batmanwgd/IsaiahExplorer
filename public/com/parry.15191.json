    "html": " <p> Isaiah now turns his attention from the inhabitants of the Northern Kingdom to those of the Southern Kingdom. Because the people of Judah refused to trust in the Lord and instead entered into a \"covenant with<i> <\/i>death\" (28:15; 31:1-3), the Lord decreed an overflowing scourge (28:18). This scourge symbolizes a greater scourge that will cover the entire earth before Jesus' second coming. To prepare a righteous remnant for this terrible event, the Lord established a precious cornerstone (Jesus Christ) as the beginning of the foundation of Zion. Those who build upon the cornerstone will find safety.<\/p> <blockquote> Wherefore hear the word of the Lord,     <br>ye scornful men, that rule this people which is in Jerusalem. (28:14)     <br>Because ye have said, <i>We have made a covenant<\/i> <u>with death<\/u>,     <br>and <u>with hell<\/u> are <i>we at agreement;<\/i>     <br>when the overflowing scourge shall pass through,     <br>it shall not come unto us:     <br>for we have made <i>lies<\/i> <u>our refuge<\/u>,     <br>and under <i>falsehood<\/i> have <u>we hid ourselves<\/u>: (28:15)     <br>Therefore thus saith the Lord God,     <br>Behold, I lay in Zion for <i>a foundation a stone,<\/i> <u>a tried stone<\/u><i>,<\/i>     <br><u>a precious corner stone<\/u>, <i>a sure foundation:<\/i>     <br>he that believeth shall not make haste. (28:16)     <br><i>Judgment <\/i>also will I lay to the<u> line<\/u>,     <br>and <i>righteousness<\/i> to the <u>plummet<\/u>:     <br>and the <i>hail <\/i>shall <u>sweep away the refuge of lies<\/u>,     <br>and the <i>waters<\/i> shall <u>overflow the hiding place<\/u>. (28:17)     <br>And your <i>covenant with death<\/i> <u>shall be disannulled<\/u>,     <br>and your <i>agreement<\/i> <i>with hell<\/i> <u>shall not stand<\/u>;     <br>when the <i>overflowing scourge shall pass through,<\/i> then <u>ye shall be trodden down<\/u> by it. (28:18)     <br>From the time that <i>it goeth forth<\/i> <u>it shall take you<\/u>:     <br>for <i>morning by morning<\/i> shall it pass over,     <br>by <i>day and by night:<\/i>     <br>and it shall be a vexation only to understand the report. (28:19)     <br>For the <i>bed is shorter<\/i> than that a <u>man can stretch himself on it<\/u>:     <br>and the <i>covering narrower<\/i> than that <u>he can wrap himself in it<\/u>. (28:20)     <br>For the <i>Lord shall rise up<\/i> <u>as in mount Perazim<\/u>,     <br><i>he shall be wroth<\/i> <u>as in the valley of Gibeon<\/u>,     <br>that he may <i>do his work,<\/i> <u>his strange work<\/u>;     <br>and <i>bring to pass his act,<\/i> <u>his strange act<\/u>. (28:21)     <br>Now therefore be ye not mockers, lest your bands be made strong:     <br>for I have heard from the Lord God of hosts a consumption,     <br>even determined upon the whole earth.
