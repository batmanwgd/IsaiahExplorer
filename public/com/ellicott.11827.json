    "html": "<p>In all their affliction . . .\u2014Literally, there was affliction to Him. So taken, the words speak of a compassion like that of <a class=\"ref\">Judges 10:16<\/a>. The Hebrew text gives, In all their affliction there was no affliction: i.e., it was as nothing compared with the salvation which came from Jehovah. The Authorised Version follows the K\u0115ri, or marginal reading of the Hebrew. It may be inferred, from the strange rendering of both clauses in the LXX. (\u201cneither a messenger, nor an angel, but He himself saved them \u201c), that the variation in the text existed at an early date, and was a source of perplexity, and therefore of conjectural emendation. <\/p>\n <p>The angel of his presence . . .\u2014Literally, the angel of His face. As in <a class=\"ref\">Exodus 23:20-23; Exodus 32:34; Exodus 33:2<\/a>, so here, Jehovah is thought of as working out His purpose of deliverance for Israel through the mediation of an angel, who is thus described either as revealing the highest attributes of God, of which the \u201cface\u201d is the anthropomorphic symbol, or as standing ever in the immediate presence of the King of kings, ready for any mission. <\/p>\n <p>He bare them . . .\u2014The same image of fatherly care meets us in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NTkwXQ==\">Isaiah 46:3<\/a>, <a class=\"ref\">Exodus 19:4, Deuteronomy 1:31; Deuteronomy 32:11<\/a>. <\/p>",
