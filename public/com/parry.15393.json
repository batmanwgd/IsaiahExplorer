A sign was given to the people of Jerusalem to provide hope and to confirm to subsequent generations that the Lord fulfills his promises. The sign was this: Because of the Assyrian threat, the people could not farm for two years (\"this year&hellip;and the second year\"), but they would eat whatever \"groweth of itself.\" In the third and subsequent years, though, the people would be able to plow, plant, and eat the fruit of their labors.<\/p> ",
