He will pass judgment upon the \"ancients\" (elders, the primary administrators of justice) and the \"princes\" (royal appointees, rulers, or leaders). They are guilty of having \"eaten up\" (plundered, pillaged, consumed) the vineyards of the people and the Lord. They have taken the \"spoil\" (embezzled gain or plunder) of the poor into their own homes. They have beaten (crushed and mistreated) the people in general, and the poor in particular.<\/p>",
