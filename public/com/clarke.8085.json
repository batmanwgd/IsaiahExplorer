Uzziah seems to have followed the example of Solomon, see  <a class=\"ref\">1 Kings 10:26-29<\/a>, who first transgressed in these particulars; he recovered the port of Elath on the Red Sea, and with it that commerce which in Solomon's days had \"made silver and gold as plenteous at Jerusalem as stones,\"  <a class=\"ref\">2 Chronicles 1:15<\/a>. He had an army of 307,500 men, in which, as we may infer from the testimony of Isaiah, the chariots and horse made a considerable part. \"The law above mentioned was to be a standing trial of prince and people, whether they had trust and confidence in God their deliverer.\" See Bp. Sherlock's Discourses on Prophecy. Dissert. iv., where he has excellently explained the reason and effect of the law, and the influence which the observance or neglect of it had on the affairs of the Israelites.<\/p>",
