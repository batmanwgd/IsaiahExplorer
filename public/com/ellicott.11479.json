It follows from that meaning that God cannot look with indifference on the transfer to the \u201cgraven image\u201d of the worship due to Him.

The \u201cformer things\u201d refer probably not to the remote past, but to Isaiah\u2019s earlier prophecies, say the whole Assyrian cycle, on which he now looks back from his new stand-point; or even, as in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDc0XQ==\">Isaiah 41:22<\/a>, to the near future of the conquests of Cyrus as compared with that which was to usher in the restoration of Israel. <\/p>",
