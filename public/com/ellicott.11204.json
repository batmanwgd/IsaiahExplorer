They, with their short sharp commands, would be the next utterers of Jehovah\u2019s will to the people who would not listen to the prophet\u2019s teaching. The description of the \u201cstammering tongue\u201d re-appears in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4Mjk5XQ==\">Isaiah 33:19<\/a>. (Comp. <a class=\"ref\">Deuteronomy 28:49<\/a>.) In <a class=\"ref\">1 Corinthians 14:21<\/a>, the words are applied to the gift of \u201ctongues,\u201d which, in its ecstatic utterances, was unintelligible to those who heard it, and was therefore, as the speech of the barbarian conquerors was in Isaiah\u2019s thoughts, the antithesis of true prophetic teaching.<\/p>",
