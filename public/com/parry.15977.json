The Lord here uses this gesture to invite a wicked people to repent and come unto him, and he does so unceasingly. This gesture also suggests the position of Christ on the cross with his hands spread out in our behalf.<\/p> <p><i>walketh not in my ways.<\/i> The people are willful, walking in paths of wickedness rather than in the Lord's paths of righteousness.<\/p> <p><i>walk after their own thoughts.<\/i> Actions begin with thoughts. The wicked first give place to thoughts that are displeasing to the Lord, and then they let those thoughts lead them to actions of wickedness (55:8-9).<\/p> ",
