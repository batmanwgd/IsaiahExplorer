    "html": " <p>Like Babylon, Tyre represented the world and so eventually would come under the judgments of God. Like Babylon, she was seen as a harlot committing fornication (joining in wickedness) with the kingdoms of the world (see <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODA5M10seyIxODA5NSI6Mn1d\">Isaiah 23:15, 17&ndash;18 <\/a>; compare <a class=\"ref\">Revelation 17:1&ndash;2 <\/a>). The seventy years may refer to her coming judgments. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MDk2XQ==\">Isaiah 23:18 <\/a> shows that eventually the merchandise of Tyre (the world) will be put to proper use in building the kingdom of Jehovah. <\/p> <p class=\"cite\"> LDS Church Educational System Old Testament Student Manual, 1 Kings&ndash;Malachi, Religion 302, Chapter 14, Item 44 <\/p> ",
