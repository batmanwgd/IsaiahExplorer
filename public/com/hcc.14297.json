    "html": "<p><i>Death. <\/i> Hebrew, \"and he made his grave with the wicked<i>men,<\/i> and with the rich<i>man,<\/i> in his death.\" (Haydock)&mdash; Grave and death seem to be transposed; and we might better read, \"He was taken up with wicked men in his death, and with a rich man was his sepulchre.\" This indeed is only a conjecture, but well grounded in the context. See Josue xxiv. 19. (Kennicott)&mdash; Septuagint, \"and I will give the wicked for his grave, and the rich men for his death.\" (Haydock)&mdash; The<i>rich man<\/i> may denote the small number of Jews who embraced the faith. (Calmet)&mdash; They esteemed themselves rich, and were highly favoured by God; yet they were blinded, (Haydock) and given up to the Romans, in punishment of their deicide, Matthew xxvii. 25. The Church is gathered both from Jews and Gentiles, ver. 10. (Calmet) (St. Jerome)&mdash; \"He will send to hell the wicked,\" (Chaldean) who slew him. (Menochius)&mdash; Christ was buried where malefactors were generally, yet honourably, in the tomb of Joseph [of Arimathea]. (Worthington) (Matthew xxvii. 57.)<\/p> ",
