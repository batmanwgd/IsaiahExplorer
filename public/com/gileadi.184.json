    "html": " <p>As noted, Babylon&rsquo;s destruction is a worldwide event (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3OTE2LDE3ODc0XQ==\">v 9; Isaiah 10:23 <\/a>). &ldquo;The world,&rdquo; &ldquo;the wicked,&rdquo; &ldquo;insolent men,&rdquo; and &ldquo;tyrants&rdquo; add to the list of entities that comprise Isaiah&rsquo;s Greater Babylon. Jehovah puts an end to pride in that day. Whether of his own people or the nations, it is the same: &ldquo;What will you do in the day of reckoning when the holocaust overtakes you from afar?&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODU0XQ==\">Isaiah 10:3 <\/a>); &ldquo;Jehovah of Hosts has a day in store for all the proud and arrogant and for all who are exalted, that they may be brought low&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3Njk4XQ==\">Isaiah 2:12 <\/a>); &ldquo;Tyrants shall come to nought and scorners cease&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MjE0XQ==\">Isaiah 29:20 <\/a>). <\/p> ",
