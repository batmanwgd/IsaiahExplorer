The Hebrew implies rather the tone of one who gives an authoritative ultimatum, as from a judge to the accused, who had no defence, or only a sham defence, to offer (<a class=\"ref\">Micah 6:2-3 <\/a>). \u201cLet us sum up the pleadings\u2014that ultimatum is one of grace and mercy\u2014\u2018Repent, and be forgiven.\u2019\u201d <\/p> \n <p>Though your sins be as scarlet.\u2014The two colours probably corresponded to those now designated by the English words.
