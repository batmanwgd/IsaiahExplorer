The principle of foreknowledge is difficult to understand, but is affirmed by several prophets who have been shown the end of the world from the beginning (see <a class=\"ref\">1 Ne. 14:24-26<\/a>). The Lord shows the future so that false gods will not be worshipped or credited with his operations. This understanding is an important contribution by Isaiah.<\/p>     ",
