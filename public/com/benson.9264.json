Or, 2d, I will make <i>Ariel <\/i> the city like <i>Ariel <\/i> the altar, filling it with sacrifices, even of men, whom I will slay in my anger; which act of God is called his sacrifice, <a class=\"ref\">Ezekiel 39:17-19 <\/a>. Agreeably to this latter interpretation, Bishop Lowth renders the clause, <i>It shall be unto me as the hearth of the great altar: <\/i> that is, as he explains it, \u201call on flame; as it was when taken by the Chaldeans; or covered with carcasses and blood, as when taken by the Romans: an intimation of which more distant events, though not immediate subjects of the prophecy, may perhaps be given in this obscure passage.\u201d <\/p> ",
