It is put for all the enemies of the church. Bozrah\u2014The capital city of Idumea. Here is also an allusion to the garments of this conqueror, Edom signifying red, and Bozrah a vintage. Glorious\u2014Such as generals march before their armies in. Righteousness\u2014Here Christ gives an answer, wherein he both asserts his fidelity, that he will faithfully perform what he hath promised, and that he will truly execute justice. Mighty\u2014I have power to accomplish salvation.",
