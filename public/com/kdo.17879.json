    "html": "<p> The relation of Israel and Jehovah to one another is now a permanent one. <em> \u201cThou keepest the firmly-established mind in peace, peace; for his confidence rests on Thee.\u201d<\/em> A gnome (borrowed in <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 112:7-8<\/a>), but in a lyrical connection, and with a distinct reference to the church of the last days. There is no necessity to take \u05e1\u05de\u05d5\u05bc \u05d9\u05e6\u05e8 as standing for \u05d9\u05e6\u05e8 \u05e1\u05de\u05d5\u05bc \u05da , as Knobel does. The state of mind is mentioned here as designating the person possessing it, according to his inmost nature. \u05d9\u05e6\u05e8 (the mind) is the whole attitude and habit of a man as inwardly constituted, i.e., as a being capable of thought and will. \u05e1\u05de\u05d5\u05bc \u05da is the same, regarded as having a firm hold in itself, and this it has whenever it has a firm hold on God (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODcxXQ==\">Isaiah 10:20<\/a>). This is the mind of the new Israel, and Jehovah keeps it, <em> sha\u0302lom <\/em> , <em> sha\u0302lom <\/em> (peace, peace; accusative predicates, used in the place of a consequential clause), i.e., so that deep and constant peace abides therein (<a class=\"ref\">Philemon 4:7<\/a>). Such a mind is thus kept by Jehovah, because its trust is placed in Jehovah. \u05d1\u05bc\u05d8\u05d5\u05bc\u05d7 refers to \u05d9\u05e6\u05e8 , according to Ewald, \u00a7149, <em> d<\/em> , and is therefore equivalent to \u05d4\u05d5\u05bc\u05d0 \u05d1\u05bc\u05d8\u05d5\u05bc\u05d7 (cf., <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 7:10; Psalms 55:20<\/a>), the passive participle, like the Latin <em> confisus <\/em> , <em> fretus <\/em> . To hang on God, or to be thoroughly devoted to Him, secures both stability and peace.<\/p>",
