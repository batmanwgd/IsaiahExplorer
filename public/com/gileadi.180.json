His destruction of all nations, including the wicked of Jehovah&rsquo;s people, is a consistent theme in the Book of Isaiah (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc3NjUiOjZ9LFsxNzg3NCwxNzk1MiwxODE4NywxODI4MSwxODM3MSwxODY4NywxODc0MF0seyIxODgxOSI6Mn0seyIxODg3MCI6NH1d\">Isaiah 5:25-30; 10:23; 14:23; 28:22; 33:1; 37:18; 51:13; 54:16; 59:18-19; 63:3-6<\/a>).
