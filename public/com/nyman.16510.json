The Lord again identifies himself as the Savior and the messengers as his \"witnesses.\" Elder Bruce R. McConkie has identified verse 12 as a prophecy of this day: <\/p>     <blockquote>The power of God unto salvation is found here in the tops of these everlasting hills; and this glorious truth is spreading out to all the nations of the earth as rapidly as people in them accept the testimony and witness that is borne and believe the truths that our fellow representatives proclaim. This is a day of which God has said that all of gathered Israel shall be witnesses of his name. \"... ye are my witnesses, saith the Lord, that I am god.\" (CR, Apr. 1972, p. 135; see also CR, Oct. 1969, pp. 82-83; CR, Apr. 1973, p. 36.)<\/blockquote>     <p>In <a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 76<\/a> of the Doctrine and Covenants, the Lord identified himself in nearly the same words as those given in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NTE3XQ==\">Isaiah 43:11<\/a> (see <a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 76:1<\/a>).<\/p>     ",
