The \"fruits of righteousness\" (<a class=\"ref\">2 Cor. 9:10; Heb. 12:11<\/a>) come through the atonement of \"Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God\" (<a class=\"ref\">Philip. 1:11<\/a>). When Isaiah writes that the righteous will \"eat the fruit of their doings\" (3:10), this may signify that the righteous will enjoy the fruits of the Spirit, which include \"love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, [and] temperance\" (<a class=\"ref\">Gal. 5:22-23; Eph. 5:9<\/a>, <a class=\"ref\"> 11<\/a>). Evil trees, however, will bear rotten fruit, which is representative of the works of the wicked. Christ taught, \"by their fruits ye shall know them\" (<a class=\"ref\">3 Ne. 14:16-20<\/a>). <\/p> ",
