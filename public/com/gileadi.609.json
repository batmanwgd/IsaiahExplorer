    "html": "<p>Parallel statements infer that Jehovah&rsquo;s <em>arm<\/em> (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NjgzLDE4NzA3XQ==\">Isaiah 51:9; 52:10<\/a>)&mdash;his end-time servant&mdash;is &ldquo;revealed&rdquo; for the sake of those who &ldquo;believe&rdquo; the revelation concerning the person who is the subject of <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTg2ODQ=\">verses 1-10<\/a>. Believing in Jehovah&rsquo;s revelation as his servant reveals it (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MDQ2LDE4NjczLDE4NzEyXQ==\">Isaiah 21:10; 50:10; 52:15<\/a>) thus constitutes a test of one&rsquo;s faith in the God of Israel. Use of the possessive &ldquo;<em>our<\/em> revelation&rdquo; suggests that alternative versions exist that aren&rsquo;t grounded in the truth. It also implies that a division occurs between those of Jehovah&rsquo;s people who believe the revelation and those who don&rsquo;t (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTgxLDE4NTE2XQ==\">Isaiah 28:16; 43:10<\/a>).<\/p><p>While scholars lump <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODcxMCI6MTV9\">Isaiah 52:13-53:12<\/a> together as a single messianic prophecy, a distinction exists between those verses in which Jehovah speaks of his servant (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg3MTAiOjN9LHsiMTg3MjMiOjJ9XQ==\">Isaiah 52:13-15; 53:11-12<\/a>) and those in which a spokesman for Jehovah&rsquo;s people, tenably the servant, speaks of the subject of <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODcxMyI6MTB9\">Isaiah 53:1-10<\/a>. Isaiah&rsquo;s Servant-Tyrant Parallelism&mdash;a structure of twenty-one antithetical verses that contrast the king of Babylon in chapter 14 with the King of Zion in chapters 52-53&mdash;shows that the subject of <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODcxMyI6MTB9\">Isaiah 53:1-10<\/a> is none other than Jehovah, the King of Zion, and that his servant resembles him.<\/p><p>As we have seen, a close affinity exists between Jehovah and his servant. They appear as two <em>arms<\/em> of God&mdash;<em>righteousness<\/em> and <em>salvation<\/em>&mdash;that intervene among humanity to restore and deliver Jehovah&rsquo;s people (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3sic2luZ2xlcyI6WzE4MjgyLDE4Njc5LDE4NzA3LDE4ODE3XX0seyIxODQzMSI6Mn0seyIxODYyOSI6M30seyIxODY4MyI6M31d\">Isaiah 33:2; 40:10-11; 48:14-16; 51:5, 9-11; 52:10; 59:16<\/a>). Jehovah&rsquo;s empowering his <em>arm<\/em> (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTg2ODM=\">Isaiah 51:9<\/a>) thus means that with the coming of the servant events take a new turn. Word links show that divine revelation comes forth that only those weaned from milk can digest, while those who are content with a lesser portion of Jehovah&rsquo;s word are ensnared and taken captive (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODE3NCI6OH0=\">Isaiah 28:9-16<\/a>).<\/p>",
