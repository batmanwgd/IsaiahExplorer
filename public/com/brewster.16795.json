His initial, but brief, hesitancy to serve was not based on his lack of faith in God's power, but only because of his own feelings of unworthiness. Once being assured he was cleansed and worthy to serve, he stepped to the forefront. Isaiah's response reminds one of Nephi's declaration regarding a difficult assignment given him. (See <a class=\"ref\">1 Nephi 3:7<\/a>.)<\/p>",
