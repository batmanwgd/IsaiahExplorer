    "html": "<p>The Restoration was a long time in coming. During the years of waiting, dispossessed Israel undoubtedly felt lonely and forsaken by the Lord. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg2NDEiOjl9XQ==\">Isaiah 49:4&ndash;12<\/a>shows that loneliness. Verse 4 describes the attitude of one somewhat discouraged, yet not completely so: &ldquo;I have spent my strength &hellip; in vain: yet surely my judgment is with the Lord&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg2NDEiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 49:4<\/a>).<\/p><p>Nephi spoke of the Jews in their cast-off condition as being &ldquo;a hiss and a byword and &hellip; hated among all nations&rdquo; (<a class=\"ref\">1 Nephi 19:14<\/a>). <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg2NDQiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 49:7<\/a>describes that condition: men despise and abhor the Lord&rsquo;s covenant people. But Israel still has hope: &ldquo;Though Israel be not gathered, yet shall I (Israel) be glorious in the eyes of the Lord&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg2NDIiOjF9XQ==\">v. 5<\/a>). Jacob will yet be raised and restored and stand as &ldquo;a light to the Gentiles&rdquo; and as a beacon of &ldquo;salvation unto the end of the earth&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg2NDMiOjF9XQ==\">v. 6<\/a>). &ldquo;In an acceptable time&rdquo; God will hear their cry and &ldquo;give thee [&ldquo;my servant,&rdquo; in <a class=\"ref\">1 Nephi 21:8<\/a>] for a covenant of the people&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg2NDUiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 49:8<\/a>). That began with the call of Joseph Smith. Since then, the call has gone forth to others, &ldquo;to the [spiritual] prisoners, Go forth; to them that are in [spiritual] darkness, Shew yourselves&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg2NDYiOjF9XQ==\">v. 9<\/a>). They shall be fed with the fruits of the gospel&mdash;not &ldquo;hunger nor thirst&rdquo;&mdash;and shall be gathered into the gospel net &ldquo;from far &hellip; from the north and from the west&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg2NDciOjJ9XQ==\">vv. 10, 12<\/a>).<\/p><p>Nephi interpreted the foregoing verses in <a class=\"ref\">1 Nephi 22<\/a>. His brothers had asked if Isaiah&rsquo;s words were to be interpreted spiritually or temporally, and Nephi replied that they were to be interpreted both ways (see <a class=\"ref\">1 Nephi 22:1&ndash;3<\/a>). He then described Israel&rsquo;s scattering and gathering by the Gentiles. First Nephi 22:8&ndash;12 gives a very clear interpretation of <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg2MzgiOjI2fV0=\">Isaiah 49<\/a>.<\/p><p class=\"cite\">LDS Church Educational System Old Testament Student Manual, 1 Kings&ndash;Malachi, Religion 302, Chapter 17, Item 6<\/p>",
