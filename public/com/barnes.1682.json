The gods whom the Babylonians worshipped had not even power to protect the images which were made to represent them, and which had now become a heavy burden to the animals and wains which were carrying them away. They could not rescue them from the hands of the conqueror; and how unable were they, therefore, to defend those who put their trust in them. The Vulgate renders this, &lsquo;They could not deliver him that bare them.&rsquo; The Septuagint, &lsquo;You are carrying them like a burden bound on the weary, faint, and hungry; who are all without strength, and unable to escape from battle; and as for them, they are carried away captives!&rsquo;<\/p><p><em>But themselves<\/em>&mdash;Margin, as Hebrew, &lsquo;Their soul.&rsquo; The sense is, that the gods thus worshipped, so far from being able to defend those who worshipped them, had themselves become captive, and were borne to a distant land.<\/p>",
