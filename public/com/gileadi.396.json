Humanity&rsquo;s lowest spiritual categories&mdash;Perdition, Babylon, and Jacob\/Israel&mdash;cannot exist in the millennial age. The kingdom of God and its divine institutions&mdash;Zion\/Jerusalem and categories higher&mdash;alone remain: &ldquo;I will make peace your rulers and righteousness your oppressors; tyranny shall no more be heard of in your land&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 60:17-18<\/a>). Only the millennial &ldquo;lords&rdquo; and &ldquo;nobles&rdquo; of the earth&mdash;the proxy saviors of Jehovah&rsquo;s people&mdash;are summoned on solemn occasions to pay tribute to Jehovah, the King of Zion.<\/p>",
