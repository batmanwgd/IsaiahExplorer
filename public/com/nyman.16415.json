Sperry called \"one of the finest examples of Hebrew poetry in the Bible\" <i>(The Voice of Israel's Prophets<\/i> [Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1965], p. 44). While the poem contains a description of Satan as the ruler of spiritual Babylon, the message is a dual one; Satan, of course, is described under the guise of the ancient king of Babylon, Nebuchadnezzar.<\/p>     ",
