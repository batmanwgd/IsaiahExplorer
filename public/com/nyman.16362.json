Peter felt this unworthiness when he recognized the divinity of the Savior, even when the Lord was not attended by glory (see <a class=\"ref\">Luke 5:4-9<\/a>). Moses acknowledged his nothingness following his vision of the earth and its inhabitants (see <a class=\"ref\">Moses 1:9-10<\/a>). The subjects of King Benjamin fell to the earth and pleaded for the atoning blood of Christ to cleanse them from their carnal state when the king taught them of the Savior's atonement (see <a class=\"ref\">Mosiah 4:1-2<\/a>).<\/p>     ",
