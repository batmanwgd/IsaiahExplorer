Isaiah's words apply to us: We are \"sent forth&hellip;to teach the children of men the things which I have put into your hands by the power of my Spirit; and ye are to be taught from on high. Sanctify yourselves and ye shall be endowed with power\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 43:15-16; 110:9<\/a>). <\/p> <p><i>good tidings. <\/i>This is the restored gospel, which is to be preached to the entire world.<\/p> <p><i>Jerusalem&hellip;lift up thy voice. <\/i>The Lord will come in glory to Jerusalem to reign on the earth (24:23). The good news of the Lord's reign will then go forth from Jerusalem to the<i> <\/i>cities of Judah, or to all of the lands where the children of Judah dwell, to call them to come and \"Behold your God!\" In a broader sense, Jerusalem stands as a symbol for the covenant people of God.<\/p> ",
