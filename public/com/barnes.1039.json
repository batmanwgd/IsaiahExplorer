Of course many prisoners would be taken in war. Instead of giving them liberty, he threw them into prison and kept them there. This may be rendered, &lsquo;his prisoners he did not release that they might return home&rsquo; (see the Margin). The Chaldee renders it, &lsquo;To his prisoners he did not open the door.&rsquo; The sense is substantially the same. The idea is, that he was cruel and oppressive. He threw his captives into dungeons, and found pleasure in retaining them there. <\/p> ",
