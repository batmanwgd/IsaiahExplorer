    "html": " <p> <em>He is come to Aiath\u2014 <\/em>,A description of the march of Sennacherib's army approaching Jerusalem in order to invest it, and of the terror and confusion spreading and increasing through the several places as he advanced; expressed with great brevity, but finely diversified. The places here mentioned are all in the neighborhood of Jerusalem; from Ai northward, to Nob westward of it; from which last place he might probably have a prospect of Mount Sion. Anathoth was within three Roman miles of Jerusalem, according to Eusebius, Jerome and Josephus. Onomast. Loc. Hebr. et Antiq. <a href=\"\/\/www.studylight.org\/desk\/index.cgi?q1=Jud+10:7&t1=en_nas\" id=\"34\" class=\"stL\" target=\"_blank\">,Jud. 10:7 <\/a>,, <a href=\"\/\/www.studylight.org\/desk\/index.cgi?q1=Jud+10:3&t1=en_nas\" id=\"35\" class=\"stL\" target=\"_blank\">,3 <\/a>. Nob was probably still nearer. And it should seem from this passage of Isaiah that Sennacherib's army was destroyed near the latter of these places. In coming out of Egypt he might perhaps join the rest of his army at Ashdod, after the taking of that place, which happened about that time, (see <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODAzMSI6Nn0=\">Isaiah 20:1-6 <\/a>.); and march from thence near the coast by Lachish and Libnah, which lay in his way from south to north, and both which he invested till he came to the north-west of Jerusalem, crossing over to the north of it, perhaps by Joppa and Lydda; or still more north through the plain of Esdraelon. <\/p>,",
