The plea is addressed to Jehovah, on the ground of His promise that the inheritance was to be an everlasting one. Compared with that promise, the period of possession, from Joshua and David to the fall of the monarchy, was but as a \u201clittle while.\u201d (Comp. <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 90:4 <\/a>.) The seeming failure of the promise was aggravated by the fact that the enemies of Israel had trodden down the sanctuary. <\/p> ",
