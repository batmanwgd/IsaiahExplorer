Yet, as the Nephite text shows, in her heart she knows her Redeemer \"will show that he hath not.\" His memory of and feelings for her are even stronger than those of a mother for the child she has borne. The image of Israel is ever before the Lord.<\/p>     <p>Jehovah reiterates His promises that the children of Israel shall return from captivity. He swears with a divine oath (\"as I live\") that His word will be kept. Israel will be utterly amazed at her numbers and will plead for more space to hold her burgeoning population.<\/p>     <table>         <tbody>             <tr>                 <td>14 But Zion said<u>,<\/u> The Lord hath forsaken me, and my Lord hath forgotten me<u>.<\/u>                     <br>                     <br>15 <u>C<\/u>an a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? <u>y<\/u>ea, they may forget, yet will I not forget thee<u>.<\/u>                     <br>                     <br>16 Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands; thy walls are continually before me.                     <br>                     <br>17 Thy children shall make haste<u>;<\/u> thy destroyers and they that made thee waste shall go forth of thee.                     <br>                     <br>18 Lift up thine eyes round about<u>,<\/u> and behold<u>:<\/u> all these gather themselves together, and come to thee. <u>A<\/u>s I live, saith the Lord, thou shalt surely clothe thee with them all, as with an ornament, and bind them on <u>thee,<\/u> as a bride <u>doeth.<\/u>                     <br>                     <br>19 For thy waste and thy desolate places, and the land of thy destruction, shall even now be too narrow by reason of the inhabitants<u>,<\/u> and they that swallowed thee up shall be far away.                     <br>                     <br>20 The children <u>which<\/u> thou shalt have, after thou hast lost the <u>other<\/u>, shall <i>say again in thine ears<\/i><u>,<\/u> The place is too strait for me<u>:<\/u> give place to me that I may dwell.                     <br>                     <br>21 Then shalt thou say in thine heart<u>,<\/u> Who hath begotten me these, seeing I have lost my children, and am desolate, a captive, and removing to and fro? <u>a<\/u>nd who hath brought up these?
