    "html": " <p>This passage is a beautiful psalm of the Lord's loving-kindness, great goodness, and mercy to the repentant (63:7). Isaiah notes that the Lord claims faithful Israel as his people and his children. He was not only a father but a Savior (63:8). He bore their afflictions; he redeemed them \"in his love and in his pity\"; he carried them in their time of need (63:9). \"But they rebelled,\" making God their enemy, \"and he fought against them\" (63:10). Then they remembered his goodness to the people in the time of Moses. He had led them (an idea repeated three times in 63:11-13) and blessed them with his Spirit (63:14), and, by implication, so will he do again.<\/p> <blockquote> I will mention the <i>lovingkindnesses<\/i> <u>of the Lord<\/u>,     <br>and the <i>praises<\/i> <u>of the Lord<\/u>,     <br>according to <i>all that the Lord hath bestowed<\/i> on <u>us<\/u>,     <br>and the <i>great goodness<\/i> toward the <u>house of Israel<\/u>,     <br>which he hath bestowed on them <i>according to<\/i> <u>his mercies<\/u>,     <br>and <i>according to<\/i> the multitude of <u>his lovingkindnesses<\/u>. (63:7)     <br>For he said, Surely <i>they are my people,<\/i>     <br>children that will not lie:     <br>so <i>he was their Saviour.<\/i> (63:8)     <br><i>In all their affliction<\/i> <u>he was afflicted<\/u>, and the angel of his presence saved them:     <br><i>in his love and in his pity<\/i> <u>he redeemed them<\/u>;     <br>and he <i>bare<\/i> <u>them<\/u>,     <br>and <i>carried<\/i> <u>them<\/u> all the days of old. (63:9)     <br>But they <i>rebelled,<\/i>     <br>and <i>vexed his holy Spirit:<\/i>     <br>therefore <i>he was turned<\/i> to be <u>their enemy<\/u>,     <br>and <i>he fought<\/i> <u>against them<\/u>. (63:10)     <br>Then he remembered the days of old, Moses, and his people, saying,     <br><i>Where is he<\/i> that <u>brought them up out of the sea<\/u> with the shepherd of his flock?     <br><i>where is he<\/i> that <u>put his holy Spirit within him<\/u>? (63:11)     <br>That <i>led them<\/i> by the right hand of Moses with his glorious arm, dividing the water before them, to make himself an <u>everlasting name<\/u>? (63:12)     <br>That <i>led them<\/i> through the deep, as an horse in the wilderness, that they should not stumble? (63:13)     <br>As a beast goeth down into the valley, the Spirit of the Lord caused him to rest:     <br>so didst thou <i>lead thy people,<\/i> to make thyself a <u>glorious name<\/u>.
