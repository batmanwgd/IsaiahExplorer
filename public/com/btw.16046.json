Rahab and the Dragon. <\/b>Isaiah speaks in the place of covenant Israel and asks the Lord to \"awake\" and \"put on strength.\" Rahab \"is a poetic synonym for Egypt (Psalm 87:4). In a more general way, Rahab may be interpreted as a representation of Satan. In any case, the point of the imagery is that the Lord has power over all the elements and all of his enemies\" (<i>Book of Mormon Reference Companion,<\/i> 355).  <\/p>  ",
