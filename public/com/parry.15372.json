With thousands of enemy soldiers camped outside Jerusalem's gates, waiting to destroy the inhabitants, Hezekiah petitions the Lord through prayer in the house of the Lord. The Lord hears his prayer and sends an angel, who destroys 185,000 men in the Assyrian camp, thus saving Hezekiah and his people from destruction (37:36).<\/i><\/p> <p><i>The Assyrian wars constitute a \"day of trouble\" for Israel (37:3), anticipating our own day when the warring nations of the earth cause fear in the hearts of many. It would be well if, like Hezekiah of old, the various leaders of the world sought the Lord's counsel and the counsel of his prophets.<\/i><\/p> ",
