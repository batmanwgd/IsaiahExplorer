Not qualifying to participate in the new exodus to Zion, they continue to expiate their iniquities and to endure the curses that accrued. Didn&rsquo;t Jehovah&rsquo;s servant warn them that they had forgotten their God, their <em>salvation<\/em>, and not remembered the <em>Rock<\/em>, their fortress (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTc5OTQ=\">Isaiah 17:10<\/a>)? Didn&rsquo;t he exhort them to forsake their corrupt ways and thoughts and return to Jehovah so he would pardon them (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTg3NDg=\">Isaiah 55:7<\/a>)?<\/p><p>Realizing their error, however, they learned sufficiently from the servant&rsquo;s example to emulate his <em>righteousness<\/em>. Although subject to Jehovah&rsquo;s <em>anger<\/em>&mdash;the king of Assyria\/Babylon (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTc4NTY=\">Isaiah 10:5<\/a>)&mdash;they receive a second chance to overcome the chaotic consequences of their actions. Although still under a curse, Jehovah&rsquo;s &ldquo;ways&rdquo; are becoming their ways (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTg3NDk=\">Isaiah 55:8<\/a>) as they wade through their descent phase to recovery. Notwithstanding their transgressions weakened them almost irreversibly&mdash;their dysfunctional patterns being difficult to overcome&mdash;they are set on a return path (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzg3MSI6M30=\">Isaiah 10:20-22<\/a>).<\/p>",
