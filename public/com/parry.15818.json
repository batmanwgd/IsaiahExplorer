Anything that dulls the senses also dulls one's commitment to God and his ways (<a class=\"ref\">Hosea 4:11<\/a>), making it more difficult to detect the still, small voice of the Spirit. Those who persist in such a path will be given to drink of a different kind of wine, \"the wine of the fierceness of his wrath\" (<a class=\"ref\">Rev. 16:19<\/a>). <\/p> ",
