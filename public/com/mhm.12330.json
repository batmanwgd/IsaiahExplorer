    "html": "<p>In this chapter we have, I. God coming towards his people in ways of mercy and deliverance, and this is to be joined to the close of the foregoing chapter, where it was said to Zion, \"Behold, thy salvation comes \" for here it is shown how it comes, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODg2OCI6Nn0=\">Isaiah 63:1-6<\/a> . II. God's people meeting him with their devotions, and addressing themselves to him with suitable affections and this part of the chapter is carried on to the close of the next. In this we have, 1. A thankful acknowledgment of the great favours God had bestowed upon them, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODc0XQ==\">Isaiah 63:7<\/a> . 2. The magnifying of these favours, from the consideration of God's relation to them (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODc1XQ==\">Isaiah 63:8<\/a>), his compassionate concern for them (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODc2XQ==\">Isaiah 63:9<\/a>), their unworthiness (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODc3XQ==\">Isaiah 63:10<\/a>), and the occasion which it gave both him and them to call to mind former mercies, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODg3OCI6NH0=\">Isaiah 63:11-14<\/a> . 3. A very humble and earnest prayer to God to appear for them in their present distress, pleading God's mercy (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODgyXQ==\">Isaiah 63:15<\/a>), their relation to him (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODgzXQ==\">Isaiah 63:16<\/a>), their desire towards him (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODg0XQ==\">Isaiah 63:17<\/a>), and the insolence of their enemies, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODg1XQ==\">Isaiah 63:18<\/a> . So that, upon the whole, we learn to embrace God's promises with an active faith, and then to improve them, and make use of them, both in prayers and praises.<\/p> ",
