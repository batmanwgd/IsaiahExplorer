    "html": "<p><em>For the vile person<\/em>&mdash;Hebrew, &lsquo;The fool.&rsquo; This word more properly expresses the idea than &lsquo;vile person.&rsquo; The Hebrews Used the name fool to denote not only one destitute of understanding, but a knave, a dishonest man&mdash;regarding sin as the highest folly (see <a class=\"ref\">1 Samuel 25:25; 2 Samuel 3:33; Job 2:10<\/a>).<\/p><p><em>Will speak villainy<\/em>&mdash;Hebrew, &lsquo;Will speak folly.&rsquo; That is, he will act in accordance with his nature; it is his nature to speak folly, and he will do it. Under a wicked and unjust administration such persons might be the subjects flattery <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MjY1XQ==\">Isaiah 32:5<\/a> , and might be raised to office and power. But under the administration of a virtuous king they would not be admitted to favor; and the reason was, that they would act out their nature, and would corrupt all around them. A monarch, therefore, who regarded the honor of his own throne, and the welfare of his subjects, would exclude them from his counsels.<\/p><p><em>To make empty the soul of the hungry<\/em>&mdash;Probably this refers to spiritual hunger and thirst; and means that such a person would take away the means of knowledge from the people, and leave them to error, ignorance, and want. The sense is, that if such persons were raised to office, they would corrupt the nation and destroy their confidence in God; and this was a reason why a virtuous prince would exclude them from any participation in his government.<\/p> ",
