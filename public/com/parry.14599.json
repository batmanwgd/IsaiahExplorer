The Israelites, like the ox and the ass, must rely on their master (God) for food and must be led to water (<a class=\"ref\">Gen. 49:14-15; Hosea 8:8-9<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\">Mosiah 12:5; 21:3<\/a>). The ox and ass are dumb animals, yet they still obey their master; the children of Israel do not obey their master.<\/p> <p><i>owner\/master.<\/i> These symbols refer to the Lord, who is the owner and master of Israel and his people. The Hebrew for <i>owner<\/i> here means someone who has <i>purchased<\/i> an item rather than receiving it through other means such as inheriting it, being given it, or simply finding it. Christ is the purchaser; he purchased us through his atoning sacrifice. This idea is taught by Paul concerning the \"church of God, which he [Jesus] hath purchased with his own blood\" (<a class=\"ref\">Acts 20:28; 1 Cor. 6:20<\/a>). <\/p> ",
