Or, as<span class=\"hebrew_text\"> \u05e4\u05e2\u05dc\u05d5 \u05dc\u05e0\u05d9\u05e6\u05d5\u05e6<\/span> , may be rendered,<i> his work shall become a spark,<\/i> shall be the cause of his destruction. \u201cThe words are elegant, and the meaning of them is, that the rich, the powerful, the great, (meant by the word<span class=\"hebrew_text\"> \u05d4\u05d7\u05e1\u05df<\/span> , which we render<i> strong,<\/i>) who seemed like a lofty and well-rooted oak, shall perish with their<i> works:<\/i> for their works, their great and wicked undertakings, by which they had sought safety, like sparks, shall set them on fire and consume them like tow. They shall perish, like fools, by their own devices. The very works themselves, which they had raised for the glory and preservation of themselves and their republic, shall be turned into the very cause of their destruction. Vitringa thinks the prophet alludes to the destruction of their state and temple by the Romans.\u201d \u2014 Dodd.<\/p> ",
