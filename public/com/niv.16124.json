He said:<\/p>         <blockquote>             <p> \u201cDo not call conspiracy<\/p>             <p>\u2003everything that these people call conspiracy;<\/p>             <p>do not fear what they fear,<\/p>             <p>\u2003and do not dread it.<\/p>             <p>The L<small>ORD<\/small> Almighty is the one you are to regard as holy,<\/p>             <p>\u2003he is the one you are to fear,<\/p>             <p>\u2003he is the one you are to dread,<\/p>             <p> and he will be a sanctuary;<\/p>             <p>\u2003but for both houses of Israel he will be<\/p>             <p>a stone that causes men to stumble<\/p>             <p>\u2003and a rock that makes them fall.<\/p>             <p>And for the people of Jerusalem he will be<\/p>             <p>\u2003a trap and a snare.<\/p>             <p>Many of them will stumble;<\/p>             <p>\u2003they will fall and be broken,<\/p>             <p>\u2003they will be snared and captured.\u201d<\/p>             <p>Bind up the testimony<\/p>             <p>\u2003and seal up the law among my disciples.<\/p>             <p> I will wait for the L<small>ORD<\/small>,<\/p>             <p>\u2003who is hiding his face from the house of Jacob.<\/p>             <p>I will put my trust in him.<\/p>         <\/blockquote>         <p>\u2003Here am I, and the children the L<small>ORD<\/small> has given me. We are signs and symbols in Israel from the L<small>ORD<\/small> Almighty, who dwells on Mount Zion.<\/p>         <p>\u2003When men tell you to consult mediums and spiritists, who whisper and mutter, should not a people inquire of their God? Why consult the dead on behalf of the living? To the law and to the testimony! If they do not speak according to this word, they have no light of dawn. Distressed and hungry, they will roam through the land; when they are famished, they will become enraged and, looking upward, will curse their king and their God. Then they will look toward the earth and see only distress and darkness and fearful gloom, and they will be thrust into utter darkness.<\/p>     <\/blockquote>     <h4>Original Meaning<\/h4>     <p>T<small>HIS CHAPTER IS<\/small> a continuation of the Immanuel sign and its implications, introduced in chapter 7. As will be discussed below, there is good reason to think that Isaiah\u2019s son Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz, who is introduced here, was the first fulfillment of that sign. He represents the negative impact of God\u2019s presence that results when both king and people have reckoned without that presence.<\/p>     <p>\u2003The material is presented in two sections. In 8:1\u201310, the circumstances of the child\u2019s birth are given and the significance of his name explained. The second section (8:11\u201322) deals more specifically with what Isaiah\u2019s response to the people\u2019s blindness is supposed to be (vv. 11\u201318) and with the manifestations and outcomes of that blindness (vv. 19\u201322).<\/p>     ",
