It was proposed that they should remain safely in Jerusalem until Sennacherib should himself come and remove them to his own land. He was now engaged in the siege of Lachish <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MzMzXQ==\">Isaiah 36:2 <\/a>,, and it is probable that he purposed to take some other of the unsubdued towns in that part of Palestine. <\/p> <p> <em>And take you away <\/em>&mdash;It was common for conquerors in ancient times to remove a vanquished people from their own country. They did this either by sending them forth in colonies to people some unsettled region, or by removing the body of them to the land of the conqueror. This was done for various purposes. It was sometimes to make slaves of them; sometimes for the purposes of triumph; but more commonly to secure them from revolt. In this manner the ten tribes were removed from the kingdom of Samaria; and thus also the Jews were carried to Babylon. Suetonius says (chapter xxi.) of Augustus. that he removed the Suevi and the Sicambri into Gaul, and stationed them on the Rhine. The same thing was also practiced in Egypt, for the purpose of securing the people from revolt <a class=\"ref\">Genesis 47:21 <\/a>. <\/p> <p> <em>A land like your own land <\/em>&mdash;A fertile land, abounding in the same productions as your own. <\/p> <p> <em>And wine <\/em>&mdash;Palestine was celebrated for the vine. The idea is, that in the land to which he would remove them, they should not want. <\/p>,",
