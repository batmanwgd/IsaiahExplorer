The Lord's arm of judgment (or justice) in this verse is the same as the arm on which we may trust (the arm of mercy).<\/p> <p><i>isles.<\/i> The uttermost areas of the Lord's kingdom on earth (42:4; 60:9).<\/p> <p><i>on mine arm shall they trust.<\/i> The Lord's arm represents the Lord himself. To trust in the arm of the Lord is to trust in the Lord. In contrast is the arm of flesh, or the ability of man (including ourselves), in which we must never trust (<a class=\"ref\">2 Ne. 4:34; 28:31<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 1:19<\/a>). In a sense, the Lord's arm represents those who do his work with authority, specifically righteous priesthood holders.<\/p> ",
