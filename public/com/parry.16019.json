    "html": " <p> When the Lord comes in his glory, he will come with fire and the sword, bringing judgments on the wicked. The idea of fire is repeated five times in three verses: \"fire\" (three times), \"flames,\" and \"consumed\" (66:15-17). The idea of the anger of the Lord is repeated four times in two verses with such words as <i>indignation, anger, fury,<\/i> and <i>rebuke<\/i> (66:14-15). Through the fire and the sword, many will die (66:16). None of the wicked will escape (66:17-18). These things are sent by way of deliverance to the Lord's servants but as a judgment against his enemies (66:14). <a class=\"ref\">Ps. 18:6-17<\/a> gives us an interesting parallel description of this same event.<\/p> <blockquote>and the <i>hand of the Lord<\/i> shall be known <u>toward his servants<\/u>,     <br>and <i>his indignation<\/i> <u>toward his enemies<\/u>. (66:14b)     <br>For, behold, <i>the Lord<\/i> will come <u>with fire<\/u>,     <br>and with <i>his chariots<\/i> <u>like a whirlwind<\/u>,     <br>to render <i>his anger<\/i> <u>with fury<\/u>,     <br>and <i>his rebuke<\/i> <u>with flames of fire<\/u>. (66:15)     <br>For by fire and by his sword will the Lord plead with all flesh:     <br>and the slain of the Lord shall be many. (66:16)     <br>They that <i>sanctify<\/i> <u>themselves<\/u>,     <br>and <i>purify<\/i> <u>themselves<\/u> in the gardens behind one tree in the midst,     <br>eating <i>swine's flesh,<\/i>     <br>and the <i>abomination,<\/i>     <br>and the <i>mouse,<\/i>     <br>shall be consumed together, saith the Lord. (66:17)     <br>For I know their works and their thoughts: (66:18a)<\/blockquote> ",
