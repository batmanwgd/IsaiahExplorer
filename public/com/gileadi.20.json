    "html": "<p>Foreseeing his people&rsquo;s imminent calamity because they choose not to repent, the prophet grieves for them, the word &ldquo;How&rdquo; characterizing a lament (<a class=\"ref\">Lamentations 1:1; 2:1; 4:1<\/a>). In other words, the prophet is asking, &ldquo;How could this tragedy have happened? How is it that this people didn&rsquo;t repent in time? How could those who were once righteous become so wicked?&rdquo; The term &ldquo;harlot&rdquo; attests to their broken covenant relationship with Jehovah their husband (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODc2OSI6MTF9\">Isaiah 57:3-13<\/a>). Besides identifying a specific place, the term &ldquo;city&rdquo; represents Jehovah&rsquo;s covenant people in general (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NTc1LDE4ODM2XQ==\">Isaiah 45:13; 60:14<\/a>).<\/p><p><em>She was filled with justice. Righteousness made her abode in her, but now murderers.<\/em> &ldquo;Justice&rdquo; (<em>mispat<\/em>) and &ldquo;righteousness&rdquo; (<em>sedeq<\/em>)&mdash;the basis of all covenant blessings and the underpinnings of a law-abiding society&mdash;have given way to injustice and unrighteousness. The term &ldquo;murderers&rdquo; reiterates the level of wickedness to which Jehovah&rsquo;s people have sunk. The term <em>righteousness<\/em> additionally identifies Jehovah&rsquo;s end-time servant who acts as an exemplar of righteousness to Jehovah&rsquo;s people (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODQ1NCwxODQ3N10seyIxODU5OCI6M31d\">Isaiah 41:2, 25; 46:11-13<\/a>) and whom Jehovah appoints to restore justice in the earth (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODQ4MiI6NH0=\">Isaiah 42:1-4<\/a>).<\/p>",
