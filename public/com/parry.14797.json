    "html": " <p>The Lord's word, which has application to both ancient and modern Israel, has been given to the house of Israel (9:8) through his prophets, and the Northern Kingdom of Israel will soon suffer destruction (9:9-12). Because the people do not seek the Lord (9:13), are hypocrites, speak follies, and work evil (9:17), he will destroy all levels of society, including its leaders, followers, false prophets, young men, and even those who are usually oppressed, such as the fatherless and widows (9:14-17).<\/p> <p>The destruction by fire is described with such terms as <i>burneth, fire, devour, kindle, roll up high in smoke, land darkened<\/i> (perhaps because of the smoke), and <i>fuel of the fire<\/i> (9:18-19). In addition, social chaos will rule and brotherly love will not be found (9:19-20), for family will fight against family and tribe will war against tribe (9:21). Those who make unrighteous and oppressive laws (lawmakers and judges) and who forget the poor, the widows, and the fatherless (10:1-2) will also suffer at the day of judgment and will be among the captives or slain (10:4); they will not be able to flee for help to other sources such as idols or other nations (10:3).<\/p> <p> <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzgzOCI6M30=\">Isa. 9:8-10<\/a>:4 is divided into four subsections. The first subsection deals with pride (9:8-12), the second concerns evil leaders (9:13-17), the third decries the lack of love and kindness for others (9:18-21), and the fourth refers to social injustice (10:1-4). The four subsections are part of a single prophecy but are divided structurally with an identical poetic refrain at the end of each section: \"For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still\" (9:12, 17, 21; 10:4; see also 5:25).<\/p> <p>This prophecy has a dual fulfillment: first, when the ancient kingdom of Israel was destroyed, and second, when the world will be destroyed at the time of the second coming of Christ.<\/p> <blockquote> The Lord sent [his] <i>word<\/i> [<u>unto<\/u>] <u> Jacob <\/u>,     <br>and <i>it<\/i> hath [fallen] <u>upon Israel<\/u>. (9:8)     <br>And <i>all the people<\/i> shall know,     <br>even <i>Ephraim and the[inhabitant[s] of Samaria,<\/i>     <br>that say in the <i>pride<\/i>     <br>and<i> [haughtiness] of heart,<\/i> (9:9)     <br>The <i>bricks are fallen down,<\/i> but we will build with <u>hewn stones<\/u>:     <br>the <i>sycamores are cut down,<\/i> but we will change them into <u>cedars<\/u>. (9:10)     <br>Therefore the Lord <i>shall set up<\/i> the <u>adversaries<\/u> of Rezin against him,     <br>and <i>join<\/i> his <u>enemies<\/u> together; (9:11)     <br>The <i>Syrians<\/i> <u>before<\/u>,     <br>and the <i>Philistines<\/i> <u>behind<\/u>; (9:12)     <br>and they shall devour Israel with open mouth.     <br>For all this <i>his anger<\/i> is <u>not turned away<\/u>,     <br>but <i>his hand<\/i> is <u>stretched out still<\/u>.     <br>For the <i>people<\/i> <u>turneth<\/u> not <u>unto him<\/u> that smiteth them,     <br>neither do <i>they<\/i> <u>seek the Lord of hosts<\/u> (9:13)     <br>Therefore [will] the Lord cut off from Israel <i>head and tail,<\/i>     <br><i>branch and [bulrush stem] in one day. (9:14)<\/i>     <br>The <i>[elder], he is the <u>head<\/u>;<\/i>     <br>and the <i>prophet<\/i> that teacheth lies, he is the <u>tail<\/u>. (9:15)     <br>For the <i>leaders<\/i> of this people cause them to <u>err<\/u>;     <br>and they that are led of <i>them<\/i> are <u>destroyed<\/u>. (9:16)     <br>Therefore the Lord shall have <i>no joy<\/i> in their <u>young men<\/u>,     <br><i>neither shall have mercy<\/i> on their <u>fatherless and widows<\/u>:     <br>for <i>every one<\/i> [of them] <u>is an hypocrite and an evildoer<\/u>,     <br>and <i>every mouth<\/i> <u>speaketh folly<\/u>.     <br>For all this <i>his anger<\/i> is <u>not turned away<\/u>,     <br>but <i>his hand<\/i> is <u>stretched out still<\/u>. (9:17)     <br>For <u>wickedness <\/u><i>burneth<\/i> as the fire:     <br><i>it shall devour<\/i> the <u>briers and thorns<\/u>,     <br>and <i>shall kindle<\/i> in the <u>thickets<\/u> of the[forest[s], [so that it rolled up high in] smoke. (9:18)     <br>Through the wrath of the Lord of hosts is the land darkened, and the people shall be as the fuel of the fire: no man shall spare his brother. (9:19)     <br>And he shall <i>snatch on the right hand,<\/i> and <u>be hungry<\/u>;     <br>and he shall <i>eat on the left hand,<\/i> and they <u>shall not be satisfied<\/u>:     <br>they shall eat every man the flesh of his own arm: (9:20)     <br>Manasseh, Ephraim; and Ephraim, Manasseh:     <br><i>they together<\/i> shall be against Judah.     <br>For all this <i>his anger<\/i> is <u>not turned away<\/u>,     <br>but <i>his hand<\/i> is <u>stretched out still<\/u>.
