    "html": "<p>The term &ldquo;righteous&rdquo; or &ldquo;righteous one&rdquo; (<em>saddiq<\/em>) connotes individuals rather than a majority of Jehovah&rsquo;s people ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NjczLDE4NzU3XQ==\">Isaiah 50:10; 56:3<\/a>), in particular those who emulate his servant who exemplifies<em>righteousness<\/em> ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDU0LDE4Njc1LDE4NjgxXQ==\">Isaiah 41:2; 51:1, 7<\/a>). The &ldquo;godly&rdquo; (<em>&rsquo;anse-hesed<\/em>) defines those who have charity, who are true at all times toward others as the Hebrew term<em>hesed<\/em> implies. In the same way that angels delivered Lot from Sodom before its destruction ( <a class=\"ref\">Genesis 19:15-17<\/a>), so the kings and queens of the Gentiles&mdash;Jehovah&rsquo;s seraphs\/saviors&mdash;gather his elect out of destruction ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODY1OSI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 49:22-23<\/a>; cf. <a class=\"ref\">Matthew 24:31<\/a>).<\/p><p>While the righteous of Jehovah&rsquo;s people and the nations inherit peace and serenity ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODc4NSwxODEzNCwxODE0M10seyIxODI3NyI6NH0seyIxODMwMCI6NX0seyIxODczNyI6Mn0sWzE4NzUzLDE4OTM1XV0=\">v 19; Isaiah 26:3, 12; 32:17-20; 33:20-24; 54:13-14; 55:12; 66:12<\/a>), the unrighteous find no peace ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODc4NywxODYxMV0seyIxODYzMyI6Mn0sWzE4NjM3LDE4ODA5XV0=\">v 21; Isaiah 47:11; 48:18-19, 22; 59:8<\/a>). After the righteous are gathered out from destruction, those who remain suffer calamity as Jehovah&rsquo;s Day of Judgment overtakes them: &ldquo;I have charged my holy ones, called out my valiant ones: my anger is not upon those who take pride in me&rdquo; ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3OTEwXQ==\">Isaiah 13:3<\/a>). Instead of resting in their beds, the unrighteous find no rest ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODc4NiwxODA5MCwxODY3NCwxODczOV0seyIxODgxMCI6Mn0seyIxODkxMiI6Mn1d\">v 20; Isaiah 23:12; 50:11; 54:15; 59:9-10; 65:14-15<\/a>).<\/p> ",
