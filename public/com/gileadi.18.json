    "html": "<p>As noted, the essence of Jehovah&rsquo;s &ldquo;test&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NjczXQ==\">v 18<\/a>) is whether his people will repent. How? By their willingness to obey the law or terms of his covenant. The doubling of the Hebrew verbs &ldquo;willing&rdquo; and &ldquo;obey&rdquo; causes the first to modify the second. An alternative translation, therefore, is &ldquo;If you willingly obey, you shall eat the good of the land.&rdquo; Both the &ldquo;good&rdquo; or increase of the land and the land itself constitute covenant blessings (<a class=\"ref\">Deuteronomy 19:8; 28:3-5, 11-12<\/a>). The context of this verse is Jehovah&rsquo;s Day of Judgment, when he preserves alive those who repent of transgression (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzY2MiI6M30=\">vv 7-9<\/a>).<\/p> ",
