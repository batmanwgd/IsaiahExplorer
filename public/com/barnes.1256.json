    "html": "<p><em>When the boughs thereof are withered<\/em> &mdash;This is a further description of the desolation which would come upon Babylon. The idea is, that Babylon would be forsaken until the trees should grow and decay, and the branches should fall to be collected for burning. That is, the desolation should be entire, undisturbed, and long continued The idea of the desolation is, therefore, in this verse carried forward, and a new circumstance is introduced to make it more graphic and striking. Lowth, however, supposes that this refers to the vineyard, and to the fact that the vine-twigs are collected in the East from the scarcity of fuel for burning. But it seems to me that the obvious reference is to Babylon, and that it is an image of the great and prolonged desolation that was coming upon that city.<\/p><p><em>They shall be broken off<\/em> &mdash;That is, by their own weight as they decay, or by the hands of those who come to collect them for fuel.<\/p><p><em>The women come<\/em> &mdash;Probably it was the office mainly of the women to collect the fuel which might be necessary for culinary purposes. In eastern climates but little is needed; and that is collected of the twigs of vineyards, of withered stubble, straw, hay, dried roots, etc., wherever they can be found.<\/p><p><em>And set them on fire<\/em> &mdash;That is, to burn them for fuel.<\/p><p><em>Of no understanding<\/em> &mdash;Of no right views of God and his government&mdash;wicked, sinful<a class=\"ref\">Proverbs 6:32; Proverbs 18:2; Jeremiah 5:21<\/a> .<\/p> ",
