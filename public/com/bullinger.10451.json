    "html": "<p><em>saith.<\/em> Some codices, with Septuagint and Syriac, read <em>\"thus saith\"<\/em>. <\/p>\n\n<p><em>not.<\/em> Hebrew text = <i>l\"o <\/i>= not; but marked in margin to be read <i>lo =<\/i> to Him, which is confirmed by the list of such readings in the Massorah. If (in <em>\"be not gathered\"<\/em>), the negative be read, then the \"though\" and the \"yet\" must be retained; but if the preposition with suffix be read, then the rendering of the clause will be \"to bring Jacob again to Him, and that Israel unto Him might be gathered, and I be glorious\", &c. Probably both readings may be correct, for Israel was not gathered at His first coming (<a class=\"ref\">John 1:11<\/a>), but will be at His second coming. <\/p>\n\n<p><em>strength<\/em> = strength (for victory). Not the same word as in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 49:4<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>Hebrew. <i>\"azaz.<\/i> <\/p>",
