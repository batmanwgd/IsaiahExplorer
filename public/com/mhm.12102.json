A threatening of the paucity and scarceness of man  (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTc3MzU=\">Isaiah 4:1<\/a>),  which might fitly enough have been added to the close of the foregoing  chapter, to which it has a plain reference.  II. A promise of the restoration of Jerusalem's peace and purity,  righteousness and safety, in the days of the Messiah,   <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzczNiI6NX0=\">Isaiah 4:2-6<\/a>.  Thus, in wrath, mercy is remembered, and gospel grace is a sovereign  relief, in reference to the terrors of the law and the desolations made  by sin.<\/p>",
