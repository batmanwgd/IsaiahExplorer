    "html": "<p>It is apparent from chapters 6-8 how alone Isaiah must have felt in his prophetic ministry in the face of his people&rsquo;s estrangement from their God. Jehovah&rsquo;s &ldquo;clasping my hand&rdquo; suggests both comfort and empowerment and denotes royal investiture in ancient Near Eastern emperor-vassal covenants. While many of &ldquo;these people&rdquo;&mdash;Jehovah&rsquo;s alienated people&mdash;live in fear of conspiracies, the existence of conspiracies shouldn&rsquo;t frighten them but cause them to turn back to their God. A righteous or reverential fear and awe of Jehovah serve as a safeguard against transgressing against his law and word.<\/p> ",
