This is another argument urged for the divinity of the God of Israel, namely, his foreknowledge and prediction of future events, of which the prophet subjoins a particular instance in the next words. <i>Calling a ravenous bird,<\/i> or<i>eagle, from the east<\/i>\u2014From Persia, as <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDU0XQ==\">Isaiah 41:2<\/a>. \u201cThere can be no doubt that Cyrus is here meant. Kings and princes are often compared in Scripture to eagles, <a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 49:22; Ezekiel 17:3<\/a>. But it has been thought that there is a peculiar propriety in this application to Cyrus, as the eagle well denotes the magnanimity, the quickness of judgment, the celerity in all his expeditions and motions, for which Cyrus was so remarkable. We are also told by Plutarch, that Cyrus had an aquiline nose; and Xenophon expressly relates, that his standard was a golden eagle; which yet continues, says he, to be the standard of the Persian kings.\u201d\u2014Vitringa.<\/p> ",
