He speaks primarily to Moab and Syria, neighboring nations immediately east of the Jordan Valley. The Syrians to the northeast of Israel were distant Semitic relatives, while the Moabites to the southeast were more closely related, as they were descendants of Abraham's nephew, Lot. Some Israelite tribes, Gad, Reuben, and part of Manesseh, occupied the territories east of the Jordan River (the Transjordan), and Isaiah also included some promises for them.<\/p>",
