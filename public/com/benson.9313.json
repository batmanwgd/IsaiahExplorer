Who does not think one thing and speak another, but whose word is to him as sacred as his oath; <i>that despiseth the gain of oppressions <\/i>\u2014Who is so far from coveting gain unjustly gotten, that he despises it; thinks it a mean and sordid, as well as a wicked thing, to enrich himself by any injustice done to, or hardship put upon, his neighbour; <i>that shaketh his hands from holding <\/i> <i>of bribes <\/i>\u2014Or, from <i>taking,<\/i>, or <i>receiving<\/i>, them, as <span class=\"hebrew_text\">,\u05ea\u05de\u05da\u05b0<\/span>, is often rendered; who will not <i>receive,<\/i>, much less will retain bribes; <i>that stoppeth his ears,<\/i>,&c.\u2014Who will not assent, or even hearken, to any counsels or practices tending to shed innocent blood; or to any kind of cruelty toward any one; or to any suggestions inciting him to revenge; <i>and shutteth his eyes from seeing evil <\/i>\u2014That abhors the very sight of sin committed by others, and who himself watches against the occasions of it. Those that would preserve the purity of their souls, must keep a strict guard on the senses of their bodies; stop their ears to temptations, and turn away their eyes from beholding vanity. <i>He shall dwell on high <\/i>\u2014Out of the reach of danger; <i>his place of defence\u2014the munitions of rocks <\/i>\u2014The divine power will keep him safe, as though he were in a tower, strong and impregnable, fortified by nature as well as art. God, the Rock of ages, will be his place of defence. <i>Bread shall be given him,<\/i>,&c.\u2014God will furnish him with all things needful. They that fear the Lord shall not want any thing that is good for them. <\/p>",
