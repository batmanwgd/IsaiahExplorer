    "html": "<p><em>And the eyes of them that see...<\/em>&mdash;The sense of this verse is, that there shall be, under the reign of this wise and pious prince, on the part of the prophets and teachers, a clear view of divine truth, and on the part of the people who hear, a disposition to hearken and to attend to it. The phrase &lsquo;of them that see,&rsquo; refers probably to the prophets, as those who were called seers (see the notes at <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MjI4XQ==\">Isaiah 29:10; Isaiah 30:10<\/a> ; compare <a class=\"ref\">1 Samuel 9:9<\/a> ), or those who had visions (see the note at <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 1:1<\/a> ) of the things that God would communicate to people. The word rendered &lsquo;be dim&rsquo; (\u05ea\u05e9\u05c1\u05e2\u05d9\u05e0\u05d4 tishe\u201beyna\u0302h), is derived from \u05e9\u05c1\u05e2\u05d4 sha\u0302\u201ba\u0302h, which usually signifies &ldquo;to see, to look,&rdquo; but it also has a meaning similar to \u05e9\u05c1\u05e2\u05e2 sha\u0302\u201ba\u201b, &ldquo;to spread over, to close, to make blind.&rdquo; Of this fact Lowth seems not to have been aware when he proposed, without the authority of any MS., to change the text. The sense is, that those who were prophets and religious teachers should no more see obscurely, but should have clear and just views of divine truth.<\/p><p><em>And the ears of them that hear<\/em>&mdash;Of the people who were instructed by their religious teachers.<\/p><p><em>Shall hearken<\/em>&mdash;It shall be a characteristic of those times that they shall be disposed to attend to the truth of God.<\/p>",
