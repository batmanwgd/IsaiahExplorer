    "html": "<p><a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODc4NSI6M30=\">Isaiah 57:19-21<\/a>.<i>I create <\/i>\u2014 I will, by my almighty power, in a wonderful manner produce; <i>the fruit of the lips <\/i>\u2014 Praise and thanksgiving, termed the fruit of the lips, <a class=\"ref\">Hosea 14:2; Hebrews 13:15<\/a>. God creates this fruit of the lips, by giving new subjects and causes of thanksgiving, by his mercies conferred on those among his people, who acknowledge and bewail their transgressions, and return to him. <i>Peace, peace, <\/i>&c. \u2014 Here we have the great subject of thanksgiving, reconciliation with God, pardon and peace offered to them that <i>are nigh, <\/i>and to them that are <i>afar off; <\/i>not only to the Jew, but also to the Gentile, as St. Paul more than once applies those terms, <a class=\"ref\">Ephesians 2:13; Ephesians 2:17<\/a>. See also <a class=\"ref\">Acts 2:39<\/a>. The doubling of the word signifies the certainty and excellence of this peace. But though this peace be freely offered to all without exception, yet all will not partake of it, for <i>the wicked are like the troubled sea, <\/i>&c. \u2014 Their minds are restless, being perpetually hurried with their own lusts and passions, and with guilt, and the dread of divine vengeance. <i>There is no peace to the wicked <\/i>\u2014 Though they may have as great a share of outward prosperity as the best men have, yet they have no share in this inward, spiritual, and everlasting peace. The forty-eighth chapter ends with the same declaration; to express the exclusion of the impenitent and unbelieving from the benefit of the foregoing promises. <\/p>",
