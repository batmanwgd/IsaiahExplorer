Many in the world will see and know the righteousness of the people Zion, who will be known as a holy people. We will feel the love and approval of God for us. We can help to bring that day by calling on the Lord continually and by seeking to do our part through obedience and sacrifice, drawing near to the Lord as a bride draws near to her husband.<\/i><\/p> ",
