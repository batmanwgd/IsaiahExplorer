Israel had already passed through a long history, and Jehovah had presided over this, and ruled within it; and He had not so lost His power in consequence, as to have now left His people to themselves. He does not grow faint, as a man would do, who neglected to take the repeated nourishment requisite to sustain the energy of his vital power; nor does He become weary, like a man who has exhausted his capacity for work by over-exertion. And if He had not redeemed His people till then, His people were to know that His course was pure <em> t e bhu\u0304na\u0302h <\/em> or understanding, which was in the possession of infallible criteria for determining the right point of time at which to interpose with His aid.<\/p>",
