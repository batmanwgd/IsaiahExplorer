There they were addressed to the arm of Jehovah, and were the prelude of a glorious promise. Here they are spoken to Jerusalem as a drunken and desperate castaway, and introduce a painfully vivid picture of her desolation. They seem, indeed, prefixed to that picture to make it bearable. They are a call to Zion to wake out of that drunken sleep, and therefore show that her ruin is not irretrievable.<\/p> \n<p>The dregs of the cup.\u2014Literally, the goblet cup, but with the sense, as in the Authorised version, of the cup being drained.<\/p> ",
