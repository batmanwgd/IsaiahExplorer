    "html": " <p> <i>In that day. <\/i>,Here the Prophet speaks in general of the judgment of God, and thus includes the whole of Satan\u2019s kingdom. Having formerly spoken of the vengeance of God to be displayed against tyrants and wicked men who have shed innocent blood, he now proceeds farther, and publishes the proclamation of this vengeance. <\/p>,\n <p> <i>On leviathan. <\/i>,The word \u201cleviathan\u201d is variously interpreted; but in general it simply denotes either a large serpent, or whales and sea-fishes, which approach to the character of monsters on account of their huge size. A1though this description applies to the king of Egypt, yet under one class he intended also to include the other enemies of the Church. For my own part, I have no doubt that he speaks allegorically of Satan and of his whole kingdom, describing him under the figure of some monstrous animal, and at the same time glancing at the crafty wiles by which he glosses over his mischievous designs. In this manner he intended to meet many doubts by which we are continually assailed, when God declares that he will assist us, and when we experience, on the other hand, the strength, craft, and deceitfulness of Satan. Wonderful are the stratagems with which he comes prepared for doing mischief, and dreadful the cruelty which he exercises against the children of God. But the Prophet shews that all this will not prevent the Lord from destroying and overthrowing this kingdom. It is indeed certain that this passage does not relate to Satan himself, but to his agents or instruments, by which he governs his kingdom and annoys the Church of God. Now, though this kingdom is defended by innumerable cunning devices, and is astonishingly powerful, yet the Lord will destroy it. <\/p>,\n <p>To convince us of this, the Prophet contrasts with it <i>the Lord\u2019s sword, hard, and great, and strong, <\/i>,by which he will easily slay an enemy that is both strong and crafty. It ought therefore to be observed, that we have continually to do with Satan as with some wild beast, and that the world is the sea in which we sail. We are beset by various wild beasts, which endeavor to upset our ship and sink us to the bottom; and we have no means of defending ourselves and resisting them, if the Lord do not aid us. Accordingly, by this description the Prophet intended to describe the greatness of the danger which threatens us from enemies so powerful and so full of rage and of cunning devices. We should quickly be reduced to the lowest extremity, and should be utterly ruined, did not God oppose and meet them with his invincible power; for by his sword alone can this pernicious kingdom of Satan be destroyed. <\/p>,\n <p>But we must observe what he says in the beginning of the verse, <i>In that day <\/i>,. It means that Satan is permitted, for some time, to strengthen and defend his kingdom, but that it will at length be destroyed; as Paul also declares, \u201cGod will quickly bruise Satan under your feet.\u201d (<a class=\"ref\">Romans 16:20 <\/a>.) By this promise he shews that the time for war is not yet ended, and that we must fight bravely till that enemy be subdued, who, though he has been a hundred times vanquished, ceases not to renew the warfare. We must therefore fight with him continually, and must resist the violent attacks which he makes upon us; but, in order that we may not be discouraged, we must keep our eye on that day when his strong arm shall be broken. <\/p>,\n <p> <i>On leviathan the piercing serpent, and on leviathan the crooked serpent. <\/i>,The epithets applied to \u201cleviathan\u201d describe, on the one hand, his tricks and wiles, and, on the other hand, his open violence; but at the same time intimate that he is endued with invincible power.

The phrase <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d0\u05e0\u05e9\u05d9 \u05dc\u05e6\u05d5\u05df <\/span>,(\u0103 <i>nsh\u0113latzon <\/i>) literally signifies \u201cmen of scorn,\u201d and is so rendered by Stock and others; but the force of the Hebrew idiom is fully brought out by the word \u201cscoffers,\u201d as in Lowth, or by \u201cscornful men,\u201d as in the English Version. \u2014 <i>Ed <\/i> <\/p>,\n <p>FT486 \u201c <span class=\"aramaic_text\">,Ces moqueurs <\/span>,;\u201d\u2014\u201cThose mockers.\u201d <\/p>,\n <p>FT487 <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d7\u05d6\u05d4 <\/span>,(<i>ch\u014dz\u0115h <\/i>) is properly a participle (<i>seeing <\/i>) often used as a noun to denote a <i>seer <\/i>,or prophet. Here the connection seems distinctly to require the sense of league or covenant. That there is no error in the text may be inferred from the substitution of the cognate form <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d7\u05d6\u05d5\u05ea <\/span>,(<i>ch\u016dz\u016bth <\/i>) in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTgzXQ==\">Isaiah 28:18 <\/a>. Hitzig accounts for the transfer of meanings by the supposition that in making treaties it was usual to consult the <i>seer <\/i>,or prophet. Ewald supposes an allusion to the practice of necromantic art or divination as a safeguard against death, and translates the word <i>orafel <\/i>,, (<i>oracle <\/i>,.) The more common explanation of the usage traces it to the idea of an <i>interview <\/i>,or <i>meeting <\/i>,, and the act of looking one another in the face, from which the transition is by no means difficult to that of mutual understanding or agreement.\u201d \u2014 <i>Alexander <\/i>,.

Ver.) <\/p>,\n <p>FT495 \u201cThere are three interpretations of the last clause, one of which supposes it to mean, that the mere report of the approaching scourge should fill them with distress; another, that the effect of the report should be universal distress; a third, that nothing but a painful experience would enable them to understand the lesson which the Prophet was commissioned to teach them. <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05e9\u05de\u05d5\u05e2\u05d4 <\/span>,(<i>sh\u0115m\u016bgn\u0101h <\/i>) meaning simply what is heard, may of course denote either rumor or revelation. The latter seems to be the meaning in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTc0XQ==\">Isaiah 28:9 <\/a>,, where the noun stands connected with the same verb as here. Whether this verb ever means simply to perceive or hear, may be considered doubtful; if not, the preference is due to the third interpretation above given, viz., that nothing but distress or suffering could make them understand or even attend to the message from Jehovah.\u201d \u2014 <i>Alexander <\/i> <\/p>,\n <p>FT496 \u201c(lang. it) La sua opera strana, la sua operazione straordinaria;\u201d\u2014\u201cHis strange work, his extraordinary act.\u201d\u2014Ital.
