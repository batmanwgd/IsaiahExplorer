They quickly fall back upon themselves, when they are hard pressed by afflictions; and when they hear that anything is in the power of God, they do not think that it belongs to them. <\/p>,\n <p> <i>Who divide the sea. <\/i>,He does not speak in general terms, but brings forward the instance which he had often mentioned before; for, by once redeeming the fathers, he held out to posterity the hope of eternal salvation. Justly, therefore, does he exclaim that he is the same God who long ago \u201cdivided the sea;\u201d and next he magnifies the miracle by saying that its roaring billows were stilled at his command. (<a class=\"ref\">Exodus 14:21 <\/a>.) We ought to know, therefore, that there are no raging billows which God cannot allay and calm in order to deliver his Church. \u201cIt is he who,\u201d by his power, \u201cstills the sea and makes it calm,\u201d (<a class=\"ref\">Job 26:12 <\/a>,,) though it rage furiously; and he likewise drives and swells its waves, when he thinks fit; though literally, as I have remarked, the Prophet alludes to the history of the deliverance from Egypt. <\/p>,\n <p> <i>Jehovah of hosts. <\/i>,The Lord is adorned with this title, that we may know how extensive is his power; and he exhibits that power as often as he is pleased to render assistance to his Church. <\/p>,",
