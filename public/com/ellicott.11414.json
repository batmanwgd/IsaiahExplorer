Hezekiah\u2019s son Manasseh, at the time when Isaiah spoke unborn, was carried as a prisoner to Babylon by Esar-haddon, king of Assyria ( <a class=\"ref\">2 Chronicles 33:11<\/a>). The last lineal heir of the house of David, Jehoiachin, died there after long years of imprisonment ( <a class=\"ref\">2 Kings 25:27<\/a>). Daniel and his three companions were \u201cof the king\u2019s seed and of the princes,\u201d and were, probably, themselves reduced to that state, placed under the care of \u201cthe master of the ennuchs\u201d ( <a class=\"ref\">Daniel 1:3<\/a>). The actual treasures which Hezekiah showed were probably handed over to Sennacherib ( <a class=\"ref\">2 Kings 18:15-16<\/a>); but looking to the fact that that king records his capture of Babylon, after defeating Merodach-baladan, and established his son Esar-haddon there (Lenormant, Ancient History, i., p. 400), it is probable enough that the treasures may have been taken thither, and displayed, as if in irony, to the king and the counsellors, who had hoped to profit by them. Sennacherib indeed boasts that he had carried off not only the king\u2019s treasures, and his musicians to Nineveh, but his daughters also (Records of the Past, vii. 63).<\/p> ",
