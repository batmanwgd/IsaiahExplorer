The name has been derived (1) from Ma-m-pthah (\u201cthe house of Pthah,\u201d an Egyptian deity of the Heph\u00e6stos, or Yulcan type); or (2), and more correctly, from Men-nepher (\u201cplace of the good\u201d). This also was, as in <a class=\"ref\">Hosea 9:6<\/a>,(where we have the form Moph), one of the chief royal cities of Lower Egypt, and the seat of the Ethiopian dynasty then ruling. <\/p>\n <p>Even they that are the stay of the tribes thereof.\u2014Better, the corner-stone of the castes. The word is the same as the \u201ccorner\u201d of <a class=\"ref\">Zechariah 10:4<\/a>, the \u201cchief\u201d of <a class=\"ref\">Judges 20:2; 1 Samuel 14:38<\/a>, and describes the position of superiority among the Egyptian castes claimed by the priest-rulers of Zoan and Noph. <\/p>",
