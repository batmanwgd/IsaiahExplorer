    "html": "<p>The next step toward the restoration of Jehovah&rsquo;s people is for them to gain an awareness of who they are&mdash;of their true identity as covenant people of the God of Israel. Once they &ldquo;recognize,&rdquo; &ldquo;believe,&rdquo; and &ldquo;perceive&rdquo; that their restoration was foretold by prophets, and that now is the time of its implementation, they may resume their role as Jehovah&rsquo;s collective &ldquo;servant&rdquo; or vassal and become &ldquo;witnesses&rdquo; of his truth ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg1NDAiOjN9LHsiMTg1ODIiOjN9XQ==\">Isaiah 44:6-8; 45:20-22<\/a>). Their very restoration as his people serves as proof that Jehovah alone&mdash;not the nations, their leaders, or their gods&mdash;is their God ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg1NjYiOjN9LHsiMTg4MzIiOjd9XQ==\">Isaiah 45:4-6; 60:10-16<\/a>).<\/p> ",
