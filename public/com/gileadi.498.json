Once they &ldquo;recognize,&rdquo; &ldquo;believe,&rdquo; and &ldquo;perceive&rdquo; that their restoration was foretold by prophets, and that now is the time of its implementation, they may resume their role as Jehovah&rsquo;s collective &ldquo;servant&rdquo; or vassal and become &ldquo;witnesses&rdquo; of his truth (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 44:6-8; 45:20-22<\/a>). Their very restoration as his people serves as proof that Jehovah alone&mdash;not the nations, their leaders, or their gods&mdash;is their God (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 45:4-6; 60:10-16<\/a>).<\/p>",
