In our day it is a representation of the wickedness of the world. In fact, the Lord Himself equated the \"midst of wickedness\" with \"spiritual Babylon.\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 133:14<\/a>.) The ancient city appeared to be impregnable to attack, with walls said to be 56 miles in circumference, 335 feet high, and 85 feet wide. Yet, as foreseen by Isaiah, this fortress of ancient Babylonia fell. The plea to come forth out of today's Babylon (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 133:5, 7, 14<\/a>) is the clarion call to modern Israel to escape from the Babylonian bondage of wickedness to the freedom and light of the gospel of Jesus Christ (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 45:9; 50:24; 88:86<\/a>.)<\/p>",
