While it is possible that several originally independent pieces have been put together here (vv. 1\u20134, 5\u20137, 8\u201315), the use of the same terms for God in the opening and closing verses (\u201cthe Lord, the L<small>ORD<\/small> Almighty\u201d) and the continued attention to leadership argue that the collection is not an accidental one. It begins with the assertion that the things Judah has trusted in apart from God will be removed. Not only will this include the obvious things such as food and water (v. 1), but even more significantly (on the basis of the amount of space given), all the great leaders from \u201cwarriors\u201d (v. 2) to \u201cenchanters\u201d (v. 3) on whom Judah has depended. They have trusted in mere breath-filled humans (2:22), and now they will be deprived of such leadership. This is not merely because to place such trust in them was wrong in the first place, but also because the leaders have failed in their responsibilities (3:13\u201315).<\/p>     <p>\u2003The Judeans have idolized the great men, somehow believing that such people will deliver them from their difficulties. But God is going to deprive the people of their false security (3:1\u20133). Instead of great men, mere \u201cboys\u201d will be their leaders (3:4), people lacking either the maturity or the moral authority to administer the nation in a just way. The result will be anarchy, with violence undermining the last vestiges of order (3:5).<\/p>     <p>\u2003It is probable that Isaiah has in mind here typical conditions following the defeat of a nation and the exile of its leaders and craftsmen. They are certainly similar to the conditions described in Jeremiah 40\u201342. The connection with exile is further reinforced by the vignette in Isaiah 3:6\u20137. Since no one with natural leadership skills is left to govern \u201cthis heap of ruins,\u201d even the possession of a cloak (as a badge of office?) will be considered all that is necessary to assume a leadership position\u2014but such a person will not take the job. This is how far, the prophet says, we are going to go in humiliation after having exalted our great men so high.<\/p>     <p>\u2003The connection of the forgoing with 2:6\u201322 is underscored by 3:8\u20139. Judah\u2019s sin is arrogance. They have defied \u201cthe eyes of his glory\u201d (lit.; NIV \u201chis glorious presence\u201d), which reminds us immediately of the \u201ceyes of the arrogant\u201d in 2:11. God\u2019s eyes are the only ones that can be legitimately lifted up over the world, and to defy him by lifting up our eyes is foolish. Ultimately, it is to commit the sin of \u201cSodom\u201d and Gomorrah, which was not first of all sexual sin but the insistence of the residents that they had the right to determine right and wrong for themselves. The only result of such pride is \u201cdisaster.\u201d<\/p>     <p>\u2003Verses 10\u201311 underline the cause-and-effect nature of relations with God. He is not arbitrary in his judgments. If \u201cwoe\u201d comes upon the wicked, the righteous need to know that \u201cit will be well with them.\u201d As in the physical world, so it is in the spiritual world. We have been made to operate within certain parameters. If we do so, we may expect positive results. If we choose to live outside those parameters, we should not be surprised if negative results follow.<\/p>     <p>\u2003Verses 12\u201315 detail God\u2019s judgment on the leaders whom Judah has idolized. Why will they be removed? Why will they be taken into captivity? Why will their nation be humiliated? The simple answer is that they are not great men at all. They may appear so, and the people may praise them as if they are, but their behavior makes it plain that they are not qualified to lead. They are \u201cyouths\u201d and \u201cwomen,\u201d two categories of persons who in that society had neither the training nor the status to give leadership. These elders of the people oppress the poor, \u201cgrinding\u201d their \u201cfaces\u201d in the dirt. Instead of denying themselves to tend the Lord\u2019s \u201cvineyard,\u201d the nation of Judah, they have \u201cruined\u201d it with their greed for gain and their lust for power.<\/p>     ",
