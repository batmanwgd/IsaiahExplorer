While Jehovah redeems spiritually all who repent of transgression (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc4NTkiOjJ9LHsiMTg1MzEiOjF9LHsiMTg1NTYiOjF9LHsiMTg3MTYiOjN9LHsiMTg3MjkiOjJ9LHsiMTg4MjEiOjF9XQ==\">vv 8-9; Isaiah 43:25; 44:22; 53:4-6; 54:5, 8; 59:20<\/a>), his servant delivers them physically. Because the servant does so in part by empowering Jehovah&rsquo;s servants who serve as proxy saviors under the terms of the Davidic Covenant (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg4NDciOjJ9XQ==\">Isaiah 61:3, 6<\/a>), their redemptive ministry, as noted, forms an integral part of Jehovah&rsquo;s &ldquo;day of vengeance&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg4NDYiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 61:2<\/a>).<\/p>",
