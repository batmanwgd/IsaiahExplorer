(<a class=\"ref\">Exodus 12:39; 16:1-36<\/a>.) The flight from Babylon must be final; there should be no lusting after the former \"flesh pots of Egypt\" (<a class=\"ref\">Exodus 16:3<\/a>) nor looking back on the sinful ways of Sodom (<a class=\"ref\">Genesis 19:15-26<\/a>). There must be a deliberate and careful plan to leave behind the ways of the world and to be irrevocably committed to the God of Israel, even Jesus Christ.<\/p>",
