For those who depend for their very existence on the continued grace of a loving Creator to act as if they are somehow ultimate is the worst trespass upon reality imaginable. Oftentimes, the pagan deification of humanity expresses itself in the fiction that the gods, made in human form, are the stars. In fact, says Isaiah, the opposite is true. Far from the stars being the guarantee of our lordship of creation, they are the dutiful servants of the Almighty, and they will not escape the cataclysms when he punishes rebellious earth. He will darken them and shake them (13:10, 13).<\/p>         ",
