    "html": "<p><em>Behold, they shall be as stubble<\/em> &mdash;They shall be no more able to resist the judgments which are coming upon the city, than dry stubble can resist the action of the fire. A similar figure is used in<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3Njg2XQ==\">Isaiah 1:31<\/a> (see the notes at that verse). Compare also<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MjAwXQ==\">Isaiah 29:6<\/a> ;<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MjQ4XQ==\">Isaiah 30:30<\/a> , where fire is a symbol of the devouring judgments of God.<\/p><p><em>They shall not deliver themselves<\/em> &mdash;Margin, as Hebrew, &lsquo;Their souls.&rsquo; The meaning is, that they would be unable to protect themselves from the calamities which would come upon them and the city.<\/p><p><em>There shall not be a coal to warm at<\/em> &mdash;The meaning is, that they would be entirely consumed&mdash;so completely, that not even a coal or spark would be left, as when stubble, or a piece of wood, is entirely burned up. According to this interpretation, the sense is, that the judgments of God would come upon them and the city, so that entire destruction would ensue. Rosenmuller, however, Cocceius, and some others, suppose this should be rendered, &lsquo;there shall not remain a coal so that bread could be baked by it.&rsquo; But the more common, and more correct interpretation, is that suggested above. Compare Gesenius and Rosenmuller on the place.<\/p> ",
