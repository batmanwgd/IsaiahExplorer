    "title": "Anarchy and Ruin Prophesied for Jerusalem and Judah",
    "html": " <p> Isaiah prophesies that anarchy and ruin will come upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem and Judah because of the sinful nature of their inhabitants, whose speech and actions are against the Lord, and whose sins are likened to the sins committed in Sodom before its destruction (3:8-9). Anarchy may also come because of the Lord's removing the supply of bread and water (famine or drought), or by the loss of righteous leadership in the region, for God, we are told, will remove the region's luminaries (3:2-3), and children, babes, and women will become the rulers (3:4, 12). These prophecies seem to have a double application, referring to judgments against ancient Judah as well as against the wicked in the last days.<\/p> <blockquote> For, behold, the Lord, the Lord of hosts, doth take away from Jerusalem and from Judah     <br>the <i>[supply] and the <u>staff<\/u>,<\/i>     <br>the whole [<u>staff<\/u>] of bread, and the whole <i>[supply]<\/i> of water, (3:1)     <br>The <i>mighty<\/i> <i>man,<\/i>     <br>and the <i>man<\/i> <i>of<\/i> <i>war,<\/i>     <br>the <i>judge,<\/i>     <br>and the <i>prophet,<\/i>     <br>and the [<i>one<\/i> <i>who<\/i> <i>practices<\/i> <i>divination<\/i>] ,     <br>and the [<i>elder<\/i>] , (3:2)     <br>The <i>captain<\/i> <i>of<\/i> <i>fifty,<\/i>     <br>and the <i>honourable<\/i> <i>man,<\/i>     <br>and the <i>counsellor,<\/i>     <br>and the [<i>skilled<\/i> <i>craftsman<\/i>] ,     <br>and the <i>eloquent<\/i> <i>orator.<\/i> (3:3)     <br>And I will give <i>children<\/i> [unto them] to <u>be their princes<\/u>,     <br>and <i>babes<\/i> shall <u>rule over them<\/u>. (3:4)     <br>And the people shall be oppressed, every <i>one<\/i> by <u>another<\/u>,     <br>and every <i>one<\/i> by his <u>neighbour<\/u>:     <br>the <i>child<\/i> shall behave himself proudly against the <u>ancient<\/u>,     <br>and the <i>base <\/i>against the <u>honourable<\/u>. (3:5)     <br>When a man shall take hold of his <i>brother<\/i> of the <u>house<\/u> of his father, [and shall say]:     <br>Thou hast clothing, be thou our ruler, and let [not] this ruin [come] under thy hand: (3:6)     <br>In that day shall <i>he<\/i> swear, saying, I will not be a [physician] ;     <br>for in my <u>house<\/u> [there] is neither bread nor clothing: make me not a ruler of the people. (3:7)     <br>For <i>Jerusalem<\/i> is <u>ruined<\/u>,     <br>and <i>Judah<\/i> is <u>fallen<\/u>:     <br>because their[tongue[s] and their doings [have been] against the Lord,     <br>to provoke the eyes of his glory. (3:8)     <br>The <i>[show] of their countenance<\/i> <u>doth witness<\/u> against them;     <br>and [<u>doth] declare<\/u> their sin [to be even] as Sodom, [and <i>they cannot hide it<\/i>].     <br><i>Woe<\/i> unto <u>their soul<\/u>!     <br>for they have rewarded <i>evil<\/i> unto <u>themselves<\/u>. (3:9)     <br>Say [unto] the <i>righteous<\/i> that it [is] <u>well<\/u> with [them]:     <br>for <i>they<\/i> shall eat the <u>fruit<\/u> of their doings. (3:10)     <br>Woe unto the wicked! [for they shall perish];     <br>for the reward of his hands shall be given him. (3:11)     <br>[And] my people, <i>children<\/i> are <u>their oppressors<\/u>,     <br>and <i>women<\/i> <u>rule over them<\/u>.     <br>O my people, they [who] <i>lead thee<\/i> <u>cause thee to err<\/u>,     <br>and <u>destroy the way<\/u> of <i>thy paths.<\/i> (3:12)<\/blockquote> ",
