    "html": "<p> But Israel has no such works; on the contrary, its history has been a string of sins from the very first. <em> \u201cThy first forefather sinned, and thy mediators have fallen away from me.\u201d<\/em> By the first forefather, Hitzig, Umbreit, and Knobel understand Adam; but Adam was the forefather of the human race, not of Israel; and the debt of Adam was the debt of mankind, and not of Israel. The reference is to Abraham, as the first of the three from whom the origin and election of Israel were dated; Abraham, whom Israel from the very first had called with pride \u201cour father\u201d (<a class=\"ref\">Matthew 3:9<\/a>). Even the history of Abraham was stained with sin, and did not shine in the light of meritorious works, but in that of grace, and of faith laying hold of grace. The <em> m e l\u0131\u0304ts\u0131\u0304m <\/em> , interpreters, and mediators generally (<a class=\"ref\">2 Chronicles 32:31; Job 33:23<\/a>), are the prophets and priests, who stood between Jehovah and Israel, and were the medium of intercourse between the two, both in word and deed. They also had for the most part become unfaithful to God, by resorting to ungodly soothsaying and false worship. Hence the sin of Israel was as old as its very earliest origin; and apostasy had spread even among those who ought to have been the best and most godly, because of the office they sustained.<\/p>",
