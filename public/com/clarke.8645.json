They are here challenged to produce the evidence of the power and foreknowledge of their idol gods; and the Jews are just afterwards, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NTE2XQ==\">Isaiah 43:10<\/a> , appealed to as witnesses for God in this cause, therefore these latter cannot here be meant by the people blind with eyes and deaf with ears.<\/p> ",
