In this chapter we have the invasion of Judah by Sennacherib, <\/i><a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MzMyXQ==\">Isaiah 36:1<\/a><i>. He sends Rabshakeh, who, by his blasphemous persuasion, tempts Hezekiah to despair, and the people to revolt, <\/i><a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODMzMyI6MjF9\">Isaiah 36:2-22<\/a><i>.<\/i><\/p>\n<p><a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MzMyXQ==\">Isaiah 36:1<\/a>.<i>Now it came to pass, <\/i>&c. \u2014 The history related in this and the three following chapters is contained, almost wholly in the same words, 2 Kings 18., 19., 20.; where see the notes. It was probably first written by this prophet, and from him taken into the second book of Kings to complete that history: and we may conjecture that it is that part of the account of Hezekiah\u2019s reign which is said to have been written by Isaiah, <a class=\"ref\">2 Chronicles 32:32<\/a>. It is inserted here, because it casts great light on several particulars of the foregoing prophecies; and chapter 39. contains a prophecy of the captivity, and is an introduction to the remainder of Isaiah\u2019s prophecies, a great part of which relate to the restoration of the Jews, and their return from Babylon to their own land. For the same reason, the history of the taking of Jerusalem by the Babylonians is annexed to Jeremiah\u2019s prophecies, because it helps to explain and confirm several passages in them. <\/p>",
