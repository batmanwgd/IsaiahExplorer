It is said in the former, that before any one was punished for a capital crime, proclamation was made before the prisoner by the public crier, in these words: <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05e2\u05dc\u05d9\u05d5 \u05d5\u05d9\u05dc\u05de\u05d3 \u05d9\u05d1\u05d0 \u05d6\u05db\u05d5\u05ea \u05dc\u05d5 \u05e9\u05d9\u05d5\u05d3\u05e2 \u05de\u05d9 \u05db\u05dc <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">col mi shioda lo zachoth yabo vayilmad alaiv<\/span>, \"whosoever knows any thing of this man's innocence, let him come and declare it. \"Tract. Sandhedrim. Surenhus. Part 4 p. 233. On which passage the Gemara of Babylon adds, that \"before the death of Jesus this proclamation was made for forty days; but no defense could be found.\" On which words Lardner observes: \"It is truly surprising to see such falsities, contrary to well-known facts.\" Testimonies, Vol. 1 p. 198. The report is certainly false; but this false report is founded on the supposition that there was such a custom, and so far confirms the account given from the Mishna. The Mishna was composed in the middle of the second century according to Prideaux; Lardner ascribes it to the year of Christ 180.<\/p>\n\n<p>Casaubon has a quotation from Maimonides which farther confirms this account: - Exercitat. in Baronii Annales, Art. lxxvi. Ann. 34. Numbers 119. Auctor est Maimonides in Perek 13 <i>ejus libri ex opere Jad, solitum fieri, ut cum reus, sententiam mortis passus, a loco judicii exibat ducendus ad supplicium, praecedoret ipsum<\/i> <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\ufffd, class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u03ba\u03b7\u03c1\u03c5\u03be<\/span> \u05d7\u05db\u05e8\u05d5\u05d6<span <=\"\" span=\"\">   <span class=\"translit\">dori<\/span>, 'my generation') from my youth, which was at the first among my own nation at Jerusalem, know all the Jews, who knew me from the beginning, if they would testify; that after the straitest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee;\"  <a class=\"ref\">Acts 26:4,  Acts 26:5<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d3\u05d5\u05e8 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">dor<\/span>  signifies age, duration, the time which one man or many together pass in this world, in this place; the course, tenor, or manner of life.

St. Germain de Prez.<\/p>\n\n<p>\"Origen, \"(Contra Celsum, lib. 1 p. 370, edit. 1733), after having quoted at large this prophecy concerning the Messiah, \"tells us, that having once made use of this passage in a dispute against some that were accounted wise among the Jews, one of them replied, that the words did not mean one man, but one people, the Jews, who were smitten of God and dispersed among the Gentiles for their conversion; that he then urged many parts of this prophecy to show the absurdity of this interpretation, and that he seemed to press them the hardest by this sentence, <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u03b1\u03c0\u03bf \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03b9\u03c9\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03bb\u03b1\u03bf\u03c5 \u03bc\u03bf\u03bd \u03b7\u03c7\u03b8\u03b7 \u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u03b8\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd<\/span>, 'for the iniquity of my people was he smitten to death.'\" Now as Origen, the author of the Hexapla, must have understood Hebrew, we cannot suppose that he would have urged this last quotation as so decisive if the Greek Version had not agreed here with the Hebrew text; nor that these wise Jews would have been at all distressed by this quotation, unless their Hebrew text had read agreeably to <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u03b8\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd<\/span>, \"to death,\" on which the argument principally depended; for, by quoting it immediately, they would have triumphed over him, and reprobated his Greek version. This, whenever they could do it, was their constant practice in their disputes with the Christians. Jerome, in his Preface to the Psalms, says, <i>Nuper cum Hebraeo disputans, quaedam pro Domino Salvatore de Psalmis testimonia protulisti: volensque ille te illudere, per sermones fere singulos asserebat, non ita haberi in Hebraeo, ut tu de<\/i> lxx. <i>opponebas<\/i>. \"Lately disputing with a Hebrew, - thou advancedst certain passages out of the Psalms which bear testimony to the Lord the Savior; but he, to elude thy reasoning, asserted that almost all thy quotations have an import in the Hebrew text different from what they had in the Greek.\" And Origen himself, who laboriously compared the Hebrew text with the Septuagint, has recorded the necessity of arguing with the Jews from such passages only as were in the Septuagint agreeable to the Hebrew: <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u03b9\u0314\u03bd\u03b1 \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \u0399\u03bf\u03c5\u03b4\u03b1\u03b9\u03bf\u03b9\u03c2 \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03bb\u03b5\u03b3\u03bf\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9 \u03bc\u03b7 \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c6\u03b5\u03c1\u03c9\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b1 \u03bc\u03b7 \u03ba\u03b5\u03b9\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03b1 \u03b5\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf\u03b9\u03c2 \u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03c6\u03bf\u03b9\u03c2 \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd, \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b9\u0314\u03bd\u03b1 \u03c3\u03c5\u03b3\u03c7\u03c1\u03b7\u03c3\u03c9\u03bc\u03b5\u03b8\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c6\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1<\/span> ' <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u03b5\u03ba\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9\u03c2<\/span> . See Epist. ad African. p. 15, 17. Wherefore as Origen had carefully compared the Greek version of the Septuagint with the Hebrew text, and speaks of the contempt with which the Jews treated all appeals to the Greek version where it differed from their Hebrew text; and as he puzzled and confounded the learned Jews by urging upon them the reading <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u03b8\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd<\/span>, \"unto death,\" in this place; it seems almost impossible not to conclude, both from Origen's argument and the silence of his Jewish adversaries, that the Hebrew text at that time actually had <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05dc\u05de\u05d5\u05ea <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">lemaveth<\/span>, \"to death,\" agreeably to the version of the Septuagint. - Dr. Kennicott.<\/p>",
