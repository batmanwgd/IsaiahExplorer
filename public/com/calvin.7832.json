He bids her be of good cheer, and next assigns the reason; that the issue of her troubles will be such that she \u201cshall not be ashamed;\u201d as if he had said, \u201cAlthough for a time thou art wretched, yet thy affairs shall be prosperous;\u201d and as it is elsewhere said, \u201cThey who hope in the Lord shall not be ashamed.\u201d (<a class=\"ref\">Psalms 25:3<\/a>) <\/p> \n <p> <i>Blush not; <\/i> that is, \u201ccherish good hope, and be confident.\u201d Those men \u201cblush\u201d who are ashamed, and who, being disappointed of their hope, suffer their hearts to be cast down. He next assigns the same reason, \u201cfor thou shalt not be exposed to shame.\u201d I consider that here, as formerly, <span class=\"greek-hebrew\"> \u05db\u05d9 <\/span> <i>(ki) <\/i> signifies <i>for; <\/i> and therefore the same sentence is twice repeated under a variety of expressions, except that the former clause may relate to the disposition of the heart, and the latter to the external cause. But the more simple meaning of both clauses is, that it is a promise of success and prosperity, as if he had said that the calamity shall be brought to an end. <\/p> \n <p> <i>Yea, thou shalt forget the shame of thy youth. <\/i> This is a confirmation of the former clause. He means the calamities which befell the Church while she was still young, and the remembrance of which will be wholly obliterated by the prosperity which she shall afterwards enjoy. We mentioned a little before, that <i>widowhood <\/i> is a term used in regard to her, because God had forsaken, and, so to speak, had divorced her. <\/p> ",
