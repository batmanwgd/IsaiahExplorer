He had no \u201csepulchre of his fathers\u201d to deck with fresh stateliness, and, like the kings and great ones of the earth (the kings of Sidon, the Pharaohs of Egypt, the kings of Assyria), had built one for himself, hollowed out of the wells (probably on one of the hills of Jerusalem), to be his own everlasting \u201chabitation,\u201d his domus \u0153terna. So in <a class=\"ref\">Ecclesiastes 12:5<\/a>, the grave is the \u201clong home\u201d of man. Rock-hewn sepulchres of this type are found on the slopes of all the hills in the neighbourhood of the holy city. <\/p>",
