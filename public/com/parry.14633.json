    "html": " <p>This prophecy speaks to us in our day. The gathering of Israel, temples, and temple service are the principal themes in this section; we will \"flow\" upwards to the temple mountain, learn of God's ways (in the temple), and walk in God's paths (in the temple). In addition, temple service and worship (2:2-3) are directly connected to worldwide peace and prosperity (2:4); that is, temple attendance (2:2) results in peace (2:4), a desire to learn of God (2:3), and a willingness to walk in his light (2:5). Micah presents the same prophecy in his writings (<a class=\"ref\">Micah 4:1-3<\/a>). <\/p> <p>Joseph Smith summed up the connection between the gathering of Israel and temple service: \"The object of gathering the Jews, or the people of God in any age of the world&hellip;was to build unto the Lord a house whereby He could reveal unto His people the ordinances of His house and the glories of His kingdom, and teach the people the way of salvation.\" <\/p> <blockquote>The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem. And it shall come to pass in the last days, [when] the mountain of the Lord's house (2:1-2a)     <br>shall be <i>established<\/i> in the top of the <u>mountains<\/u>,     <br>and shall be <i>exalted<\/i> above the <u>hills<\/u>;     <br>and all <i>nations<\/i> <u>shall flow<\/u> unto it. (2:2b)     <br>And many <i>people<\/i> <u>shall go<\/u> and say,     <br><i>Come<\/i> <u>ye<\/u>,     <br>and let <u>us<\/u> <i>go<\/i> up     <br>to the <i>mountain<\/i> of the <u>Lord<\/u>,     <br>to the <i>house<\/i> of the <u>God of Jacob <\/u>;     <br>and he will <i>teach us<\/i> of <u>his ways<\/u>,     <br>and <i>we will walk<\/i> in <u>his paths<\/u>:     <br>for <i>out of Zion<\/i> shall go forth the <u>law<\/u>,     <br>and the <u>word<\/u> of the Lord <i>from Jerusalem.<\/i> (2:3)     <br>And he shall <i>judge<\/i> among the <u>nations<\/u>,     <br>and shall <i>[settle the case] for many <u>people<\/u>:<\/i>     <br>and they shall beat <i>their swords<\/i> into <u>plowshares<\/u>,     <br>and <i>their spears<\/i> into <u>pruninghooks<\/u>:     <br><i>nation<\/i> shall not lift up <u>sword<\/u> against <i>nation,<\/i>     <br>neither shall <i>they<\/i> learn <u>war<\/u> any more.
