    "html": "<p>As seen in the previous prophecy to Moab, which also contained promises to Judah, Isaiah often weaves prophecies to the house of Israel into his discourses to foreign nations. Thus, it is not surprising that his pronouncement concerning Damascus (the capital of Syria) also includes warnings to Israel as well. His words to the Gentiles are not just a witness to them, but also contain warnings and promises concerning their relationship with Israel.<\/p> <p>To those Israelites who live east of the Jordan Valley with Syria on the north and Moab to the south, Isaiah's words to their neighbors are obviously of some consequence, though they probably did not want to hear his warnings to them. His pronouncement to Syria and the eastern Israelites can be easily divided into five parts:<\/p> <blockquote><p><sup>1<\/sup> Syria (the ancient rival of Israel) will be emptied (vs. 1-3).<\/p> <p><sup>2<\/sup> Israel will dwindle (4-6).<\/p> <p><sup>3<\/sup> The people will eventually turn to God (7, 8).<\/p> <p><sup>4<\/sup> Harvests will cease (9-11).<\/p> <p><sup>5<\/sup> Those who threaten God's children will be suddenly destroyed (12-14).<\/p> <\/blockquote><p>These five elements are in a clear chiastic pattern that spans the entire chapter. It will simply be highlighted in the right-hand column as the applicable verses are quoted.<\/p>",
