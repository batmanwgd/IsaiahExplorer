And Sennacherib invaded the country in his fourteenth year; and, after his defeat and departure, God promised and added to him fifteen years more, <a class=\"ref\">2 Kings 20:6<\/a>. <i>For the vintage shall fail <\/i>\u2014During the time of the Assyrian invasion. <i>The <\/i> <i>gathering shall not come <\/i>\u2014Namely, of the other fruits of the earth; as that feast which was observed after the gathering of all the fruits was called <i>the feast of ingathering,<\/i>, <a class=\"ref\">Exodus 23:16<\/a>. <i>Tremble, ye women,<\/i>,&c.\u2014It seems probable, from these repeated addresses to the women, that those of Jerusalem especially, and, perhaps, also of many of the other towns in Judea, were, at that time, peculiarly vain, luxurious, dissipated, and wanton, and regardless of all religion. The prophet, therefore, especially addresses them, and warns them that a time of trouble awaited them. <i>Strip ye and make ye bare <\/i>\u2014Put off your ornaments, as God commanded upon a like occasion, (<a class=\"ref\">Exodus 33:5<\/a>,) that you may put on sackcloth instead of them, as mourners and penitents used to do. <i>They shall lament for the teats <\/i>\u2014For the pleasant and fruitful fields which, like teats, yielded you plentiful and excellent nourishment. <\/p>",
