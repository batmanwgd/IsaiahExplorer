Yet even in the earliest days of Israel as a nation, some resented the Sabbath's interruption of their merchandising and worldly pursuits (<a class=\"ref\">Amos 8:5<\/a>). Here the Lord challenges his people to do his will on the Sabbath, not their own.<\/p> <p><i>speaking thine own words.<\/i> This phrase means speaking idle words. The words we use in our lives matter, and the words we use on the Sabbath should reflect the sanctity of the day.<\/p> ",
