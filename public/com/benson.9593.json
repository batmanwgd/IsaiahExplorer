    "html": "<p><a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 65:5-6<\/a>.<i>Who say, Stand by thyself, come not near to me <\/i>\u2014 Though they were so exceedingly guilty, yet they pretended to singular sanctity, so that they would not suffer others to come near or touch them. The reader will observe that the crime of hypocrisy is here decried, and every one that is acquainted with the gospels will easily see that the character of the Pharisees and their followers is drawn in this passage; see <a class=\"ref\">Luke 18:10<\/a>. And there cannot be a more lively description of spiritual pride and hypocritical arrogance than it gives us. <i>For I am holier than thou <\/i>\u2014 Thus they esteemed themselves <i>holier <\/i>than others, though all their <i>holiness <\/i>lay in rituals, and those too such as God never commanded. Of these God saith, <i>These are a smoke in my nostrils, a fire that burneth all the day <\/i>\u2014<\/p>\n<p>That is, a continual provocation to me: as <i>smoke <\/i>is an <i>offence <\/i>to our <i>noses.<\/i> <i>Behold, it is written before me <\/i>\u2014 They may think I take no notice of these things, but I will as certainly remember them as princes remember the things which, in order that they may not forget them, they record in writing. And they shall know that I take notice of, and will remember them; for <i>I will not keep silence <\/i>\u2014 That is, I will not long neglect the punishment of them, though for a while I have delayed it, like a man who restrains his wrath, for some wise reasons which are best known to himself, <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 50:21<\/a>; <i>but will recompense into their bosom <\/i>\u2014 My punishment of them shall be severe and certain, but yet it shall be just, and not greater than their sins have merited.<\/p>",
