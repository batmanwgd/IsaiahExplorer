    "html": "<p>With this chapter, the earliest Isaiah chapter to be quoted, Nephi begins the longest uninterrupted recitation of Isaiah's writings in the Book of Mormon. Thirteen consecutive chapters of the Old Testament seer are quoted. Nevertheless, the Nephite version shows many modifications in the text. As noted earlier, these differences are shown by <i>italics <\/i> or <u>underlining<\/u>.<\/p>     <p>On the surface, some differences appear to be minimal; yet they are significant. For example, the time frame in which these prophecies will be fulfilled is identified (the last days) by the insertion of the following words: \"when\" (vs. 2); \"soon cometh\" (vs. 12); and \"the day of the Lord shall come\" (vs. 13).<\/p>     <p>The Nephite prophets copied Isaiah's writings from the plates of brass in their possession. Among other things, these plates contained \"the prophecies of the holy prophets, from the beginning, even down to the commencement of the reign of [King] Zedekiah.\" (See <a class=\"ref\">1 Nephi 5:11-14<\/a>.) The addition of the phrase \"And upon all the ships of the sea\" in verse 16 of <a class=\"ref\">2 Nephi 12<\/a> is a testimony to the fact that the Isaiah text in the Book of Mormon came from a source other than the King James Bible. The addition is consistent with the text in the early Greek version of the Old Testament, or the Septuagint. (See footnote 16<i>a<\/i> of <a class=\"ref\">2 Nephi 12<\/a>.) Other examples might be cited as well. (See GAWI, 33; IPSP, 90-91.)<\/p>     <p>Chapter 2 of Isaiah begins with a vision of some events that will precede and\/or occur during the millenium. It continues with a rebuke and a promise of judgement upon the rebellious. The possessions of the proud will be taken from them. Isaiah contrasts the ways of the wicked with those of the Lord. For example, the Lord's house, which is truly \"a house of prayer, a house of fasting, a house of faith, a house of learning... a house of God\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 109:8<\/a>), is \"established in the top of the mountains... exalted above the hills\" (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3Njg4XQ==\">Isaiah 2:2<\/a>). On the other hand, the wicked seek to hide in \"the tops of ragged rocks\" or the crevices of cliffs. Here they vainly hope that darkness will shield them from the piercing rebuke of the Lord.<\/p>",
