    "html": "<p><b>(<a class=\"ref\">2 Nephi 12:3<\/a>).<\/b><i>\"Out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.<\/i>\" Two world capitals will be established during the Millennium: Zion (the New Jerusalem) and (the old but restored) Jerusalem. (See BICQ, 161-62; 209-10.) From these two centers of strength, the world will be governed politically and spiritually. The city of Zion will be established on the North American continent, specifically in what is now Independence, Jackson County, Missouri. (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 57:1-3; Ether 13:6<\/a>; BICQ, 151-63.)<\/p>     <p>There have been other interpretations applied to the meaning of \"out of Zion shall go forth the law.\" For example, the Prophet Joseph Smith identified \"the whole of America [as] Zion.\" (TPJS, 362.) Keeping this in mind, consider the Lord's declaration that He \"established the Constitution of this land.\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 101:80<\/a>.) Part of the dedicatory prayer given by President George Albert Smith at the Idaho Falls Temple in 1945 stated: \"We thank thee that thou hast revealed to us that those who gave us our constitutional form of government were men wise in thy sight and that thou didst raise them up for the very purpose of putting forth that sacred document. \u2026 We pray that kings and rulers and the peoples of all nations under heaven may be persuaded \u2026 to adopt similar governmental systems, thus to fulfill the ancient prophecy of Isaiah [and Micah] that ' \u2026 out of Zion shall go forth the law.'\" (IE, Oct. 1945, p. 564.)<\/p>     <p> That there might be multiple interpretations of the prophecy is illustrated by statements of Elder Mark E. Petersen of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. He suggested that the counsel given at the general conferences of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was a fulfillment of the prophecy that \"out of Zion shall go forth the law.\" (WRL, pp. 200-201, 305-7.)<\/p>",
