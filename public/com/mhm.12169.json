The lot of the tribe of  Asher bordered upon it. See   <a class=\"ref\">Joshua 19:29<\/a>,  where it is called \"the strong city Tyre.\" We seldom find it a  dangerous enemy to Israel, but sometimes their faithful ally, as in the  reigns of David and Solomon  for trading cities maintain their  grandeur, not by the conquest of their neighbours, but by commerce with  them. In this chapter is foretold,  I. The lamentable desolation of Tyre, which was performed by  Nebuchadnezzar and the Chaldean army, about the time that they  destroyed Jerusalem  and a hard task they had of it, as appears   <a class=\"ref\">Ezekiel 29:18<\/a>,  where they are said to have \"served a hard service against Tyre,\" and  yet to have no wages,   <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 23:1-14<\/a>.  II. The restoration of Tyre after seventy years, and the return of the  Tyrians out of their captivity to their trade again,   ver. 15-18.<\/p>",
