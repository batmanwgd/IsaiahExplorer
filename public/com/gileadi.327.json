They come from a distant land beyond the horizon&mdash;Jehovah and the instruments of his wrath&mdash;to cause destruction throughout the earth&rdquo; ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzkxMSI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 13:4-5<\/a>; cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODc0LDE4MzcxXQ==\">10:23; 37:18<\/a>). Those who scoff only harden the bonds of their self-deception that hold them bound to unreality, thereby sealing upon themselves the very disaster they had hoped to evade ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODIzMCI6M30=\">Isaiah 30:12-14<\/a>).<\/p> ",
