The contrast presented by Paul is sup ported in verse 2 of the JST reading, which indicates that the Lord would send his servants to those not of Israel (the Gen tiles) because Israel had not walked after his ways. The roes sage, then, is that the gospel would be taken to the Gentiles, because Israel had not responded to the call.<\/p>     ",
