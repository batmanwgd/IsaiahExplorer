    "html": "<p>As Jehovah is humanity&rsquo;s only Savior, his people needn&rsquo;t look elsewhere for their salvation, no matter what constraints or threats they come under. Nations and rulers may concoct their own plans for their peoples but they will come to nought. From the first, Jehovah conceived and planned his people&rsquo;s salvation and their enemies&rsquo; damnation. As a proof of his divinity, he foretold his work of deliverance at the <em>hand<\/em> of his servant and of destruction at the <em>hand<\/em> of the archtyrant from of old (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3sic2luZ2xlcyI6WzE4MTIwLDE4Mzc5XX0seyIxODU0MSI6Mn0seyIxODU5NiI6NX1d\">Isaiah 25:1; 37:26; 44:7-8; 46:9-13<\/a>). Of these things, his people may gain a testimony and bear witness.<\/p><p><em>When there was no strange god among you.<\/em> If they would again become Jehovah&rsquo;s covenant people, they must give up the strange gods and false traditions they have inherited from the nations among who they are scattered. Such gods prove utterly useless: &ldquo;Who would fashion a god or cast an idol that cannot benefit them?&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTg1NDQ=\">Isaiah 44:10<\/a>). Those who &ldquo;who carried about their wooden idols and prayed to gods that could not save them&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTg1ODI=\">Isaiah 45:20<\/a>) must worship Jehovah, &ldquo;apart from [whom] there is no savior&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTg1NzM=\">v 11<\/a>). Instead of the traditions of their fathers it is <em>his<\/em> ways they must learn (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3Njg5LDE4NjMyXQ==\">Isaiah 2:3; 48:17<\/a>).<\/p>",
