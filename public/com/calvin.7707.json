So long as Babylon was in a flourishing condition, she preserved her reputation, and was highly honored; for wealth and power, like veils, often conceal a great number of sores, which, when the veils have been removed, become visible, and are beheld with the greatest disgrace. And, as Demosthenes says, when, speaking of Philip\u2019s condition, \u2014<span class=\"greek-hebrew\"> \u1f65\u03c3\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1 \u03b3\u1f70\u03c1 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fd6\u03c2 \u03c3\u1f7d\u03bc\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd \u1f21\u03bc\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f15\u03c9\u03c2 \u03bc\u1f72\u03bd \u1f02\u03bd \u1f10\u03c1\u03c1\u03c9\u03bc\u1f73\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f96 \u03c4\u03b9\u03c2 \u03bf\u1f50\u03b4\u1f72\u03bd \u1f10\u03c0\u03b1\u03b9\u03c3\u03b8\u1f71\u03bd\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03b8 \u1f15\u03ba\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1 \u03c3\u03b1\u03b8\u03c1\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f10\u03c0\u1fbf \u1f02\u03bd \u03b4\u1f72 \u1f00\u03c1\u03c1\u1f7d\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1 \u03c3\u03c5\u03bc\u03b2\u1f63 \u03c0\u1f71\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1 \u03ba\u03b9\u03bd\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u03ba\u1f02\u03bd \u1fe5\u03b7\u0311\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1 \u03ba\u1f02\u03bd \u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u1f73\u03bc\u03bc\u03b1 \u03ba\u1f02\u03bd \u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u1f79 \u03c4\u03b9 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f51\u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u1f79\u03bd\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03c3\u03b1\u03b8\u03c1\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f96 \u03bf\u1f55\u03c4\u03c9 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u03c0\u1f79\u03bb\u03b5\u03c9\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u03c4\u03c5\u03c1\u1f71\u03bd\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd. <\/span> \u201cFor as, in our bodies, so long as any person is in full vigor, no malady is perceived in any of the members, but if he fall into debility, produced either by a wound or by a strain, or by any other of the diseases to which the body is subject, the whole is affected; so is it with cities and governments.\u201d (Dem., Olynth. 2.) When commotions arise, and when their wealth and troops are taken from them, disgraceful transactions which lay concealed are exposed to view; for cruelty, and fraud, and extortions, and perjury, and unjust oppressions, and other crimes, which were honored during prosperity, being to fall into disgrace.<\/p> \n<p><i>I will take vengeance, and will not meet (thee) a man. <\/i> Some think that<span class=\"greek-hebrew\"> \u05db<\/span><i>(caph)<\/i> ought here to be supplied, \u201c<i>As<\/i> a man;\u201d as if he had said, \u201cDo not think that ye have to deal with man, whose attack ye may be able to resist.\u201d And, indeed, in other passages, when he speaks of the hand of man, it denotes some abatement; but here he means that no remedy is left, because God will reduce them to nothing. Others translate it, \u201cI will not meet a man;\u201d that is, \u201cI will not allow a man to meet me; whoever shall meet me, or intercede in their behalf, I will not spare them, or remit or abate their punishment.\u201d This meaning is highly appropriate, but the construction is somewhat forced; for<span class=\"greek-hebrew\"> \u05d0\u05e4\u05d2\u05e2<\/span><i>(ephgang)<\/i> must thus be understood to have a passive sense, which could scarcely be admitted. Besides, the Prophet does not absolutely say that no petition shall be presented to God, but that he cannot be appeased. The former exposition, therefore, flows more smoothly, so far as relates to the context; but let every one choose that which he prefers; for, whatever exposition you adopt, the words amount to this, \u201cthat the Lord will destroy the Babylonians, and that there will be no room for mercy.\u201d Only, I say, that I prefer the former, because it is more agreeable to the original text.<\/p> ",
