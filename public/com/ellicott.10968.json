The \u201cdoleful creatures\u201d (literally groaners) are probably \u201chorned owls;\u201d while the word rendered \u201cowls (literally, daughters of screaming) may be taken as ostriches (<a class=\"ref\">Job 39:13-18<\/a>). In the \u201csatyrs\u201d (literally, hairy or shaggy ones) we may find either \u201cgoats (as in <a class=\"ref\">Leviticus 4:24; Leviticus 16:9<\/a>), or, as the English version suggests, a mythical form of grotesque animal life (the \u201cdemons\u201d or \u201cdevils\u201d of <a class=\"ref\">Leviticus 17:7; 2 Chronicles 11:15<\/a>, a goat-shaped form, like that of the Greek Pan), or more probably (with Tristram), the species of baboon (Macacus Arabicus) still found in Babylonia. <\/p>",
