    "html": "<p> (10) Moab shall be trodden down . . .\u2014There seems at first something like a descent from the great apocalypse of a triumph over death and sin and sorrow, to a name associated with the local victories or defeats of a remote period in the history of Israel. The inscription of the Moabite stone, in connection with Isaiah 15, helps to explain the nature of the allusion. Moab had been prominent among the enemies of Israel; the claims of Chemosh, the god of Moab, had been set up against those of Jehovah, the God of Israel (Records of the Past, xi. 166), and so the name had become representative of His enemies. There was a mystical Moab, as there was afterwards a mystical Babylon, and in Rabbinic writings a mystical Edom (i.e., Rome). The proud nation was to lie wallowing in the mire of shame, trampled on by its s on the threshing-floor is trampled by the oxen till it looks like a heap of dung. In the Hebrew word for \u201cdunghill\u201d (madm\u00e7nah) we may probably trace a reference to the Moabite city of that name (<a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 48:2<\/a>), in which Isaiah sees an unconscious prophecy of the future condition of the whole nation.<\/p> ",
