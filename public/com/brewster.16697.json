This leadership, of course, should have been exercised through the priesthood, as shown by the Prophet Joseph Smith in commenting upon the dominion given to Adam (see TPJS, p. 157). For 'babes' (or 'children,' if the word does not refer to the Gentiles) to rule over Judah, they would rule without the priesthood.\" (GAWI, 34 35.) (Also see the commentary in the preceding paragraph.)<\/p>",
