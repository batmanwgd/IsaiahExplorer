These prophecies also apply to transgressors of any age who \"destroy\" and \"deal treacherously.\" The Lord destroyed Sennacherib and his armies and will continue to destroy all others who follow Sennacherib's pattern of evil.<\/p> <blockquote>Woe to thee that [<i>destroy<\/i>], and thou <u>wast not [destroyed<\/u>];     <br>and <i>dealest treacherously,<\/i> and they <u>dealt not treacherously<\/u> with thee!     <br>when thou shalt <i>cease [destroying],<\/i>     <br>thou shalt <u>be [destroyed<\/u>];     <br>and when thou shalt <i>make an end to deal treacherously,<\/i>     <br>they shall <u>deal treacherously<\/u> with thee.
