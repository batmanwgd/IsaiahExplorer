    "html": "<p>Like the conquering heroes of Mesopotamian mythology, the king of Assyria boasts of cutting down the cedars of Lebanon. As noted, while &ldquo;Lebanon&rdquo; represents Jehovah&rsquo;s elite people in the writings of the prophets (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 37:24<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 22:23; Ezekiel 17:3<\/a>), synonymous parallels identify &ldquo;mountains&rdquo; as nations or kingdoms (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 13:4; 64:1-3<\/a>), &ldquo;forests&rdquo; as cities (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 32:19<\/a>), and &ldquo;cedars&rdquo; and other trees as people (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 14:8; 61:3<\/a>). Isaiah further compares the king of Assyria\/Babylon to an <em>axe<\/em> and <em>saw<\/em> that hews down the wicked (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 10:15; 14:3-8<\/a>), signifying his primary function as a power of chaos.<\/p><p>These are things Isaiah had foretold: &ldquo;Jehovah of Hosts has a day in store for all the proud and arrogant and for all who are exalted, that they may be brought low. [It shall come] against all the lofty cedars of Lebanon that lift themselves up high, and against all the oaks of Bashan, against all high mountains and elevated hills&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 2:12-14<\/a>); &ldquo;Then will my Lord, Jehovah of Hosts, shatter the towering [trees] with terrifying power; the high in stature shall be hewn down, the lofty ones leveled. The dense forests will be battered down with [the force of] iron, and Lebanon fall spectacularly&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 10:33-34<\/a>).<\/p>",
