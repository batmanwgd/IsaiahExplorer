If the supposition be correct, that this and the following chapter contain a summing up of all that the prophet had thus far uttered; a declaration that all the enemies of the people of God would be destroyed&mdash;the most violent and bitter of whom was Idumea; and that this was to be succeeded by the happy times of the Messiah, then we see a plain reason why all the nations are summoned to hear and attend. The events pertain to them all; the truths communicated are of universal interest. &ldquo;And all that is therein.&rdquo; Hebrew as in Margin, &lsquo;fulness thereof;&rsquo; that is, all the inhabitants of the earth.<\/p><p><em>All things that come forth of it<\/em> &mdash;All that proceed from it; that is, all the inhabitants that the world has produced.
