    "html": "<p> (20) Shall the Lord shave with a razor that is hired.\u2014Better, \u201cwith the razor.\u201d The words find a parallel in the \u201cmade him naked\u201d of<a class=\"ref\">2 Chronicles 28:19<\/a> . The term \u201chired\u201d applies to the tribute which Ahaz was about to pay to Tilgath-pilneser. He thought that he was securing an ally: he was but hiring a razor (there is, perhaps, the implied thought that the razor is in other hands than his) that should sweep away all the signs of strength, and leave him an open shame and scorn to all who looked on him. (<a class=\"ref\">2 Samuel 10:4<\/a>). From head to foot, not sparing even the beard, to maltreat which was the last extreme of Oriental outrage, he and his kingdom should be laid bare and naked to his enemies. Possibly there may be an allusive reference (Kay) to<a class=\"ref\">Leviticus 14:9<\/a> . The nation, leprous in its guilt (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NjYxXQ==\">Isaiah 1:6<\/a>), needs the treatment which was prescribed for the leper.<\/p> \n<p>() A man shall nourish a young cow, and two sheep . . .\u2014Better, two ewes. Not only should cultivation cease, but the flocks and herds that had before been counted by hundreds or thousands should be counted now by units, two ewes and a heifer for a man\u2019s whole stock, and yet (we note the prophet\u2019s irony once more in the use of the word \u201cabundance\u201d) even that should be enough for a population reduced in proportion. There should be \u201cmilk and honey\u201d for the scattered remnant. They should have that, and nothing but that, to eat, ad nauseam usque. The words are grouped together with a grim irony as reminding men of the proverbial words of praise which spoke of Canaan as \u201ca land of milk and honey\u201d (<a class=\"ref\">Exodus 3:17<\/a>).<\/p> ",
