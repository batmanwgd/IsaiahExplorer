See a similar use of the word &lsquo;hear&rsquo; in <a class=\"ref\">Exodus 2:24; Exodus 3:7<\/a>. <\/p> <p> <em>To reproach the living God <\/em>&mdash;The revilings of Rabsbakeh were really directed against the true God. The reproach of the &lsquo;living God&rsquo; consisted in comparing him to idols, and saying that be was no more able to deleted Jerusalem than the idol-gods had been able to defend their lands (see the note at <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MzQ5XQ==\">Isaiah 36:18<\/a>). The phrase &lsquo;the living God&rsquo; is often applied to Yahweh in contradistinction from idols, which were mere blocks of wood or stone. <\/p> <p> <em>For the remnant that is left <\/em>&mdash;For those who survive; or probably for those parts of the land, including Jerusalem, that have not fallen into the hands of the Assyrian. Sennacherib had taken many towns, but there were many also that had not yet been subdued by him. <\/p> ",
