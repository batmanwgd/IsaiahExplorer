I will severely punish and utterly destroy all who reject that stone. For <i>the line <\/i> and <i>plummet, <\/i> or <i>the plumb-line, <\/i> was not only used in erecting buildings, but also in pulling them down; those parts of the building being thus marked out which were to be demolished. <i>And the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, <\/i> &c.\u2014My judgments (which in the Scriptures are compared to a storm of hail or rain) shall discover the vanity of all your crafty and wicked devices, and shall sweep you away with the besom of destruction in spite of them. <\/p> ",
