These things imply (1) that the spirits of the departed in Hell maintain, or seek to maintain, a kind of anti-hierarchy; (2) that many leaders of nations end up in a lower world for having ruled their peoples unrighteously; (3) that the spirits of those who depart this world are apprised of the imminent arrival of people from this world who die; and (4) that, unlike the righteous, the wicked are rendered powerless in the end. <\/p> ",
