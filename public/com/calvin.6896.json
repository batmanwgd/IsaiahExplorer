    "html": " <p> <i>Their arrows will be sharp. <\/i>,He means that they will be provided with necessary weapons. The custom alluded to is that which existed among the Assyrians and other eastern nations, who frequently made use of bows and arrows in battle, as Englishmen of the present day enter into the battlefield with a loaded quiver. Under this class he includes every kind of weapons of war. But as the way was long, and the journey difficult, the Jew might think that many things would occur to interrupt the march of the enemy. He therefore says, that <i>the hoofs of the horses will be like flint <\/i>,; by which he means that they will suffer no molestation, and will at length arrive in Judea without weariness. For a similar reason he compares <i>their wheels to a whirlwind <\/i>,. The ancients were wont to employ chariots in going to war, and therefore he mentions not only <i>horses <\/i>,, but <i>wheels <\/i>,. All these circumstances must be understood to relate to the haste and rapidity with which they would proceed; or, in other words, that no length of journey would prevent the Lord from carrying forward the enemies without delay for the destruction of the Jews. <\/p>,",
