Isaiah&rsquo;s satire on idolaters in this passage shows the futility of creating substitutes for humanity&rsquo;s Creator. As these false gods are the antithesis of the true God, they are the main reason people become spiritually blind and lose understanding of him (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgxNjEiOjN9LHsiMTg1NDMiOjEyfV0=\">Isaiah 27:9-11; 44:9-20<\/a>). Such gods can&rsquo;t save them in Jehovah&rsquo;s Day of Judgment (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg1ODIiOjF9LHsiMTg1ODgiOjh9XQ==\">Isaiah 45:20; 46:1-8<\/a>). If the nations themselves are but chaos (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg1NzciOjN9XQ==\">vv 15-17<\/a>), then how much more so the images and idols they invent?<\/p>",
