    "html": "<p>President Spencer W. Kimball said:<\/p><p>&ldquo;The term<em>priest<\/em> is here used to denote all religious leaders of any faith. Isaiah said: &lsquo;The earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof; because they have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance, broken the everlasting covenant.&rsquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTAxXQ==\">Isa. 24:5<\/a> .) From among the discordant voices we are shocked at those of many priests who encourage the defilement of men and wink at the eroding trends and who deny the omniscience of God. Certainly these men should be holding firm, yet some yield to popular clamor.<\/p><p>&ldquo;I give some quotes from the press:<\/p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Many churchmen are reluctant to give a definite yes or no to marijuana.&rsquo; &lsquo;It depends upon circumstances.&rsquo; (<em>Time,<\/em> August 16, 1968.)<\/p><p>&ldquo;They have developed &lsquo;situation ethics,&rsquo; which seem to cover all sins.<\/p><p>&ldquo;Other religious leaders are saying: &lsquo;&hellip; precise rules of Christian conduct should not necessarily apply to problems of sexuality.&rsquo; (London&mdash;British Council of Churches.)<\/p><p>&ldquo;In contrast hear the strong voice of a prophet. Peter prophesied:<\/p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them. &hellip;<\/p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And many shall follow their pernicious ways. &hellip;&rsquo; (<a class=\"ref\">2 Pet. 2:1&ndash;2<\/a> .)&rdquo; (In Conference Report, Apr. 1971, p. 9.)<\/p><p class=\"cite\"> LDS Church Educational System Old Testament Student Manual, 1 Kings&ndash;Malachi, Religion 302, Chapter 15, Item 3<\/p> ",
