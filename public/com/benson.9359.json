Or, according to others, the prophet describes in these verses the vain and fruitless attempt of idolaters to hinder the effect of Cyrus\u2019s appearance, namely, the demolition of Babylon and its idols. \u201cThe passage maybe also fitly applied to the heathen powers combining together to support idolatry, and suppress the Christian religion.\u201d<\/p> ",
