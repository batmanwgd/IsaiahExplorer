Not only are they like those who are blind, but even worse, it is as if they have no eyes at all. As a consequence, night and noon are the same to them; spiritual brightness and darkness are indistinguishable to those who have no spiritual eyes. This is the fulfillment of a curse pronounced on the wicked by the Lord in Deuteronomy (Deut. 28:28-29). The Lord has power to heal this blindness, if we will repent and return unto him.<\/p> <p><i>in desolate places as dead men.<\/i> Israel has become spiritually dead, lost in a desolate world without God.<\/p> ",
