Acts of extortion or exploitation by Jehovah&rsquo;s alienated people mark them as hypocrites and render their sacrifices unacceptable (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc2NjYiOjV9XQ==\">Isaiah 1:11-15<\/a>). The &ldquo;sure reward&rdquo; Jehovah appoints his servants who live amidst their persecutors&rsquo; fa&ccedil;ade of righteousness consists of an &ldquo;eternal covenant&rdquo;&mdash;his &ldquo;loving fidelity toward David&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg3NDQiOjF9XQ==\">Isaiah 55:3<\/a>)&mdash;the unconditional covenant an emperor makes with his vassals who prove loyal under all conditions.<\/p><p>Not only those for whom Jehovah&rsquo;s servants function as proxy saviors under the Davidic Covenant but also their own descendants are blessed of God because of their parents&rsquo; righteousness: &ldquo;The lifetime of my people shall be as the lifetime of a tree; my chosen ones shall outlast the work of their hands. They shall not exert themselves in vain, or bear children doomed for calamity. For they are of the lineage of those Jehovah has blessed, and their posterity with them&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg5MjAiOjJ9XQ==\">Isaiah 65:22-23<\/a>). In them is Jehovah&rsquo;s blessing of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob fulfilled (<a class=\"ref\">Genesis 17:1-8; 22:16-18; 26:1-4; 35:9-12<\/a>).<\/p>",
