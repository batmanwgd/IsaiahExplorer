We may well boast of him, for there is no god like him. <i>We have waited for <\/i><i>him <\/i>\u2014 To appear in flesh; have waited for the coming of our Messiah, or Saviour, long since promised, and have waited a long time; and now at last he is come into the world, bringing salvation with him.<\/p>",
