Thus God, speaking after the manner of men, represents himself as feeling satisfaction in executing justice upon obstinate and incorrigible offenders. Compare <a class=\"ref\">Ezekiel 5:13; Ezekiel 16:42; Ezekiel 21:17<\/a>. But let it be observed, God is never said to take pleasure in the punishment of any, but those who have filled up the measure of their iniquities. <\/p> ",
