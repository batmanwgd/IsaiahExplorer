    "html": " <i>doors\/posts.<\/i> The New International Version translates, \"Behind your doors and your doorposts, you have put your pagan symbols.\" Israel has made their false god an integral element of their homes and their lives. This stands in contrast to the Lord's command that Israel keep the law of the Lord written on their doorposts (<a class=\"ref\">Deut. 11:20<\/a>) as a sign of dedication and for remembrance of the Lord.<\/p> <p><i>thy remembrance.<\/i> <i>Remembrance <\/i>means a memorial to an idol. The Jerusalem Bible identifies this as \"a domestic idol standing by the threshold or over the door.\" Their false god is an integral element of their lives.<\/p> <p> <i>discovered thyself\/gone up\/enlarged thy bed.<\/i> The New International Version renders this statement in painful plainness: \"Forsaking me, you uncovered your bed, you climbed into it and opened it wide; you made a pact with those whose beds you love, and you looked on their nakedness.\" This phrase has a literal meaning, referring to the pagan practices of temple prostitution, and also a symbolic meaning, referring to the unfaithfulness of Lady Israel (in our age, as well as anciently) in joining herself to other gods after making a covenant with Jehovah.<\/p> ",
