Under those circumstances, the lesser pay tribute to the greater so that thereby the lesser too may ascend to higher states of being. Upon the kingdom of God on the earth being organized into a hierarchy of spirits according to the heavenly pattern, peoples in lower categories serve those in upper ones who minister to them (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODA5Nl0seyIxODg1MCI6Mn1d\">Isaiah 23:18; 61:6-7 <\/a>). To deviate from that pattern is to invite covenant curses. <\/p> ",
