They would be so terrified and alarmed that they would have no courage, no hope, and no power to make resistance. They would abandon their plans of defense, and give themselves up to despair (compare <a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 50:43<\/a>: &lsquo;The king of Babylon hath heard the report of them, and his hands waxed feeble; anguish took hold of him, and pangs as of a Women in travail;&rsquo; <a class=\"ref\">Ezekiel 7:17; Zephaniah 3:16<\/a>). <\/p> <p>And every man&rsquo;s heart shall melt&mdash;Or, shall faint, so that he shall have no courage or strength (compare <a class=\"ref\">Deuteronomy 20:8<\/a>). The fact was, that the destruction of Babylon took place in the night. It came suddenly upon the city, while Belshazzar was at his impious feast; and the alarm was so unexpected and produced such consternation, that no defense was attempted (see <a class=\"ref\">Daniel 5:30<\/a>; compare the notes at <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NTYzXQ==\">Isaiah 45:1<\/a>). <\/p> ",
