    "title": "Warning of the Impending Assyrian Invasion",
    "html": "<p>The chapter is a continuation of the historical events introduced in chapter 7 (see Enrichment F). The prophet Isaiah is again to warn Judah against alliances, for, as he prophesies, they will be ineffective. The Messianic promise of Immanuel (&ldquo;God is with us&rdquo;) would prevail in their behalf. The Assyrian invasion would come, but Judah would still survive. Isaiah concluded his writing with a warning against the false teachings and practices that would pull Judah away from the law and testimony that had been revealed to them.<\/p><p class=\"cite\"> LDS Church Educational System Old Testament Student Manual, 1 Kings&ndash;Malachi, Religion 302, Chapter 13, Item 47<\/p> ",
