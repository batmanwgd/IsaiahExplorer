He calls them<i>the house of David,<\/i> to intimate that the following comfortable message was sent to Ahaz, not for his own sake, but only for the sake of his worthy progenitor David, to whom God had promised an everlasting kingdom. <i>Syria is confederate with Ephraim<\/i>\u2014With the kingdom of the ten tribes, commonly called<i>Ephraim,<\/i> because that tribe was by far the most numerous and potent of them. <i>And his heart was moved<\/i>\u2014Namely, the heart of Ahaz;<i>and the heart of his people<\/i>\u2014With excessive fear, arising partly from a consciousness of their own guilt, whereby they had put themselves out of God\u2019s protection; and partly from the consideration of the great strength and power of their enemies.<\/p> ",
