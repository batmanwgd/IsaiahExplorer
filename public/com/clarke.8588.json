Ludolphus, Comment. ad Hist. Aethiop. p. 206, says \"that in the Ethiopia language it signifies <i>clivus, locus editus <\/i>:\" and so the Syriac Version renders it in this place, <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05e2\u05e8\u05de\u05d0 <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, arama <\/span>: Hebrew, <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05e2\u05e8\u05de\u05d4 <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, aramah<\/span>, <i>tumulus, acervus<\/i>,. Thus the parallelism would be more perfect:\" the hilly country shall be made level, and the precipices a smooth plain.\" <\/p>",
