But there is one thing which we may learn even from a cursory inspection: namely, that the prophet was standing at the eventful boundary line between two distinct halves in the history of Israel. The people had not been brought to reflection and repentance either by the riches of the divine goodness, which they had enjoyed in the time of Uzziah-Jotham, the copy of the times of David and Solomon, or by the chastisements of divine wrath, by which wound after wound was inflicted. The divine methods of education were exhausted, and all that now remained for Jehovah to do was to let the nation in its existing state be dissolved in fire, and to create a new one from the remnant of gold that stood the fiery test. At this time, so pregnant with storms, the prophets were more active than at any other period. Amos appeared about the tenth year of Uzziah's reign, the twenty-fifth of Jeroboam II; Micah prophesied from the time of Jotham till the fall of Samaria, in the sixth year of Hezekiah's reign; but most prominent of all was Isaiah, the prophet <em> par excellence<\/em> , standing as he did midway between Moses and Christ. <\/p><p> In the consciousness of his exalted position in relation to the history of salvation, he commences his opening address in Deuteronomic style. Modern critics are of opinion, indeed, that Deuteronomy was not composed till the time of Josiah, or at any rate not earlier than Manasseh; and even Kahnis adduces this as a firmly established fact (see his <em> Dogmatik<\/em> , i. 277). But if this be the case, how comes it to pass, not only that Micah (<a class=\"ref\">Micah 6:8<\/a>) points back to a saying in <a class=\"ref\">Deuteronomy 10:12<\/a>, but that all the post-Mosaic prophecy, even the very earliest of all, is tinged with a Deuteronomic colouring. This surely confirms the self-attestation of the authorship of Moses, which is declared most distinctly in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MjYwXQ==\">Isaiah 31:9<\/a>. Deuteronomy was most peculiarly Moses' own law-book - his last will, as it were: it was also the oldest national book of Israel, and therefore the basis of all intercourse between the prophets and the nation. There is one portion of this peculiarly Mosaic <em> thorah<\/em> , however, which stands not only in a more truly primary relation to the prophecy of succeeding ages than any of the rest, but in a normative relation also. We refer to Moses' dying song, which has recently been expounded by Volck and Camphausen, and is called <em> shirath ha\u0302zinu <\/em> (song of \u201cGive ear\u201d), from the opening words in chapter 32. This song is a compendious outline or draft, and also the common key to all prophecy, and bears the same fundamental relation to it as the Decalogue to all other laws, and the Lord's Prayer to all other prayers. The lawgiver summed up the whole of the prophetic contents of his last words (Deut. 27-28, 29-30), and threw them into the form of a song, that they might be perpetuated in the memories and mouths of the people. This song sets before the nation its entire history to the end of time. That history divides itself into four great periods: the creation and rise of Israel; the ingratitude and apostasy of Israel; the consequent surrender of Israel to the power of the heathen; and finally, the restoration of Israel, sifted, but not destroyed, and the unanimity of all nations in the praise of Jehovah, who reveals Himself both in judgment and in mercy. This fourfold character is not only verified in every part of the history of Israel, but is also the seal of that history as a whole, even to its remotest end in New Testament times. In every age, therefore, this song has presented to Israel a mirror of its existing condition and future fate. And it was the task of the prophets to hold up this mirror to the people of their own times. This is what Isaiah does. He begins his prophetic address in the same form in which Moses begins his song. The opening words of Moses are: \u201cGive ear, O ye heavens, and I will speak; and let the earth hear the words of my mouth\u201d (<a class=\"ref\">Deuteronomy 32:1<\/a>). In what sense he invoked the heaven and the earth, he tells us himself in <a class=\"ref\">Deuteronomy 31:28-29<\/a>. He foresaw in spirit the future apostasy of Israel, and called heaven and earth, which would outlive his earthly life, that was now drawing to a close, as witnesses of what he had to say to his people, with such a prospect before them. Isaiah commences in the same way ( ), simply transposing the two parallel verbs \u201chear\u201d and \u201cgive ear:\u201d <em> \u201cHear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth; for Jehovah speaketh!\u201d<\/em> The reason for the appeal is couched in very general terms: they were to hear, because Jehovah was speaking. What Jehovah said coincided essentially with the words of Jehovah, which are introduced in <a class=\"ref\">Deuteronomy 32:20<\/a> with the expression \u201cAnd He said.\u201d What it was stated there that Jehovah would one day have to say in His wrath, He now said through the prophet, whose existing <em> present<\/em> corresponded to the coming <em> future<\/em> of the Mosaic ode. The time had now arrived for heaven and earth, which are always existing, and always the same, and which had accompanied Israel's history thus far in all places and at all times, to fulfil their duty as witnesses, according to the word of the lawgiver. And this was just the special, true, and ultimate sense in which they were called upon by the prophet, as they had previously been by Moses, to \u201chear.\u201d They had been present, and had taken part, when Jehovah gave the <em> thorah<\/em> to His people: the heavens, according to <a class=\"ref\">Deuteronomy 4:36<\/a>, as the place from which the voice of God came forth; and the earth, as the scene of His great fire. They were solemnly invoked when Jehovah gave His people the choice between blessing and cursing, life and death (<a class=\"ref\">Deuteronomy 30:19; Deuteronomy 4:26<\/a>). <\/p><p> And so now they are called upon to hear and join in bearing witness to all that Jehovah, their Creator, and the God of Israel, had to say, and the complaints that He had to make: <em> \u201cI have brought up children, and raised them high, and they have fallen away from me\u201d<\/em> ( ). Israel is referred to; but Israel is not specially named. On the contrary, the historical facts are generalized almost into a parable, in order that the appalling condition of things which is crying to heaven may be made all the more apparent. Israel was Jehovah's son (<a class=\"ref\">Exodus 4:22-23<\/a>). All the members of the nation were His children (<a class=\"ref\">Deuteronomy 14:1; Deuteronomy 32:20<\/a>). Jehovah was Israel's father, by whom it had been begotten (<a class=\"ref\">Deuteronomy 32:6, Deuteronomy 32:18<\/a>). The existence of Israel as a nation was secured indeed, like that of all other nations, by natural reproduction, and not by spiritual regeneration. But the primary ground of Israel's origin was the supernatural and mighty word of promise given to Abraham, in <a class=\"ref\">Genesis 17:15-16<\/a>; and it was by a series of manifestations of miraculous power and displays of divine grace, that the development of Israel, which dated from that starting-point, was brought up to the position it had reached at the time of the exodus from Egypt. It was in this sense that Israel had been begotten by Jehovah. And this relation between Jehovah and Israel, as His children, had now, at the time when Jehovah was speaking through the mouth of Isaiah, a long and gracious past behind it, viz., the period of Israel's childhood in Egypt; the period of its youth in the desert; and a period of growing manhood from Joshua to Samuel: so that Jehovah could say, \u201cI have brought up children, and raised them high.\u201d The <em> piel<\/em> (<em> giddel <\/em> ) used here signifies \u201cto make great;\u201d and when applied to children, as it is here and in other passages, such as <a class=\"ref\">2 Kings 10:6<\/a>, it means to bring up, to make great, so far as natural growth is concerned. The <em> pilel <\/em> (<em> romem <\/em> ), which corresponds to the <em> piel<\/em> in the so-called <em> verbis cavis <\/em> , and which is also used in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MDgyXQ==\">Isaiah 23:4<\/a> and <a class=\"ref\">Ezekiel 31:4<\/a> as the parallel to <em> giddel <\/em> , signifies to lift up, and is used in a \u201cdignified (dignitative) sense,\u201d with reference to the position of eminence, to which, step by step, a wise and loving father advances a child. The two vv. depict the state of Israel in the times of David and Solomon, as one of mature manhood and proud exaltation, which had to a certain extent returned under Uzziah and Jotham. But how base had been the return which it had made for all that it had received from God: <em> \u201cAnd they have fallen away from me.\u201d<\/em> We should have expected an adversative particle here; but instead of that, we have merely a <em> Vav cop. <\/em> , which is used energetically, as in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3Nzc3XQ==\">Isaiah 6:7<\/a> (cf., <a class=\"ref\">Hosea 7:13<\/a>). Two things which ought never to be coupled - Israel's filial relation to Jehovah, and Israel's base rebellion against Jehovah - had been realized in their most contradictory forms. The radical meaning of the verb is to break away, or break loose; and the object against which the act is directed is construed with <em> Beth<\/em> . The idea is that of dissolving connection with a person with violence and self-will; here it relates to that inward severance from God, and renunciation of Him, which preceded all outward acts of sin, and which not only had idolatry for its full and outward manifestation, but was truly idolatry in all its forms. From the time that Solomon gave himself up to the worship of idols, at the close of his reign, down to the days of Isaiah, idolatry had never entirely or permanently ceased to exist, even in public. In two different reformations the attempt had been made to suppress it, viz., in the one commenced by Asa and concluded by Jehoshaphat; and in the one carried out by Joash, during the lifetime of the high priest Jehoiada, his tutor and deliverer. But the first was not successful in suppressing it altogether; and what Joash removed, returned with double abominations as soon as Jehoiada was dead. Consequently the words, \u201cThey have rebelled against me,\u201d which sum up all the ingratitude of Israel in one word, and trace it to its root, apply to the whole history of Israel, from its culminating point under David and Solomon, down to the prophet's own time.<\/p>",
