Just as in Elijah\u2019s day (1 Kings 19:18), if many in the nation abandon the truth in the postexilic period, there will also be many who do not. God\u2019s promises to create himself a people will not return to him void (55:11). These are the ones God calls his \u201cservants.\u201d While the behavior that marks these as God\u2019s servants is not specified here, its content can be safely inferred. These are the people who \u201cseek\u201d the Lord (65:10).<\/p>     <p>\u2003What does seeking the Lord mean? This is the language of Deuteronomy. \u201cBut if from there you seek the <small>LORD<\/small> your God, you will find him if you look for him with all your heart and with all your soul\u201d (Deut. 4:29). To seek the Lord is to seek his ways, to seek to please him, to seek his presence. These are the primary goals of a believer, not his blessings. Moreover, seeking involves one\u2019s whole being. Ultimately, it is expressed in the language of Deuteronomy 6:5: \u201cLove the L<small>ORD<\/small> your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength.\u201d The servants of God stand in stark contrast with those who try to bypass a submissive relationship with God and seek to gain control of their \u201cdestiny\u201d through religious behavior (Isa. 65:11).<\/p>     ",
