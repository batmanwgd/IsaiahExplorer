We repeat history if we fail to pray sincerely and regularly and to worship at the temple.<\/p> <blockquote> But thou hast not <i>called upon me,<\/i> O <u> Jacob <\/u>;     <br>but thou hast <i>been weary of me,<\/i> O <u>Israel<\/u>. (43:22)     <br>Thou hast not <i>brought me<\/i> the small cattle of thy <u>burnt offerings<\/u>;     <br>neither hast thou <i>honored me<\/i> with thy <u>sacrifices<\/u>.     <br>I have not <i>caused thee<\/i> to serve with an <u>offering<\/u>,     <br>nor <i>wearied thee<\/i> with <u>incense<\/u>.
