When faced with tremendous challenges, including the approach of the Assyrian armies, he turned to the Lord in prayer and sought counsel from the Lord's prophet; then he trusted the Lord to deliver him and his people. So should we do when we are faced with trials, challenges, and threats to our lives. The Lord stands ready to help us\u2014but we must ask him and be obedient to his will if we hope to receive his blessing.<\/i><\/p> ",
