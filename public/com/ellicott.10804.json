    "html": "<p> (3) He that is left in Zion . . .\u2014The prophet turns from the Jerusalem that then was, with the hypocrisies and crimes of the men and the harlot fashions of its women, to the vision of a new Jerusalem, which shall realise the ideal of Psalms 15, 24. There every one should be called \u201choly\u201d (comp. <a class=\"ref\">1 Corinthians 1:2; 2 Corinthians 1:1<\/a>), and the name should be no unreal mockery ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MjY1XQ==\">Isaiah 32:5<\/a>), but should express the self-consecration and purity of its inhabitants.<\/p> \n<p>Every one that is written among the living.\u2014Literally, for life. The idea is that of \u201cthe book\u201d or \u201cregister\u201d of life in which are written the names of those who are worthy of living in the heavenly city. It meets us as early as <a class=\"ref\">Exodus 32:32<\/a> , and appears in <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 56:8; Psalms 69:28; Ezekiel 13:9.; Malachi 3:16; Daniel 12:1<\/a>; Acts xiii 48; <a class=\"ref\">Philippians 4:3; Revelation 3:5; Revelation 13:8; Revelation 21:27<\/a>. An examination of the passages, especially the first, will show that while it involves the idea of an election, it excludes that of an irreversible predestination, and that the election has to be \u201cmade sure\u201d by a life in harmony with it.
