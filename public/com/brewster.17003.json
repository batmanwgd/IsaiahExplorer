    "html": "<p><b>(<a class=\"ref\">2 Nephi 24:25<\/a>).<\/b>\"<i>I will <u>bring<\/u> the Assyrian in my land.<\/i>\" The Book of Mormon substitutes the word \"bring\" for the biblical or Hebrew word \"break.\" In either event, the invading Assyrian armies are foreseen by the Lord (brought into the land of Judah) but they will be broken or defeated. One renowned biblical commentary suggests that this was fulfilled in the defeat and destruction of the Assyrian King Sennacherib's army. (TOVBC, 426.) However, a Latter-day Saint scholar, with the advantage of additional revelation, states: \"It is difficult to determine whether Isaiah is prophesying about the destruction of Sennacherib's Assyrian army in 701 b.c. or the defeat of the army of the nations led by King Gog in the last days. (Compare <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isa. 36-37<\/a> with <a class=\"ref\">Ezek. 38-39<\/a>.) In both cases, the Lord's punishment is felt by the wicked nations of the earth.\" (IPSP, 189.)<\/p>",
