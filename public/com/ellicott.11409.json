They were to Israel, especially in the case of leprosy and other kindred diseases, what the priests of Asclepios were to Greece. The Divine promise guaranteed success to the use of natural remedies, but did not dispense with them, and they, like the spittle laid on the eyes of the blind in the Gospel miracles (<a class=\"ref\">Mark 7:33, John 9:6<\/a>), were also a help to the faith on which the miracle depended. Both this and the following verse seem, as has been said, to have been notes to <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 38:8<\/a>, supplied from the narrative of 2 Kings 20, and placed at the end of the chapter instead of at the foot of the page, as in modern MSS. or print. The word for \u201cboil\u201d appears in connection with leprosy in <a class=\"ref\">Exodus 9:9, Leviticus 13:18<\/a>, but is used generically for any kind of abscess, carbuncle, and the like.
