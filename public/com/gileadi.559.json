As there are essentially two ways&mdash;one good and one evil (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 1:16-17; 7:15-16; 65:2<\/a>)&mdash;his people should choose the good and enjoy the blessings of his covenant. If not, covenant curses accrue. Jehovah&rsquo;s titles&mdash;&ldquo;Holy One of Israel,&rdquo; &ldquo;your Redeemer,&rdquo; and &ldquo;your God&rdquo;&mdash;convey the idea of his unchanging fidelity that is grounded in his divine benevolence, inviting his errant people to return to a covenant relationship with him.<\/p>",
