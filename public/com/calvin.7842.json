    "html": " <p> <i>In righteousness. <\/i> He means that God will be the maker and architect of his Church. I am aware that there are some who explain it differently, and who think that \u201crighteousness\u201d means \u201cgood\u00adworks.\u201d And indeed that exposition has some plausibility, arising from the Prophet having spoken about doctrine; for we are taught for this very purpose, that we may lead a pious and holy life. But the Prophet\u2019s meaning was different, namely, that the Church shall be restored under God\u2019s guidance, who wishes to be its guardian and defender, he contrasts \u201crighteousness\u201d with the violence and oppression by which the Church has been thrown down, or, at least, he expresses \u201cstability,\u201d as if he had said that it shall not be a frail building, or one that might impose on men for a short time by mere deceitfulness of appearance; because God will sincerely defend his work, and, being \u201crighteous,\u201d will not only restore it completely, but will afterwards preserve it in safety for a long period. Thus, although men are leagued in every way for the destruction of the Church, they will gain nothing; for the Lord guards her by his \u201crighteousness.\u201d We have formerly seen this form of expression; and on this account I think that the interpretation which I have given is more simple, though some may think that another interpretation is more plausible. <\/p> ",
