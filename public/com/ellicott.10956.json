On this assumption, \u201cdestruction from the destroyer\u201d would be a fair equivalent. The name, occurring frequently in the earlier books of the Old Testament (twenty-three times in Job and eight in the Pentateuch), was characteristic of the pre-Mosaic creed of Israel (<a class=\"ref\">Exodus 6:3<\/a>), and occurs but seldom in the prophets: here, and in <a class=\"ref\">Joel 1:15; Ezekiel 1:24; Ezekiel 10:5<\/a>.<\/p>",
