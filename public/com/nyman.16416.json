The reference is to rulers who have come under the influence of Satan and not solely to Nebuchadnezzar or one of his successors. The binding of Satan at the beginning of the thousand years is also prophesied in the New Testament (see <a class=\"ref\">Rev. 20:1-3<\/a>), the Book of Mormon (see <a class=\"ref\">1 Ne. 22:26<\/a>), and the Doctrine and Covenants (see 43:31; 88:110; 101:28). First <a class=\"ref\">1 Ne. 22:15<\/a> suggests that the prophecy of the binding of Satan used by Nephi may have been taken from Isaiah.<\/p>     ",
