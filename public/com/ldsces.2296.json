    "html": "<p>In chapter 13, verses 11&ndash;12, Isaiah repeats a refrain used earlier (see <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzczNSI6NH0=\">Isaiah 4:1&ndash;4<\/a>), that righteous men will become as difficult to find as precious gold and will be treasured as highly. The wicked will be cleansed from the earth, and the worthy righteous will remain to become the precious jewels in the royal diadem of the Lord (see <a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 60:4; Isaiah 62:1&ndash;3<\/a>). Indeed, the treasure of &ldquo;the golden wedge of Ophir&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3OTE5XQ==\">Isaiah 13:12<\/a>), the rich, gold-producing province of India, is insignificant compared to the worth of one righteous man (compare <a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 18:10<\/a>).<\/p><p class=\"cite\">LDS Church Educational System Old Testament Student Manual, 1 Kings&ndash;Malachi, Religion 302, Chapter 14, Item 7<\/p>",
