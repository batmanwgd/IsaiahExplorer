    "html": "<p> (4) Surely he hath borne our griefs . . .\u2014The words are spoken as by those who had before despised the Servant of Jehovah, and have learnt the secret of His humiliation. \u201cGrief\u201d and \u201csorrow,\u201d as before, imply \u201cdisease\u201d and \u201cpain,\u201d and St. Matthew\u2019s application of the text ( <a class=\"ref\">Matthew 8:17<\/a>) is therefore quite legitimate. The words \u201cstricken, smitten of God,\u201d are used elsewhere specially of leprosy and other terrible sicknesses ( <a class=\"ref\">Genesis 12:17; Leviticus 13:3; Leviticus 13:9; Numbers 14:12; 1 Samuel 6:9; 2 Kings 15:5<\/a>). So the Vulg. gives leprosus. The word for \u201cborne,\u201d like the Greek in <a class=\"ref\">John 1:29<\/a> , implies both the \u201ctaking upon himself,\u201d and the \u201ctaking away from others,\u201d i.e., the true idea of vicarious and mediatorial atonement.<\/p> ",
