Paul referred to this verse in one of his letters to the Corinthians in connection with the gift of tongues (<a class=\"ref\">1 Cor. 14:20-22<\/a>). This passage may have an alternate reading. Perhaps the Lord announces here that he will speak to his people through weak mortal lips and slow speech\u2014and perhaps even through a messenger from another land.<\/p> <p><i>this people. <\/i>The inhabitants of Ephraim, the Northern Kingdom. In a broader sense, this can apply to the covenant people in all ages.<\/p> ",
