How, then, did Shebna end up in his tomb (22:16), if he died in exile? Either his body was returned from his exiled land to Jerusalem for burial, or, more likely, Shebna was a symbol of all wicked people.<\/p> <p><i>the chariots of thy glory.<\/i> <i>Chariots<\/i> represent the self-reliance, self-might, and glory of the wicked as they look to war and weaponry for temporal salvation. Meanwhile, the righteous view God as both their temporal and spiritual salvation; he is their refuge and place of safety.<\/p> ",
