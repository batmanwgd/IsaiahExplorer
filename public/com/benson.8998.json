They shall either <i>be hid in the day of the Lord\u2019s anger, <\/i>or shall have divine supports and comforts, which shall abound in proportion as trials and troubles abound. \u201cThis is an admirable sentence to support the souls of the pious, amidst all the calamities of this life. God will not forsake those who truly love and serve him. This, reason teaches us; this, the experience of all times confirms; and it is the constant and comfortable doctrine of the word of God. The event must and will be happy to the good man.\u201d <i>Wo unto the wicked, <\/i>&c. \u2014 These heavy judgments are designed against them, and shall certainly find them out, though here they be mixed with the righteous. As happiness, either in this world or the next, is, by the divine determination, the certain consequence of righteousness, so the contrary is the certain consequence of wickedness.<\/p>",
