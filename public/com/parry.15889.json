Many translations read \"all nations\" rather than \"Gentiles,\" further cementing the idea that \"every one\" is attracted by Zion's glory (2:2).<\/p> <p><i> kings to&hellip;thy rising.<\/i> Some scholars believe that this prophecy was fulfilled when the wise men traveled from the east to worship the baby Jesus (<a class=\"ref\">Matt. 2:1-2<\/a>). That may have been one fulfillment of the prophecy, but the context tells us that a more complete fulfillment will come in the latter days. <i>Light<\/i> and <i>brightness<\/i> here may refer to the spiritual light the Lord's covenant people will spread to the nations (42:6; 49:6). <i>Rising<\/i> suggests the rising sun; symbolically it may refer to the rising up, or restoration, of the gospel or of Israel. It also refers to the coming of the Lord, described in the same terms in 60:1, 2.<\/p> ",
