The \u201clarge country\u201d is, probably, the plain of Mesopotamia, where Shebna is to end his days in exile.<\/p> \n<p>There the chariots of thy glory shall be the shame of thy lord\u2019s house.\u2014Better, Thither shall go the chariots of thy glory, the shame of thy lord\u2019s house. The words point to another form of Shebna\u2019s ostentatious pride. Not content with riding on an ass or mule, as even judges and counsellors rode (<a class=\"ref\">Judges 5:10; Judges 10:4; Judges 12:14; 2 Samuel 17:23<\/a>), he had appeared in public in stately chariots, such as were used by kings (Song<a class=\"ref\">Song of Solomon 1:9; Song of Solomon 3:9<\/a>). These were to accompany him in his exile, but it would be as the spoil of the conqueror. There are no records of the fulfilment of the prediction, and the judgment may have been averted by repentance; but when we next meet with Shebna (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MzUzXQ==\">Isaiah 36:22<\/a>) he is in the inferior position of a scribe, and Eliakim occupies his place as being \u201cover the household.\u201d<\/p> ",
