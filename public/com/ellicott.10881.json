The prophet enforces precept by example. He has learnt to conquer the feverish desire to know the future, which led men to trust in soothsayers and diviners, and from which even his own disciples were not altogether exempt. He is content to \u201cwait,\u201d even though Jehovah \u201chide His face,\u201d though predictions seem to fail (see Note on <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODA5XQ==\">Isaiah 8:1<\/a>), and all seems dark and hopeless. There is, perhaps, a contrast between the fact that Jehovah hides His face from the house of Jacob, that all is dark for the nation\u2019s life as such, while yet the prophet, in his own individuality, can \u201clook for Him\u201d with the eye of faith. <\/p> ",
