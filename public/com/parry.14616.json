    "html": " <i> reason together.<\/i> The Lord tells the elders of his church in our era that the purpose of reasoning together is \"that ye may understand\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 50:10-12<\/a>; see also <a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 61:13; 45:10<\/a>). Reasoning together with the Lord is a process that requires prayer and revelation.<\/p> <p><i>scarlet\/crimson.<\/i> In this passage scarlet (a bright red) and crimson (a deep red) are both used to symbolize blood, which in turn can signify iniquity. The sins of the children of Israel were both bright and deep-seated, hence this imagery (see <i>hands are full of blood<\/i> in 1:15).<\/p> <p> <i>snow\/wool.<\/i> The Lord, through Isaiah, contrasts the bloodlike colors scarlet and crimson with two tangible materials, snow and wool, both of which are white. White symbolizes purity, innocence, and light. In addition, wool, as a product from the lamb, points to the atonement of Jesus, the \"Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world\" (<a class=\"ref\">John 1:29<\/a>). <\/p> ",
