    "html": " <i>Woe. <\/i>This word invokes severe anguish and distress upon those who <i>destroy<\/i> and <i>deal treacherously<\/i> with others.<\/p> <p><i>destroy\/dealest treacherously. <\/i>A woe pronounced upon those who destroy and who deal evil unto others. The phrases apply historically to the Assyrian king Sennacherib, who had offered to spare the lives of the inhabitants of Jerusalem if they agreed to pay him tribute (<a class=\"ref\">2 Kgs. 18:13-16<\/a>). At great cost they paid him tribute, but he <i>treacherously<\/i> continued his attack against them, seeking to <i>destroy<\/i> them. These phrases also apply to the wicked of any age who deal treacherously with others.<\/p> <p><i>when thou shalt cease destroying, thou shalt be destroyed. <\/i>Isaiah's prophecy was fulfilled. The Lord destroyed 185,000 men in a single night, and the king abandoned his camp and fled to Nineveh, where he was murdered by his sons (see commentary on 37:38).<\/p> ",
