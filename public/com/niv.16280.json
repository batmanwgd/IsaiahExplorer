They are stupid \u201cshepherds,\u201d who are only interested in taking care of themselves and have no concern for the flock. Clearly this is the leadership of the nation, and with what follows, they are evidently the religious leaders. The nation is in a desperate spiritual condition, and the leaders do not care. This is similar to what Amos said when he accused the elite of northern Israel of indulging their appetites with no awareness of the tragic condition of the house of Joseph (Amos 6:6).<\/p>     <p>\u2003Isaiah is implying that simply a return from captivity will not guarantee a new set of behaviors for the people unless there is a radical change in the attitude and behavior of the leaders from that which he has experienced in his own day (cf. chs. 26\u201328). If the leaders continue to be self-centered and power hungry, the flock entrusted to them will continue to be overtaken by their spiritual enemies (56:9). Moreover, there will be so little spiritual perception that the disappearance of the \u201crighteous\u201d from among them will go unnoticed (57:1\u20132). The passing away of an older, more faithful generation will cause no alarm. The fact that they have been graciously delivered from the increasing chaos of a degenerate society will never occur to either the leaders or the followers in that degenerate society.<\/p>     ",
