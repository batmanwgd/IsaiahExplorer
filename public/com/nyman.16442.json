The wiping away of the tears refers to the effects of the Atonement; this metaphor is used twice by John (see <a class=\"ref\">Rev. 7:17; 21:4<\/a>). The \"rebuke of his people\" represents the continual trials and afflictions which the Savior will cause to cease among Israel. Thus this verse is clearly a messianic prophecy, or a testimony of what Christ will do for the world, and especially for Israel.<\/p>     ",
