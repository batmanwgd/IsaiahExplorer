    "html": " <p> <em>None calleth for justice <\/em>&mdash;Or rather, there is no one who brings a suit with justice; no one who goes into court for the purpose of obtaining justice. There is a love of litigation; a desire to take all the advantage which the law can give; a desire to appeal to the law, not for the sake of having strict justice done, but for the sake of doing injury to others, and to take some undue advantage. <\/p> <p> <em>Nor any pleadeth for truth <\/em>&mdash;Or, no one pleadeth with truth. He does not state the cause as it is. He makes use of cunning and falsehood to gain his cause. <\/p> <p> <em>They trust in vanity <\/em>&mdash;They confide in quirks and evasions rather than in the justice of their cause. <\/p> <p> <em>They conceive mischief <\/em>&mdash;They form plans of evil, and they execute them when they are fully ripe. Compare <a class=\"ref\">Job 15:35 <\/a>,, where the same phrase occurs. The sense is, that they form plans to injure others, and that they expect to execute them by fraud and deceit. <\/p>,",
