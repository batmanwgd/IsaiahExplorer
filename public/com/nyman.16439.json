Elder Theodore M. Burton also referred to these verses as evidence of a spirit prison which Christ visited, noting that it is not a reference to political prisoners on-the earth (see CR, Oct. 1964, p. 33). <a class=\"ref\">Rev. 21:23<\/a> seems to describe a condition similar to the one in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTE5XQ==\">Isaiah 24:23<\/a>. According to Elder Orson Pratt, the moon will be confounded and the sun ashamed \"because of the superior light that will attend the presence of the being who is to reign in Zion and Jerusalem\" (JD, 20:12).<\/p>     ",
