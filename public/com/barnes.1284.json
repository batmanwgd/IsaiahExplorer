    "html": "<p><em>For his God doth instruct him...<\/em>&mdash;Margin, &lsquo;He bindeth it in such sort as his God doth teach him.&rsquo; The more correct idea is conveyed in the text. The word \u05d9\u05e1\u05e8\u05d5 yisero\u0302, properly means, he instructs, admonishes, or teaches him. The idea that skill in agriculture is communicated by God is not one that is discordant to reason, or to the general teachings of the Bible. Thus the achitectural and mechanical skill of Bezaleel and Aholiab, by which they were enabled to make the tabernacle, is said expressly to have been imparted to them by God <a class=\"ref\">Exodus 31:2-6<\/a>. Thus also Noah was taught how to build the ark <a class=\"ref\">Genesis 6:14-16<\/a>. We are not, indeed, to suppose that the farmer is inspired; or that God communicates to him by special revelation where, and when, and how he shall sow his grain, but the sense is, that God is the author of all his skill. He has endowed him with understanding, and taught him by his providence. It is by the study of what God teaches in the seasons, in the soil, in the results of experience and observation, that he has this art. He teaches him also by the example, the counsel, and even by the failures of others; and all the knowledge of agriculture that he has is to be traced up to God.<\/p>",
