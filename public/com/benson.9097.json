Or the meaning may be, He shall not judge rashly and partially, but considerately and justly, as the fear of God obliges all judges to do. <i>And he shall not judge <\/i>\u2014 Of persons, things, or causes; <i>after the sight of the eyes <\/i>\u2014 According to outward appearance, as men do, because they cannot search men\u2019s hearts; <i>neither reprove <\/i>\u2014 Condemn, or pass sentence against any person; <i>after the hearing of the ears <\/i>\u2014 By uncertain rumours or suggestions, but shall thoroughly examine all causes, and search out the truth of things, and the very hearts of men. It implies also, that, \u201cin collecting the people who shall compose his kingdom, he shall principally regard in them this quality of fear, or reverence for the Lord; and with the greatest sagacity and perspicuity of judgment, shall discern and separate those subjects in whom he finds this quality; not suffering that judgment to be deluded by the external appearance of truth or honesty, but, penetrating into the interior recesses of the mind by his prophetic spirit, he shall discriminate truth from error, the good from the bad, the sincere and pious from the hypocritical and impious.\u201d <i>All the churches shall know, <\/i>says he, <i>that I am he who searcheth the reins and the hearts.<\/i><\/p>",
