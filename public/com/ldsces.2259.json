    "html": " <p>Another rendering of the first phrase from the Hebrew suggests more clearly what was intended: &ldquo;the foundations of the thresholds trembled&rdquo; (Isaiah 6:4 <em>a <\/em>). The presence of smoke was symbolic of the presence and glory of God (see <a class=\"ref\">Exodus 19:18; Revelation 15:8 <\/a>). Fire and smoke are frequently used to depict the glory of celestial realms. In the language of Joseph Smith: <\/p> <p>&ldquo;God Almighty Himself dwells in eternal fire; flesh and blood cannot go there, for all corruption is devoured by the fire. &lsquo;Our God is a consuming fire. [ <a class=\"ref\">Deuteronomy 4:24; Hebrews 12:29 <\/a> ].&rsquo; When our flesh is quickened by the Spirit, there will be no blood in this tabernacle. Some dwell in higher glory than others. <\/p> <p>&ldquo;&hellip; Immortality dwells in everlasting burnings.&rdquo; (<em>Teachings, <\/em> p. 367.) <\/p> <p class=\"cite\"> LDS Church Educational System Old Testament Student Manual, 1 Kings&ndash;Malachi, Religion 302, Chapter 13, Item 35 <\/p> ",
