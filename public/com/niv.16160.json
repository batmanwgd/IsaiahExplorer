They will shudder with fear at the uplifted hand that the L<small>ORD<\/small> Almighty raises against them. And the land of Judah will bring terror to the Egyptians; everyone to whom Judah is mentioned will be terrified, because of what the L<small>ORD<\/small> Almighty is planning against them.<\/p>         <p>\u2003In that day five cities in Egypt will speak the language of Canaan and swear allegiance to the L<small>ORD<\/small> Almighty. One of them will be called the City of Destruction.<\/p>         <p>\u2003In that day there will be an altar to the L<small>ORD<\/small> in the heart of Egypt, and a monument to the L<small>ORD<\/small> at its border. It will be a sign and witness to the L<small>ORD<\/small> Almighty in the land of Egypt. When they cry out to the L<small>ORD<\/small> because of their oppressors, he will send them a savior and defender, and he will rescue them. So the L<small>ORD<\/small> will make himself known to the Egyptians, and in that day they will acknowledge the L<small>ORD<\/small>. They will worship with sacrifices and grain offerings; they will make vows to the L<small>ORD<\/small> and keep them. The L<small>ORD<\/small> will strike Egypt with a plague; he will strike them and heal them. They will turn to the L<small>ORD<\/small>, and he will respond to their pleas and heal them.<\/p>         <p>\u2003In that day there will be a highway from Egypt to Assyria. The Assyrians will go to Egypt and the Egyptians to Assyria. The Egyptians and Assyrians will worship together. In that day Israel will be the third, along with Egypt and Assyria, a blessing on the earth. The L<small>ORD<\/small> Almighty will bless them, saying, \u201cBlessed be Egypt my people, Assyria my handiwork, and Israel my inheritance.\u201d<\/p>         <p>\u2003In the year that the supreme commander, sent by Sargon king of Assyria, came to Ashdod and attacked and captured it\u2014at that time the L<small>ORD<\/small> spoke through Isaiah son of Amoz. He said to him, \u201cTake off the sackcloth from your body and the sandals from your feet.\u201d And he did so, going around stripped and barefoot.<\/p>         <p>\u2003Then the L<small>ORD<\/small> said, \u201cJust as my servant Isaiah has gone stripped and barefoot for three years, as a sign and portent against Egypt and Cush, so the king of Assyria will lead away stripped and barefoot the Egyptian captives and Cushite exiles, young and old, with buttocks bared\u2014to Egypt\u2019s shame. Those who trusted in Cush and boasted in Egypt will be afraid and put to shame. In that day the people who live on this coast will say, \u2018See what has happened to those we relied on, those we fled to for help and deliverance from the king of Assyria! How then can we escape?\u2019\u201d<\/p>     <\/blockquote>     <h4>Original Meaning<\/h4>     <p>T<small>HIS ORACLE CONCERNING<\/small> Egypt falls into three parts. The first part (19:1\u201315) predicts Egypt\u2019s fall, showing that none of the great gifts that this nation has historically relied on can save her from the coming judgment. The second part (19:16\u201325) speaks of the way in which after judgment, Egypt will one day turn to worship Israel\u2019s God. The third part (20:1\u20136), true to form, reverts to the present and the certainty of Egypt\u2019s judgment. In all of this the reiteration of the theme of this part of the book is clear. Why would one trust Egypt since she cannot save herself and since she will one day turn to worship the very God Israel is now fearing to trust?<\/p>     ",
