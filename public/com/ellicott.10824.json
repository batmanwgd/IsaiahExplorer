The lands that have been gained by oppression shall, in the day of retribution, become common pasture ground instead of being reserved for the parks and gardens of the rich; and strangers\u2014i.e., invaders, Philistines, Assyrians, or nomadic tribes\u2014shall devour the produce (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTc2NjI=\">Isaiah 1:7<\/a>). Possibly, however, the \u201clambs\u201d may stand for the poor and meek, as in contrast with the \u201cfat ones\u201d of the earth. The LXX. version follows a different reading in the second clause, and gives \u201ckids\u201d instead of \u201cstrangers.\u201d<\/p>",
