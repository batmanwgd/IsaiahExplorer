    "html": "<p><em>And I will wait upon the Lord<\/em>&mdash;This is the commencement of a new subject. The prophet had closed his former message; but had seen that in regard to the great mass of the nation, his exhortation had been in vain. He now says, that having delivered his message, he would patiently look to God alone. His hope was in him, though the nation looked elsewhere; and though calamities were coming, yet he would still trust in God only.<\/p><p><em>That hideth his face<\/em>&mdash;This is a figurative expression, denoting the withdrawing of his favor and protection. He would leave them, and give them to deserved punishment; compare <a class=\"ref\">Job 23:9; Job 13:24; Psalm 44:24; Psalm 10:1; Psalm 104:29<\/a>.<\/p><p><em>And I will look for him<\/em>&mdash;I will expect aid from him, and will believe that his promises of final protection will yet be fulfilled; compare <a class=\"ref\">Habakkuk 2:3<\/a>:<\/p><p>For the vision is yet for an appointed time,<\/p><p>But at the end it shall speak, and not lie:<\/p><p>Though it tarry, wait for it;<\/p><p>Because it will surely come, it will not tarry.<\/p> ",
