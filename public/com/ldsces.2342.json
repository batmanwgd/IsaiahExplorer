Later, they shall &ldquo;be gathered one by one&rdquo; back to their holy city, Jerusalem (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTY0XQ==\">v. 12<\/a>; see also <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MTY1XQ==\">v. 13<\/a>). <\/p> <p>The allegory of Zenos in <a class=\"ref\">Jacob 5<\/a> contains similar imagery and may be studied profitably in connection with this chapter. <\/p> <p class=\"cite\"> LDS Church Educational System Old Testament Student Manual, 1 Kings&ndash;Malachi, Religion 302, Chapter 15, Item 10 <\/p> ",
