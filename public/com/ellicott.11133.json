The curse is personified as a beast of prey or a consuming fire, ready to devour. (Comp. <a class=\"ref\">Genesis 4:7; Genesis 4:11<\/a>.)<\/p>\n <p>They that dwell therein are desolate.\u2014Better, bear their punishment, or are dealt with as guilty.<\/p>\n <p>Are burned.\u2014The word determines, perhaps, the sense of the word \u201cdevour\u201d in the previous clause. The curse, the symbol of the wrath of Jehovah, is the consuming fire that burns.<\/p>",
