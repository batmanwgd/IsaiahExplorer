    "html": " <p> Isaiah prophesies to all the peoples of the earth, as signaled by his use of the words <i>nations,<\/i> <i>people,<\/i> <i>the<\/i> <i>earth,<\/i> and <i>the<\/i> <i>world<\/i> in 34:1. His message is plain: the Lord is angry with the nations of the earth and their armies; therefore, he is going to destroy them at his second coming. Isaiah's words regarding the destruction are vivid and descriptive\u2014 <i>utterly<\/i> <i>destroyed,<\/i> <i>slaughter,<\/i> <i>slain,<\/i> <i>carcases,<\/i> <i>blood,<\/i> <i>filled<\/i> <i>with<\/i> <i>blood,<\/i> <i>sacrifice,<\/i> and <i>soaked<\/i> <i>with<\/i> <i>blood.<\/i> In addition, Isaiah's terminology recalls animal sacrifice at the Lord's temple: <i>slaughter,<\/i> <i>blood,<\/i> <i>fat,<\/i> <i>blood<\/i> <i>of<\/i> <i>lambs<\/i> <i>and<\/i> <i>goats,<\/i> and <i>fat<\/i> <i>of<\/i> <i>the<\/i> <i>kidneys<\/i> <i>of<\/i> <i>rams.<\/i> The Lord is going to destroy the nations as if they were sacrificial animals.<\/p> <p>Isaiah's symbolism is clear to us: those who accept the Savior's atoning sacrifice will be delivered from destruction, but those who reject his atonement will be slaughtered, as were the sacrificial animals of his temple. During all this slaughter, Jehovah will \"uphold Zion's cause\" (NIV 34:8) and protect his Saints.<\/p> <blockquote> Come near, <i>ye nations,<\/i> to <u>hear<\/u>;     <br>and <u>hearken<\/u><i>,<\/i> <i>ye people:<\/i>     <br>let the <i>earth<\/i> hear, and <u>all that is therein<\/u>;     <br>the <i>world,<\/i> and <u>all things that come forth of it<\/u><i>.<\/i> (34:1)     <br>For the [<i>wrath<\/i>] <i>of the Lord<\/i> is upon all <u>nations<\/u><i>,<\/i>     <br>and <i>his fury<\/i> upon all their <u>armies<\/u>:     <br><i>he<\/i> hath utterly <u>destroyed them<\/u>,     <br><i>he<\/i> hath <u>delivered them to the slaughter<\/u><i>.<\/i> (34:2)     <br><i>Their slain<\/i> also shall <u>be cast out<\/u><i>,<\/i>     <br>and <i>their stink<\/i> shall <u>come up out<\/u> of their carcases,     <br>and the <i>mountains<\/i> shall be <u>melted<\/u> with their blood.
