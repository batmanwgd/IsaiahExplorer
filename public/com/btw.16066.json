The Lord will be a sanctuary for those who choose him to rule over them, but a stumbling block to those who reject him. Those who seek wisdom from wizards and familiar spirits (mediums) will receive darkness.  <\/p>  <p>  D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu all over again. Didn't we just get this message in 2 Nephi 17? Note the similar elements\u2014a child is born; while he is still young, the kingdoms of Syria and Israel will be destroyed; Assyria will almost destroy Judah. Why the repetition? One scholar explained:  <\/p>  <blockquote>  Having been unsuccessful in his efforts to persuade King Ahaz to put his trust in the Lord rather than in the Assyrians, Isaiah next turns his attention to the people of Judah. He repeats the assurance given in the previous chapter to their king that in a very short time Syria and the northern kingdom (Ephraim or Israel) will be destroyed. However, the faith of the people is as shortsighted as their royal ruler, and as a consequence Isaiah prophesies that the Assyrians will invade the southern kingdom of Judah.
