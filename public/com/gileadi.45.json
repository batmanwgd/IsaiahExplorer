While his &ldquo;arising&rdquo; (<em>qumo <\/em>) spells doom for the wicked, Jehovah makes provision for the righteous (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODI5MCI6OH0=\">Isaiah 33:10-17<\/a>; cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODI1MyI6NH0=\">31:2-5<\/a>). To those who trust in him, Jehovah&rsquo;s &ldquo;awesome presence&rdquo; and the &ldquo;brightness of his glory&rdquo; signify imminent deliverance (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc3MzkiOjJ9LHsiMTg4MjMiOjJ9LHsiMTg4NDEiOjJ9XQ==\">Isaiah 4:5-6; 60:1-2, 19-20<\/a>).
