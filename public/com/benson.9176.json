The prophet may possibly mean a cavalry in two parts, with two sorts of riders; riders on asses, or mules, and riders on camels: or led on by two riders, one on an ass, and one on a camel.\u201d Or, as some think, the verse may be rendered, <i>He saw a cavalcade, two file of horse,<\/i>,(<span class=\"hebrew_text\">,\u05e6\u05de\u05d3 \u05e4\u05e8\u05e9\u05c1\u05d9\u05dd<\/span>,) <i>with ass-carriages, <\/i> <i>and carriages of camels; and he attended with very close attention.<\/i>, According to this translation, the meaning is, that the watchman saw the army of the Medes and Persians, with their usual cavalcade of horse, (attended by those beasts of burden, asses and camels, which accompanied armies,) moving toward Babylon; upon which he gave the greatest attention possible. Or, according to the common reading, Darius and Cyrus, leading the Medes and Persians, are intended to be distinguished by the two riders, or the two sorts of cattle. The baggage of Cyrus\u2019s army, Herodotus tells us, was carried on camels. <\/p>",
