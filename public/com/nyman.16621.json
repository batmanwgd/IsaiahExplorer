Yes, certainly; and not only Gentiles, kings and great men, but many of all the nations of the earth have got to come to Zion .... \"(JD, 18:153.)<\/p>     <p>The wise men who came from the east because they had seen the new star at Christ's birth are thought by some scholars to have fulfilled this prophecy (see <a class=\"ref\">Matt. 2:1-2<\/a>). However, an examination of the entire prophecy shows that Isaiah is speaking of a later time period and a different geographic area, although, due to the nature of dual prophecy, it could also have had reference to the Savior's birth.<\/p>     ",
