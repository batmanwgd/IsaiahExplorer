    "html": " <p>Zion will come to the fulness of her being suddenly, as a woman who gives birth without any pains or travail (66:7). And just as surely as a woman comes to the point of delivery and gives birth, so surely will Zion come to her fruition when her time has come (66:8-9). Those who now mourn because Zion has not yet come will then rejoice and be glad (66:10). She will have peace from the Lord, and he will give her spiritual sustenance, comfort, and care, even as a mother cares for her infant child (66:11-14).<\/p> <p> The repetition of the image of woman and mother here is notable. We have a woman bearing a child (66:7-9), Jerusalem as a female (66:10), a mother nourishing her children at her breast (66:11-12), and a mother giving comfort to her children (66:13). By using these images, the Lord shows us how thoroughly the children of Zion, after their long trials, will be blessed and comforted.<\/p> <blockquote><i>Before she travailed,<\/i> she <u>brought forth<\/u>;     <br><i>before her pain<\/i> came, she was<u> delivered<\/u> of a man child. (66:7)     <br>Who hath <i>heard<\/i> such a thing?     <br>who hath <i>seen<\/i> such things?     <br>Shall the <i>earth<\/i> be made to <u>bring forth<\/u> in one day?     <br>or shall a <i>nation<\/i> be <u>born<\/u> at once?     <br>for as soon as <i>Zion<\/i> <u>travailed<\/u>,     <br><i>she<\/i> <u>brought forth her children<\/u>. (66:8)     <br><i>Shall I bring to the birth,<\/i> and <u>not cause to bring forth? saith the Lord<\/u>:     <br><i>shall I cause to bring forth,<\/i> and <u>shut the womb? saith thy God<\/u>. (66:9)     <br><i>Rejoice ye with Jerusalem,<\/i> and <i>be glad with her,<\/i> <u>all ye that love her<\/u>:     <br><i>rejoice for joy with her,<\/i> <u>all ye that mourn for her<\/u>: (66:10)     <br><i>That ye may suck,<\/i> and <u>be satisfied with the breasts of her consolations<\/u>;     <br><i>that ye may milk out,<\/i> and <u>be delighted with the abundance of her glory<\/u>. (66:11)     <br>For thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will extend peace to her <u>like a river<\/u>,     <br>and the glory of the Gentiles <u>like a flowing stream<\/u>:     <br>then shall ye suck, ye shall <i>be borne<\/i> <u>upon her sides<\/u>,     <br>and <i>be dandled<\/i> <u>upon her knees<\/u>. (66:12)     <br>As one whom his <i>mother<\/i> <u>comforteth<\/u>,     <br>so will <i>I <\/i> <u>comfort<\/u> you; and ye shall <u>be comforted<\/u> in Jerusalem. (66:13)     <br>And when ye see this, <i>your<\/i> <i>heart<\/i> <u>shall rejoice<\/u>,     <br>and <i>your bones<\/i> <u>shall flourish like an herb<\/u>: (66:14a)<\/blockquote> ",
