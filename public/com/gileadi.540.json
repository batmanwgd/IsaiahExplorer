Must they now repeat that part of their past as they come to history&rsquo;s finale? From the very first to the very last Jehovah cautions them to cease worshiping the works of men&rsquo;s hands. Moses warned them in his day even as Jehovah&rsquo;s servant does now (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg4NzgiOjN9LHsiMTg2NjciOjh9XQ==\">vv 11-13; Isaiah 50:4-11<\/a>).<\/p>",
