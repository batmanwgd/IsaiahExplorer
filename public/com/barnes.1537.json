    "html": "<p><em>That bringeth the princes to nothing<\/em> &mdash;That is, all princes and kings. No matter how great their power, their wealth, and their dignity, they are, by his hand, reduced to nothing before him. The design of this passage is to contrast the majesty of God with that of princes and nobles, and to show how far he excels them all. The general truth is therefore stated, that all monarchs are by him removed from their thrones, and consigned to nothing. The same idea is expressed in<a class=\"ref\">Job 12:21<\/a> :<\/p><p>He poureth contempt upon princes,<\/p><p>And weakeneth the strength of the mighty.<\/p><p>And in<a class=\"ref\">Psalm 107:40<\/a> :<\/p><p>He poureth contempt upon princes,<\/p><p>And causeth them to wander in the wilderness where there is no way.<\/p><p>The particular idea here, as appears from the next verse, is, that the princes and rulers who are opposed to God constitute no real resistance to the execution of his purposes. He can strip off their honors and glory, and obliterate even their names.<\/p><p><em>He maketh the judges of the earth<\/em> &mdash;Kings and princes often executed judgment personally, and hence, the words judges and kings seem to be synonymous as they are used here, and in<a class=\"ref\">Psalm 2:10<\/a> :<\/p><p>Be wise now, therefore, O ye kings;<\/p><p>Be instructed, ye judges of the earth.<\/p> ",
