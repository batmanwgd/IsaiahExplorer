    "html": "          <p>Through the strength of the Lord, Ephraim is to accomplish three things: (1) He will raise up the tribes of Jacob. These twelve tribes constitute the lost tribes, the Jews, and the Lamanites. Although they remained intact after their dispersion, they were not producing fruit unto the Lord at the time of the Restoration (see <a class=\"ref\">Jacob 5:38-39<\/a>). (2) He will restore the preserved of Israel. These are those who have the blood of Israel but have been scattered among all the nations of the earth, as prophesied by Amos (9:8-9), and have lost their identity (see <a class=\"ref\">Jacob 5:52-54<\/a>). (3) He will be a light to the Gentiles. At the same time that Ephraim will gather those of the blood of Israel from among the nations of the world, he will give the Gentiles an opportunity to be adopted into Israel. Thus the blessing of Abraham to all nations will be under way. and salvation will be extended \"unto the end of the earth.\" The Doctrine and Covenants also calls the priesthood holders of this dispensation to be <i>\"a<\/i> light unto the Gentiles\" and \"a savior unto my people Israel\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 86:11<\/a>).<\/p>     <p>Paul and Barnabas quoted the last part of verse 6 to show that the Gentiles were to receive the gospel after the Jews had rejected it (see <a class=\"ref\">Acts 13:47<\/a>). This did not completely fulfill Isaiah's prophecy, but was an application made by Paul and Barnabas.<\/p>     ",
