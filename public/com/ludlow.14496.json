    "html": "<p>Isaiah reveals many great truths about the Savior in this chapter, emphasizing the Lord&rsquo;s covenant relationship with Israel, foreshadowing His future sacrifice, and outlining His noble qualities we should emulate. After quoting this chapter and <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 51<\/a>, the Book of Mormon prophet Jacob proclaims that he has &ldquo;read these things that [we] might know concerning the covenants of the Lord that he has covenanted with all the house of Israel&rdquo; (<a class=\"ref\">2 Nephi 9:1<\/a>). In addition, several phrases not found in present Bible translations are recorded in Jacob&rsquo;s quotation, more fully developing the ancient text. By carefully studying this chapter and then reading Jacob&rsquo;s inspired commentary in <a class=\"ref\">2 Nephi 9<\/a>, we can develop a greater understanding and appreciation for Isaiah&rsquo;s powerful messages.<\/p>",
