    "html": " <p>This section discusses the following:<\/p> <p> Isaiah is first instructed to \"bind the testimony\" and \"seal the law\" (8:16).<\/p> <p> Isaiah and his family are living symbols unto the house of Israel. Their names also are prophetic and serve to instruct the house of Israel according to God's plan (8:18).<\/p> <p>Israel wanders lost and alone in the telestial world because of her sins, which have separated her from God (8:21). She does not follow the prophetic word; instead she seeks the word of God through wizards and familiar spirits (8:19).<\/p> <p>The world will be walking in darkness, apostasy, and the \"shadow of death\" when a \"great light,\" Jesus Christ, will make an appearance (8:22; 9:2).<\/p> <blockquote> Bind up the testimony,     <br><i>seal the law<\/i> among my disciples. (8:16)     <br>And <i>I will<\/i> <u>wait upon the Lord<\/u>, that hideth his face from the house of Jacob,     <br>and <i>I will<\/i> <u>look for him<\/u>. (8:17)     <br>Behold, <i>I and the children<\/i> whom the <u>Lord<\/u> hath given me     <br>are <i>for signs and for wonders<\/i> in Israel from the <u>Lord of hosts<\/u>, which dwelleth in mount Zion. (8:18)     <br>And when they shall say unto you:     <br><i>Seek<\/i> unto them that have <u>familiar spirits<\/u>,<b> <\/b>and unto <u>wizards<\/u> that peep and mutter\u2014     <br>should not a people <i>seek<\/i> unto their <u>God<\/u> for the living to [hear from] the dead? (8:19)     <br>To the law and to the testimony: [and] if they speak not according to this word,     <br>it is because there is no light in them (8:20)     <br>And <i>they<\/i> shall [roam through the land], [hard pressed] and <u>hungry<\/u>:     <br>and it shall come to pass, that when <i>they<\/i> shall be <u>hungry<\/u>,     <br>they shall [<i>make themselves angry<\/i>],     <br>and <i>curse their king and their God,<\/i>     <br>and <i>look<\/i> <u>upward<\/u>. (8:21)     <br>And they shall <i>look<\/i> <u>unto the earth<\/u>;     <br>and <i>behold<\/i> <u>trouble and darkness<\/u>, dimness of anguish;     <br>and they shall be <i>driven<\/i> to <u>darkness<\/u>. (8:22)     <br>Nevertheless the dimness shall not be such as was in her vexation,     <br>when at the first he <i>lightly afflicted<\/i> the <u>land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali<\/u>,     <br>and[afterward[s] did more <i>grievously afflict by the <u>way of the [Red]<\/u> <u> Sea<\/u>, <u>beyond Jordan in Galilee of the nations<\/u>. (9:1)<\/i>     <br>The <i>people<\/i> that <u>walked in darkness<\/u> have seen a great light:     <br><i>they<\/i> that <u>dwell in the land of the shadow of death<\/u>, upon them hath the light shined.
