In the history of Judges (<a class=\"ref\">Judges 7:25<\/a>), Oreb and Zeeb are the names at once of the Midianite chiefs and of the places where they were slain.<\/p>\n <p>As his rod was upon the sea.\u2014The italics spoil the sense. Better, His rod upon the sea . . . He shall lift it up after the manner of Egypt. The ambiguous formula which had been taken as primarily of evil boding in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTc4NzU=\">Isaiah 10:24<\/a>, is repeated as an augury of good. There was another rod prominent in that Egyptian history besides that of the oppressor, and that rod had been wielded by the deliverer.<\/p>",
