    "html": "<p><a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODY2OCI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 50:5-6<\/a>.<i>The Lord hath opened mine ear \u2014 <\/i>Hath given me a power and will to hear and receive his commands. <i>And I was not rebellious <\/i>\u2014 I readily did and suffered what he required of me. <i>Neither turned away back<\/i> \u2014 From hearing or obeying his will, how difficult or dangerous soever the work might be to which he called me. He seems to allude to some of the former prophets, who had shrunk back, and for a time refused such work as God called them to, as Moses, <a class=\"ref\">Exodus 3:11<\/a>; Jonah, chap. 1:3, and others. <i>I gave my back to the smiters <\/i>\u2014 I patiently yielded up myself to the will of those who smote me: I was willing, not only to do, but to suffer the will of God, and the injuries of men: <i>and my cheeks to them that plucked <\/i><i>off the hair <\/i>\u2014 Which was a contumely or punishment sometimes inflicted on malefactors, <a class=\"ref\">Nehemiah 13:25<\/a>. <i>I hid not my face from shame <\/i>\u2014 From any manner of reproachful usage, but did knowingly and willingly submit myself thereunto; <i>and spitting <\/i>\u2014 Spitting in a man\u2019s face was used in token of contempt and detestation. All these things were literally fulfilled in Christ, as is expressly affirmed in the gospels; but we read of no such things concerning Isaiah, and therefore it is most safe and reasonable to understand this passage of Christ, and the rather, because it is not usual with the prophets to commend themselves so highly as the prophet here commends the person of whom he speaks.<\/p>",
