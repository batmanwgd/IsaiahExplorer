    "html": "<p> (15) Thou hast increased the nation . . .\u2014The nation is, if we follow this rendering, Israel, whose prosperity the prophet contrasts with the downfall of its oppressors (comp. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODMzXQ==\">Isaiah 9:3<\/a>). The LXX., however, gives, \u201cAdd thou evils to all the glorious ones,\u201d as if referring to the \u201cchastening\u201d of exile in the next verse, and the use of the word \u201cnation\u201d (i.e., heathen) instead of \u201cpeople,\u201d is, perhaps, in favour of this rendering. \u201cNation,\u201d however, is used for Israel in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODMzXQ==\">Isaiah 9:3<\/a> , which is partly parallel to this passage.<\/p> \n<p>Thou hadst removed it far unto all the ends of the earths\u2014Better, Thou hast moved far off the borders of the land. The English Version seems to speak of the exile and dispersion of the people. \u201cWhat is really meant is, probably, that Jehovah will restore it to its old remoter boundaries, as in the days of David and Solomon. This belongs, of course, to the ideal, and not the historical, restoration.<\/p> ",
