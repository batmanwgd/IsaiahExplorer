Thus, the prophet's language and imagery carry many implications beyond the threat of physical famine. \u2026 Removing the staff or support from a nation is analogous to suddenly taking away the props or stakes of a tent the tent collapses shapeless on the ground.\" (IPSP, 101.) In essence, Judah is threatened with a total collapse of the support products or people upon which she depends.<\/p>",
