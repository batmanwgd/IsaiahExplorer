    "html": "<p><em>For the Lord God of hosts<\/em>&mdash;Note, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NjY0XQ==\">Isaiah 1:9<\/a>.<\/p><p><em>Shall make a consumption<\/em>&mdash;The Hebrew of this verse might be rendered, &lsquo;for its destruction is completed, and is determined on; the Lord Yahweh of hosts will execute it in the midst of the land.&rsquo; Our translation, however, expresses the force of the original. It means that the destruction was fixed in the mind or purpose of God, and would be certainly executed. The translation by the Septuagint, which is followed in the main by the apostle Paul in quoting this passage, is somewhat different. &lsquo;For he will finish the work, and cut it short in righteousness, for a short work will the Lord make in the whole habitable world&rsquo;&mdash;&epsilon;\u0313&nu; &tau;&eta;\u0342\u0345 &omicron;&iota;\u0313&kappa;&omicron;&upsilon;&mu;&epsilon;\u0301&nu;&eta;\u0345 &omicron;\u0314\u0301&lambda;&eta;\u0345 en te\u0304 oikoumene\u0304 hole\u0304; as quoted by Paul, &lsquo;upon the earth&rsquo;&mdash;&epsilon;\u0313&pi;&iota;\u0300 &tau;&eta;\u0342&sigmaf; &gamma;&eta;\u0342&sigmaf; epi te\u0304s ge\u0304s.
