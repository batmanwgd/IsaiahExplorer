    "html": " <p> Isaiah envisioned the coming forth of the Book of Mormon and his prophecy presents specific events related to our keystone scripture. Isaiah's prophecy of the coming forth of the Book of Mormon describes the Prophet Joseph Smith; the three witnesses of the Book of Mormon; other witnesses; and Martin Harris's visit to Professor Anthon of New York, an acknowledged expert in ancient languages, even giving the exact words Anthon would utter.<\/p> <p> Isaiah uses the word <i>book<\/i> twenty times in this section to refer to the gold plates. This book contains \"revelation from God\" and is a record of the Jaredite and Nephite nations, those \"who have slumbered in the dust\" (JST 29:14). It is a \"sealed book,\" parts of which are kept from the wicked but which will come forth in the Lord's time to be read \"by the power of Christ\" (JST 29:16). After Joseph Smith has completed his translation of a portion of the sealed book, he will return it to God, who will \"preserve\" the record until he sees fit to bring it forth (JST 29:24).<\/p> ",
