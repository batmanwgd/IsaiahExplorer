As according to the terms of Jehovah&rsquo;s covenant the curses of the covenant come upon those who violate the rights of his people who keep the terms of his covenant, those who attempt to annihilate Jehovah&rsquo;s people are themselves annihilated in his Day of Judgment. The &ldquo;fierce blasts&rdquo; and &ldquo;east wind&rdquo; apply initially to the archtyrant who destroys the wicked and lastly to Jehovah&rsquo;s servant who delivers the righteous (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc5OTYiOjN9LHsiMTgxOTkiOjJ9LFsxODc3OV1d\">Isaiah 17:12-14; 29:5-6; 57:13<\/a>).<\/p> ",
