    "html": "<p>Although the king of Assyria\/Babylon serves Jehovah&rsquo;s purpose of inflicting covenant curses on his alienated people (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 37:26<\/a>), he seeks only his self-aggrandizement. He is that wicked one who destroys the wicked of the world in the course of conquering all lands (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 37:18<\/a>). To that end, he commits global genocide (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 33:12<\/a>). As a mass murderer, of whom the ancient kings of Assyria and Babylon provide types, he belongs to Isaiah&rsquo;s Perdition category. Isaiah depicts him under his cultic or idolatrous title &ldquo;king of Babylon&rdquo; as ultimately descending to the Pit of Dissolution (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 14:15<\/a>).<\/p>",
