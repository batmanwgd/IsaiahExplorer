Ye find - Either you indulge yourselves in sensuality, as they did, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MDY2XQ==\">Isaiah 22:13<\/a> . But this does not agree with that afflicting of their souls which they now professed, and which God acknowledges; or you pursue and satisfy your own desires: though you abstain from bodily food, you do not mortify your sinful inclinations. Exact - Your money, got by your labour, and lent to others, either for their need or your own advantage, which you require either with usury, or at least with rigour, when either the general law of charity, or God's particular law, commanded the release, or at least the forbearance of them.",
