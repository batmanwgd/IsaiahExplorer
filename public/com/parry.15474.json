Yet, despite our mortal and spiritual weakness, the Lord will support and sustain us; he will protect and defend us. Twice he states, \"I will help thee\" and twice he commands, \"Fear not\" (41:13-14).<\/p> <p><i>redeemer. <\/i>The Lord, Jesus Christ. A <i>redeemer<\/i> had a legal meaning in ancient Israel: he was responsible to take a helpless relative's obligations on his own shoulders (<a class=\"ref\">Lev. 25:25; Num. 5:8<\/a>), to avenge a murder (<a class=\"ref\">Num. 35:12; Deut. 19:6<\/a>), to care for a dead relative's widow (<a class=\"ref\">Ruth 3-4<\/a>), or to purchase one's release from debtor's prison. Such is the relationship of the Lord with us (<a class=\"ref\">Gen. 48:16<\/a>): he will care for our needs, avenge us, and release us from bondage, especially the bondage of our sins.<\/p> <p><i>Holy One of Israel.<\/i> See commentary on 1:4.<\/p> ",
