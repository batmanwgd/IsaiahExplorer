Return for Thy servants' sake, the tribes of Thine inheritance.\u201d<\/em> When men have scornfully and obstinately rejected the grace of God, God withdraws it from them judicially, gives them up to their wanderings, and makes their heart incapable of faith (<em> hiqsh\u0131\u0304a\u0306ch <\/em> , which only occurs again in <a class=\"ref\">Job 39:16<\/a>, is here equivalent to <em> hiqsha\u0302h <\/em> in <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 95:8; Deuteronomy 2:30<\/a>). The history of Israel from <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzc3MSI6MTN9\">Isaiah 6:1-13<\/a> onwards has been the history of such a gradual judgment of hardening, and such a curse, eating deeper and deeper, and spreading its influence wider and wider round. The great mass are lost, but not without the possibility of deliverance for the better part of the nation, which now appeals to the mercy of God, and sighs for deliverance from this ban. Two reasons are assigned for this petition for the return of the gracious presence of God: first, that there are still \u201cservants of Jehovah\u201d to be found, as this prayer itself actually proves; and secondly, that the divine election of grace cannot perish. <\/p>",
