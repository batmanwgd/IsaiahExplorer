The nations made servants of Israel, but now their kings will minister unto Israel and their children (49:7, 23; 61:4). To this prophecy of Isaiah, Joseph Smith added one of his own, giving an application for his generation: \"I now deliver it as a prophecy, if the inhabitants of this state, with the people of the surrounding country, will turn unto the Lord with all their hearts, ten years will not roll around before the kings and queens of the earth will come unto Zion, and pay their respects to the leaders of this people; they shall come with their millions, and shall contribute of their abundance for the relief of the poor, and the building up and beautifying of Zion.\" Unfortunately, the people did not meet the required condition and thus the prophecy could not be fulfilled.<\/p> ",
