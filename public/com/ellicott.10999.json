(Comp. \u201cthe firstborn of death\u201d in <a class=\"ref\">Job 18:13<\/a>.) The people spoken of are those of Judah, which in the days of Ahaz had been \u201cbrought very low\u201d (<a class=\"ref\">2 Chronicles 28:19<\/a>). For these the prophet foretells a time of plenty; not so for Philistia. Either through the sieges of their towns or the devastation of their fields, they would be reduced to the last extremities of famine. With them there should be no \u201cremnant\u201d to return. <\/p> ",
