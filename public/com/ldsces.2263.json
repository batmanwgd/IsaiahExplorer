    "html": " <p>The kingdom of Israel (Ephraim) in the north had formed an alliance with Syria for mutual strength and protection against the conquering empire of Assyria. When Judah refused to join the alliance, they threatened to subjugate Judah and attacked their southern foe. (see <a class=\"ref\">2 Kings 15:36&ndash;38; 16:1&ndash;6 <\/a>). <\/p> <p>Isaiah was directed to warn King Ahaz against seeking political alliances for Judah in order to defend his people. The king, the third of the kings of Judah that Isaiah was sent to counsel, eventually rejected the Lord&rsquo;s warning (see <a class=\"ref\">2 Kings 16:7&ndash;20 <\/a>; see also Enrichment F. <\/p> <p class=\"cite\"> LDS Church Educational System Old Testament Student Manual, 1 Kings&ndash;Malachi, Religion 302, Chapter 13, Item 39 <\/p> ",
