    "html": " <p>Parallel phrases define Zion as &ldquo;those of her who repent.&rdquo; That is, those of Jehovah&rsquo;s people&mdash;his wife within the marriage covenant&mdash;who repent. As we observe in a repeat definition, Zion represents that category of his people to whom Jehovah comes to reign: &ldquo;He will come as Redeemer to Zion, to those of Jacob who repent of transgression&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODIxXQ==\">Isaiah 59:20 <\/a>). While those whom Isaiah identifies as Jacob or Israel represent a category of believers in God, those whom he identifies as Zion or Jerusalem represent a higher spiritual category, namely persons who repent of transgression&mdash;not all Israel. <\/p> <p> <em>Justice... <strong>righteousness <\/strong>,. <\/em>,The reestablishment of justice and righteousness qualifies Jehovah&rsquo;s people for deliverance from destruction in Jehovah&rsquo;s Day of Judgment. To that end, Jehovah sends his servant, who personifies <em>righteousness <\/em>,, to restore justice in the earth and to serve as an exemplar of righteousness (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODQ1NF0seyIxODQ4MiI6NH0seyIxODU5OCI6M31d\">Isaiah 41:2; 42:1-4; 46:11-13 <\/a>). While the verb &ldquo;ransomed&rdquo; (<em>pdh <\/em>) applies largely to the physical deliverance of Jehovah&rsquo;s people, its synonym &ldquo;redeemed&rdquo; (<em>g&rsquo;l <\/em>) applies to their spiritual salvation (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NTU2XQ==\">Isaiah 44:22 <\/a>). In effect, he who &ldquo;redeems&rdquo; is Jehovah, while he who &ldquo;ransoms&rdquo; is his servant. <\/p>,",
