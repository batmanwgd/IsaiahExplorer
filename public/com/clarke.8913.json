For my own part I am inclined to think that the text is much corrupted in this place. The ancient Versions have not the least traces of either of the above interpretations. The Septuagint and Syriac agree exactly together in rendering this line by, \"As the wax melted before the fire,\" which can by no means be reconciled with the present text.
