Joseph Smith assured us that when we begin to see signs, we may be confident that <i>all<\/i> that the Lord has prophesied will be fulfilled: \"We see that perilous times have come, as was testified of. We may look, then, with most perfect assurance, for the fulfillment of all those things that have been written, and with more confidence than ever before, lift up our eyes to the luminary of day, and say in our hearts, Soon thou wilt veil thy blushing face.\" <\/p> <p><i>heavens shall vanish.<\/i> Though the heavens and the earth as we know them seem permanent, both will vanish, or \"pass away,\" when the Lord comes again in glory; they will be replaced by new heavens (<a class=\"ref\">2 Pet. 3:10; 3 Ne. 26:3<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 45:22<\/a>) and a new earth. Though both heavens and earth will pass away, the Lord's salvation continues forever.<\/p> <p><i>like smoke.<\/i> Smoke is visible in the air only briefly and then vanishes (<a class=\"ref\">Ps. 37:20; 68:2<\/a>; <a class=\"ref\"> 102:3<\/a>). <\/p> <p><i>earth shall wax old like a garment.<\/i> It is part of Latter-day Saint theology that the earth is a living being with a spirit and body and that it will die and then be resurrected. Though heaven and earth will pass away, just as all clothing deteriorates and then disintegrates, the Lord and his righteousness continue forever (50:9; <a class=\"ref\">Ps. 102:25-<\/a> 27; <a class=\"ref\">Heb. 1:10-12; 2 Ne. 8:7-8<\/a>). <\/p> ",
