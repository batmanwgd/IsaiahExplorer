Petersen-as the whole land of Canaan, which was given to the house of Israel. Elder Mark E. Petersen has pointed out that Isaiah said a sacred book was to <i>come<\/i> forth before Palestine would become a fertile land, and that Palestine is now a fertile land (see CR, Oct. 1970, p. 142; see also CR, Oct. 1965, p. 61). President Joseph Fielding Smith cited the change which has come upon Palestine, since the coming forth of the Book of Mormon, through irrigation and cultivation of the land (see DS, 3:260-61). Elder Orson Pratt gave a further interpretation of this verse:<\/p>     <blockquote>The book, therefore, that Isaiah prophesies of, is to come forth just before the great day of the restoration of Israel to their own lands; at which time Lebanon and all the land of Canaan is again to be blessed, while the fruitful field occupied by the nations of the Gentiles, 'will be esteemed as a forest;' the multitude of the nations of the Gentiles are to perish, and their lands which are now like a fruitful field, are to be left desolate of inhabitants and become as Lebanon has been for many generations past; while Lebanon shall again be occupied by Israel, and be turned into a fruitful field. These great events could not take place until the Lord should first bring forth a book out of the ground. (Works, pp. 276-77.)<\/blockquote>     ",
