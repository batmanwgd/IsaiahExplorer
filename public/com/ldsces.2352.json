McConkie defined <em>spiritual deafness <\/em> as &ldquo;the state of those who are lacking in spirituality, whose spirit ears are not attuned to the whisperings of the still small voice of the Spirit. Similarly, <em>spiritual blindness <\/em> is the identifying mark which singles out those who are unable to see the hand of God manifest in the affairs of men. Such have &lsquo;unbelief and blindness of heart&rsquo; (<a class=\"ref\">D. &amp; C. 58:15 <\/a>); they are &lsquo;hard in their hearts, and blind in their minds.&rsquo; (<a class=\"ref\">3 Ne. 2:1 <\/a>.)&rdquo; (<em>Mormon Doctrine, <\/em> p. 184.) <\/p> <p class=\"cite\"> LDS Church Educational System Old Testament Student Manual, 1 Kings&ndash;Malachi, Religion 302, Chapter 15, Item 20 <\/p> ",
