See <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTg2OTI=\">Isaiah 51:18<\/a>; <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTg2OTQ=\">Isaiah 51:20<\/a>. <i>By whom shall I comfort thee <\/i>\u2014 What human means of comfort is there left for thee?<\/p>\n<p><i>Thy sons have fainted <\/i>\u2014 They are so far from being able to comfort thee, as was said <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"MTg2OTI=\">Isaiah 51:18<\/a>, that they themselves faint away for want of comfort, and through famine. <i>They lie at the head of all the streets <\/i>\u2014 Dead by famine, or the sword of the enemy; <i>as a wild bull in a net <\/i>\u2014 Those of them who are not slain are struggling for life. <i>They are full of the fury of the Lord <\/i>\u2014 \u201cThe bold image of the cup of God\u2019s wrath,\u201d says Bishop Lowth, \u201coften employed by the sacred writers, is nowhere handled with greater force and sublimity than in this passage. Jerusalem is represented in person, as staggering under the effects of it, destitute of that assistance which she might expect from her children, not one of them being able to support or lead her. They, abject and amazed, lie at the head of every street, overwhelmed with the greatness of their distress; like the oryx entangled in a net, in vain struggling to rend it and extricate himself. This is poetry of the first order, sublimity of the highest proof.\u201d<\/p>",
