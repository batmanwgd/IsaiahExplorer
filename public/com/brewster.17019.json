    "html": "<p><b>(<a class=\"ref\">2 Nephi 24:32<\/a>).<\/b>\"<i>That the Lord hath founded Zion, and the poor of his people shall trust in it.<\/i>\" This is the answer to the question raised in the first part of the verse. God will not tolerate wicked people or nations. His desire is to establish the <i>standard of Zion<\/i> in every heart, home, village, and nation throughout the world. Among other things, this standard calls for the \"pure in heart\" to \"dwell in righteousness\" and to see that there is \"no poor among them.\" (See <a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 97:21; Moses 7:18<\/a>.) In such a place there is no contention, envying, disharmony, or distrust, for the love of God will dwell in the hearts of each one. (See <a class=\"ref\">4 Nephi 1:2-3, 12-13, 15-16<\/a>.) This is the environment in which the poor or afflicted can seek refuge both physically and spiritually. They can trust in the standard of Zion! <\/p>",
