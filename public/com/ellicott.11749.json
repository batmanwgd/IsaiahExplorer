The bread of the Jews seems to have been made always in the thin oval cakes, which were naturally broken rather than cut.<\/p> \n<p>The poor that are cast out.\u2014The words include all forms of homelessness\u2014tenants evicted by their landlords, debtors by their creditors, slaves fleeing from their masters\u2019 cruelty, the persecuted for righteousness\u2019 sake, perhaps even political refugees. Note the parallelism with <a class=\"ref\">Matthew 25:35-36<\/a>.<\/p> \n<p>From thine own flesh.\u2014Usage, as in <a class=\"ref\">Genesis 29:14; Nehemiah 5:5<\/a> , leads us to refer the words primarily to suffering Israelites, but those who have learnt that \u201cGod hath made of one blood all the nations of the earth\u201d ( <a class=\"ref\">Acts 17:26<\/a>) will extend its range to every form of suffering humanity.<\/p> ",
