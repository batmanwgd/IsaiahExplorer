The expression is strong and elegant. Bishop Lowth, however, interprets the clause, \u201cYet will I bring more evils upon Dimon,\u201d that is, though the waters are full of blood, yet will I bring upon them further and greater evils. <i>Lions upon him that escapeth of Moab,<\/i> &c.\u2014This is the fourth evil, the completion of all the rest, and the severest cause of their lamentation, that God would not even spare a remnant hereafter to restore and renew their fallen state; but would pursue them with his judgments to the last extremity, and send upon them, and on their desolate country, lions and other wild beasts, entirely to destroy all that remained. Vitringa, however, thinks that Nebuchadnezzar is pointed out in this clause; who, after the Moabites, reduced extremely low by the Assyrians, began to recruit themselves, should give the remnant of the nation to destruction, and complete the judgment which the Assyrian had begun: see <a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 4:7; Jeremiah 5:6; Jeremiah 48:40<\/a>. The Chaldee paraphrast must have so understood it, translating the word, which we render<i>lion,<\/i> by<i>king: A king with his army to destroy the Moabites. <\/i><\/p> ",
