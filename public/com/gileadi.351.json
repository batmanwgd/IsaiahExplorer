    "html": "<p>Jehovah assures the Zion\/Jerusalem category of his people that the adversity they endure is but for a small moment. He hears their cries as he heard their ancestors who were in bondage in Egypt (<a class=\"ref\">Exodus 3:7-9<\/a>). As Moses and Hezekiah interceded with Jehovah on behalf of their peoples, so does his servant&mdash;their <em>voice<\/em>. Soon they will see Jehovah who will personally teach them: &ldquo;Strengthen the hands grown feeble, steady the failing knees. Say to those with fearful hearts, &lsquo;Take courage, be unafraid! See, your God is coming to avenge and to reward; God himself will come and deliver you&rsquo;&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgzMjQiOjJ9XQ==\">Isaiah 35:3-4<\/a>).<\/p>",
