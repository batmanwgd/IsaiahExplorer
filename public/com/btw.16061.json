Isaiah sees the Lord upon his throne. He feels unqualified but is cleansed and offers, \"Here am I, send me.\" The people will harden their hearts against his message, but he must continue to cry repentance. Eventually a remnant of the house of Israel will return from captivity.  <\/p>  <h4>Dividing the Tree of 2 Nephi 16 into Branches<\/h4>  <ul>  <li>  1\u20134: Isaiah's vision of the Lord <\/li>  <li>  5\u20138: Isaiah's call to the ministry <\/li>  <li>  9\u201313: Isaiah's rejection foretold, but a remnant shall return  <\/li>  <\/ul>    ",
