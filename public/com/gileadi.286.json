Cosmic cataclysm&mdash;when &ldquo;the earth shall shake to its foundation&rdquo;&mdash;signals the start of an onslaught of covenant curses that befall the wicked and from which there appears no escape ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzkyMCI6M30=\">Isaiah 13:13-15<\/a>). Isaiah uses assonance and alliteration to depict the &ldquo;terrors&rdquo; (<em>pahad<\/em>), &ldquo;pitfalls&rdquo; (<em>pahat<\/em>), and &ldquo;traps&rdquo; (<em>pah<\/em>) that spread pervasively throughout the earth, reflecting a point of no return for its inhabitants until the entire cycle of deliverance and destruction has fulfilled its purpose.<\/p> ",
