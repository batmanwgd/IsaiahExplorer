    "html": " <i>acceptable time\/day of salvation.<\/i> This phrase speaks of the period and the specific time when the Lord chooses to do his work. At least one fulfillment of this expression came in the meridian dispensation, when Paul wrote, \"Behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation\" (<a class=\"ref\">2 Cor. 6:2<\/a>). Another time of fulfillment appears to be the last days, when Israel is gathered.<\/p> <p><i>my servant for a covenant.<\/i> The existence and work of the servant is a sign that God is fulfilling his covenant with the people (42:6-7; see commentary on 49:1, <i>hath<\/i> <i>called<\/i> <i>me,<\/i> for the possible identity of the servant).<\/p> <p><i>establish the earth.<\/i> The New International Version and the Jerusalem Bible translate this phrase as \"restore the land\": Israel's rightful inheritance will be restored to her. The Lord's people\u2014and his servant\u2014will establish his kingdom in the earth.<\/p> <p><i>inherit the desolate heritages.<\/i> Israel will inherit her promised land, though it has been made desolate. <i>Desolate<\/i> often refers to the destruction of the temple\u2014the blessings of which will be restored to the Lord's people.<\/p> ",
