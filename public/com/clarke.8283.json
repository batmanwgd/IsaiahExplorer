This conqueror did not ruin Moab so completely as not to leave a man in the land; the final desolation of Moab was reserved for Nebuchadnezzar, five years after the taking of Jerusalem.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>Feeble \"And without strength\"\u2014<\/em>An ancient MS., with the Septuagint, reads <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">\u05d5\u05dc\u05d0 <\/span>   <span class=\"translit\">velo<\/span>, \"and not.\"<\/p>",
