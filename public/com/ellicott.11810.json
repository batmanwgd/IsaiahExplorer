    "html": "<p> (4) Thou shalt no more be termed Forsaken . . .\u2014The change of name is here partially indicated, and probably finds its starting-point in the marriage of Hezekiah with Hephzi-bah (<a class=\"ref\">2 Kings 21:1<\/a>), which, on the assumption of Isaiah\u2019s authorship of these chapters, would be fresh in the prophet\u2019s memory. It would be entirely after his manner to see in the bride\u2019s name, as in those of his own sons, an omen of the future. The fact that the Hebrew word for Forsaken (Azubah) had been borne by a previous queen, the mother of Jehoshaphat (<a class=\"ref\">1 Kings 22:42<\/a>), confirms the view here taken. \u201cHephzi-bah\u201d means \u201cmy delight is in her;\u201d and \u201cBeulah,\u201d \u201cmarried.\u201d<\/p> ",
