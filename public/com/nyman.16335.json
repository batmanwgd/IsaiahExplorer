While this verse has been interpreted by some as a prophecy of plural marriage in the Church, a close examination will show that it refers to the world, not the Church. The offer of marriage as described by Isaiah is not in keeping with the law of plural marriage as revealed in the Doctrine and Covenants. The proposal to marry (or merely live together) is made here by the woman. Under the Lord's law, the man would initiate the marriage (see <a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 132:58-61<\/a>).

The innate desire of the woman to be a wife and a mother is noted in the phrase \"to take away our reproach.\" To be childless was considered a reproach in ancient Israel (see <a class=\"ref\">Luke 1:25<\/a> and <a class=\"ref\">Gen. 30:23<\/a>).<\/p>     ",
