Isaiah asks the Lord to help them to return to their promised inheritance.<\/p> <p><i>for thy servants' sake.<\/i> This phrase means \"for the sake of those who are faithful.\" Even though many of the covenant people have turned to sin, Isaiah asks that the Lord remember his promises to them because of the worthiness of a few. This is the same argument Abraham made when the Lord informed him of the pending destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah (<a class=\"ref\">Gen. 18:23-24,  26<\/a>). <\/p> ",
