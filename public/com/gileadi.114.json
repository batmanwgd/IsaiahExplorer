    "html": "<p>By addressing Ahaz as &ldquo;the house of David,&rdquo; Isaiah reminds Ahaz verbally, not just symbolically, of his duty toward his people under the terms of the Davidic Covenant. At the same time, he rebukes Ahaz for his people&rsquo;s suffering under his oppressive rule. In addition, Isaiah alters the covenant formula &ldquo;your God&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3OTQwXQ==\">v 11<\/a>) to &ldquo;my God,&rdquo; inferring that by rejecting Jehovah&rsquo;s word Ahaz has rejected his God, breaking the terms of the Davidic Covenant. Meanwhile, the presence of Isaiah&rsquo;s son Shear-Jashub (&ldquo;A Remnant Shall Return&rdquo;) symbolically predicts the consequences of Ahaz&rsquo; recalcitrance.<\/p>",
