    "html": "<p>From a historical perspective, the events Isaiah predicted &ldquo;indeed came to pass.&rdquo; As determined by the synchronous literary structures that transform the events of Isaiah&rsquo;s day into an allegory of the end-time, however, a second fulfillment is imminent. Not only does Jehovah &ldquo;foretell&rdquo; and &ldquo;declare&rdquo; this in the historical fulfillment of Isaiah&rsquo;s prophecy itself&mdash;wherein Israel&rsquo;s history serves as a series of types and foreshadowings of the end-time (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 44:7; 46:10<\/a>)&mdash;but Jehovah&rsquo;s servant additionally foretells &ldquo;new things&rdquo; before they occur as a proof that Jehovah is with him (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 44:26; 48:3-16<\/a>).<\/p>",
