    "title": "Why Was Isaiah Made So Sorrowful by His Vision?",
    "html": "<p>The pain caused by the vision given to Isaiah was so intense that its descriptive words in Hebrew portray his condition to be more than mere sorrow: &ldquo;<em>Chalchalah<\/em> is the contortion produced by cramp, as in Nahum ii. 11;<em>tzirim<\/em> is the word properly applied to the pains of childbirth;<em>na avah<\/em> means to bend, or bow one&rsquo;s self, and is also used to denote a convulsive utterance of pain;<em>ta ah,<\/em> which is used in a different sense from Ps. xcv. 10 (compare, however, Ps. xxxviii. 11), denotes a feverish and irregular beating of the pulse. The darkness of evening and night, which the prophet loved so much (<em>cheshek,<\/em> a desire arising from inclination, 1 Kings ix. 1, 19), and always longed for, either that he might give himself up to contemplation, or that he might rest from outward and inward labour, had been changed into quaking by the horrible vision.&rdquo; (Keil and Delitzsch,<em>Commentary,<\/em> 7:1:379.)<\/p><p>The destruction of Babylon was not a pleasant thing to behold. But some commentators believe that here again Isaiah saw another destruction, the destruction of the Babylon of the world before the advent of the Lord Jesus Christ in the last days. Although necessary, this destruction would be a great tragedy.<\/p><p>The description of the many asses and camels and horsemen seems to refer to the physical trappings of the Persian Army. The animals provided useful carriage for food and implements of war but were also effectively used by the Persians &ldquo;to throw the enemy into confusion&rdquo; (Keil and Delitzsch,<em>Commentary,<\/em> 7:1:381).<\/p><p class=\"cite\"> LDS Church Educational System Old Testament Student Manual, 1 Kings&ndash;Malachi, Religion 302, Chapter 14, Item 34<\/p> ",
