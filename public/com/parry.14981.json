The plants and sprigs that Israel plants represent none other than Israel herself in her apostate condition.<\/p> <p><i>harvest shall be a heap in the day of grief and of desperate sorrow.<\/i> Israel should be a choice vine that relies upon Jesus Christ for life and power (<a class=\"ref\">John 15<\/a>) its fruits should be plump and nourishing. Instead, Israel has become a wild, inferior, and unfruitful vine. The harvest of rotten produce, therefore, will be cast into a great <i>heap.<\/i> This is why God should be the planter and the keeper of the vineyard (<a class=\"ref\">Jacob 5-<\/a> 6): if the people of Israel had permitted God to become the focus of their lives, they would have produced good fruits (<a class=\"ref\">3 Ne. 14:17-18<\/a>). <\/p> ",
