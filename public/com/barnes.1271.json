This refers to the mode in which God said He would instruct them in a foreign land. They had complained <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODE3NCI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 28:9-10<\/a> that his instructions had been like a short lesson constantly repeated, as we instruct children.

God will so deal out the lessons of his judgment and wrath, that as a people they shall be broken up, and made prisoners, and be borne to a distant land.<\/p> ",
