Prophesy not unto us right things <\/i>\u2014 The prophets told them of their faults, and warned them of their misery and danger, but they could not bear it. They wanted <i>smooth things <\/i>to be spoken to them, things that would give them no pain, but please their corrupt minds, and flatter them in their sins. <i>Get ye out of the way <\/i>\u2014 In which you now walk, out of your present course of preaching unpleasing and frightful things; or, out of our way. For the prophets stood in their way, like the angel in Balaam\u2019s road, with the sword of God\u2019s wrath drawn in their hands, so that these sinners could not proceed on in their sinful practices without terror; and this they took heinously. <i>Cause the Holy One of Israel to cease from before us <\/i>\u2014 Do not trouble us with harsh and repeated messages from God, as you use to do.<\/p>",
