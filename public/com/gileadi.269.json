    "html": "<p>As an allegory that prefigures an end-time fulfillment, this dramatization of a presumptuous servant&rsquo;s demise paints a painful picture of how one who rises to a position of privilege among Jehovah&rsquo;s people falls and becomes a disgrace. The higher the authority Jehovah bestows on an individual&mdash;for the purpose of fulfilling an honorable stewardship in his house&mdash;the greater the paradox when that person forgets he is called for others&rsquo; sake, not his own. When he considers himself entitled and offends God, Jehovah&rsquo;s justice requires him to release that person from office and to appoint another in his stead.<\/p>",
