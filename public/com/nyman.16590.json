This idea is supported by the Lord's invitation for the people to gather out from the gentile nations to Zion, and for the Jews to gather to Jerusalem, as outlined in <a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 133:7-13<\/a> (wherein verse 9 paraphrases <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzI2XQ==\">Isaiah 54:2<\/a>). Moroni also paraphrased verse 2 in his final admonition to Jerusalem and Zion as he closed the Book of Mormon record (see <a class=\"ref\">Moro. 10:31<\/a>). The concept of a tent with its cords and stakes comes from the tent or tabernacle of Moses, and all Israel is being invited to seek shelter under it. The stakes are thus the strongholds surrounding Zion, or Jackson County. They are also a \"refuge from the storm\" and from the wrath of God which will be poured out upon the world (see <a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 115:6; Isaiah 4:5-6<\/a>).<\/p>     ",
