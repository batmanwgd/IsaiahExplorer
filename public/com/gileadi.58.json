While the parallel terms &ldquo;babes&rdquo; and &ldquo;women&rdquo; may be intended literally, they undoubtedly convey a caricature of men who are spiritually immature or less than men in their personal lives. Their oppressive leadership in &ldquo;misleading&rdquo; Jehovah&rsquo;s people&mdash;&ldquo;abolishing&rdquo; well-proven principles and established guidelines&mdash;causes their society to disintegrate, leaving them vulnerable to disaster (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzg0NiI6NH0=\">Isaiah 9:16-19<\/a>). <\/p> ",
