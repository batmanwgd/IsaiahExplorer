    "html": " <p> (11) Lord, how long?\u2014The prophet asks the question which is ever on the lips of those who are brought face to face with the problems of the world, with the great mystery of evil, sin permitted to work out fresh evil as its punishment, and yet remaining evil. How long shall all this last? So a later prophet, towards the close of the seventy years of exile, cried once again, \u201cHow long?\u201d (<a class=\"ref\">Daniel 8:13<\/a>). So the cry, \u201cHow long, O Lord, dost thou not judge?\u201d came from the souls beneath the altar (<a class=\"ref\">Revelation 6:10<\/a>). <\/p> \n <p>Until the cities be wasted without inhabitant.\u2014The words answer the immediate question of the prophet within its horizon. They suggest an answer to all analogous questions. Stroke after stroke must come, judgment after judgment, till the sin has been adequately punished; but the darkness of the prospect, terrible as it is, does not exclude the glimmer of an eternal hope for the far-off future. <\/p> ",
