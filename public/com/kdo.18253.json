    "html": "<p> The following clause gives the reason for this; \u05d5 being very frequently the logical equivalent for <em> k\u0131\u0304 <\/em> (e.g., <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc2NTYiOjMxfSxbMTg1ODNdXQ==\">, or a lost book, as Origen imagined (see Tischendorf's ed. vii. of the N.T. on this passage). This which no ear has heard, no eye seen, is not God Himself, but He who acts for His people, and justifies their waiting for Him (cf., Hofmann, <em> Die h. Schrift Neuen Testaments<\/em> , ii. 2, 51). Another proof that Paul had no other passage than this in his mind, is the fact that the same quotation is met with in Clement's <em> Epistle to the Corinthians<\/em> (ch. 34), where, instead of \u201cthose that love Him,\u201d we have \u201cthose that wait for Him,\u201d a literal rendering of \u05dc\u05de\u05d7\u05db\u05bc\u05d4\u05be\u05dc\u05d5 . The quotation by Paul therefore by no means leads us to take <em> Elohim <\/em> as a vocative or \u05d5\u05d2\u05d5 \u05d9\u05e2\u05e9\u05c2\u05d4 as the object, although it must not be concealed that this view of the passage and its reference to the fulness of glory in the eternal life is an old rabbinical one, as Rashi expressly affirms, when he appeals to R. Jose (Joseph Kara) as bondsman for the other (see <em> b. Sanhedrin <\/em> 99<em> a<\/em> ). Hahn has justly objected to this traditional explanation, which regards Elohim as a vocative, that the thought, that God alone has heard and perceived and seen with His eye what He intends to do to His people, is unsuitable in itself, and at variance with the context, and that if \u05d5\u05d2\u05d5 \u05d9\u05e2\u05e9\u05c2\u05d4 was intended as the object, \u05d0\u05e9\u05e8 ( \u05d0\u05ea ) would certainly be inserted. And to this we may add, that we cannot find the words <em> Elohim <\/em> <em> zu\u0304la\u0302th e kha\u0302 <\/em> (God beside Thee) preceded by a negation anywhere in chapters 40-66 without receiving at once the impression, that they affirm the sole deity of Jehovah (comp. <a class=\"isa\">Isaiah 45:5, Isaiah 45:21<\/a>). The meaning therefore is, <em> \u201cNo other God beside Jehovah has ever been heard or seen, who acted for <\/em> (<em> ageret pro <\/em> )<em> those who waited for Him.\u201d<\/em> <em> M e chakke\u0304h <\/em> is the construct, according to Ges. \u00a7116, 1; and <em> ya\u201ba\u0306se\u0304h <\/em> has <em> tsere<\/em> here, according to Kimchi (<em> Michlol<\/em> 125<em> b<\/em> ) and other testimonies, just as we meet with \u05ea\u05e2\u05e1\u05d4 four times (in <a class=\"ref\">Genesis 26:29; Joshua 7:9; 2 Samuel 13:12; Jeremiah 40:16<\/a>) and \u05d5\u05e0\u05e2\u05e9\u05c2\u05d4 once (<a class=\"ref\">Joshua 9:24<\/a>), mostly with a disjunctive accent, and not without the influence of a whole or half pause, the form with <em> tsere<\/em> being regarded as more emphatic than that with <em> seghol<\/em> .<\/p><p> (Note: In addition to the examples given above, we have the following forms of the same kind in kal: \u05d9\u05de\u05bc\u05e6\u05d4 (with <em> tiphchah<\/em> ) in <a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 17:17<\/a>; \u05ea\u05bc\u05e8\u05d0\u05d4 (with <em> tsakpeh<\/em> ) in <a class=\"ref\">Daniel 1:13<\/a>, compare \u05ea\u05bc\u05d2\u05dc\u05bc\u05d4 (with <em> athnach<\/em> ) in <a class=\"ref\">Leviticus 18:7-8<\/a>, and \u05ea\u05d2\u05dc\u05bc\u05d4 (with the smaller disjunctive <em> tiphchah<\/em> ) in <a class=\"ref\">Leviticus 18:9-11<\/a>; \u05d9\u05e0\u05e7\u05bc\u05d4 (with <em> athnach<\/em> ) in <a class=\"ref\">Nahum 1:3<\/a>; \u05d0\u05d6\u05e8\u05d4 (with <em> tsakeph<\/em> ) in <a class=\"ref\">Ezekiel 5:12<\/a>. This influence of the accentuation has escaped the notice of the more modern grammarians (e.g., Ges. \u00a775, Anm. 17).)<\/p>",
