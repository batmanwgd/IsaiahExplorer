    "html": "<p>The abject futility of idol worship becomes clear as Isaiah&rsquo;s parody proceeds to its deplorable conclusion. How often must Jehovah continue to remind his people to worship him, not the gods of the heathen: &ldquo;&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t go after other gods to serve them or worship them. Don&rsquo;t provoke me to anger with the works of your hands and I will do you no harm. Yet you haven&rsquo;t listened to me,&rsquo; says Jehovah, &lsquo;so as not to provoke me to anger with the works of your hands&rsquo;&rdquo; ( <a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 25:6-7<\/a>). In spite of Jehovah&rsquo;s admonitions, his people&rsquo;s addiction to idolatry enslaves them to a counterfeit of happiness.<\/p> ",
