Rather than telling what he knows, the servant responds by turning their hearts from him toward their God, suggesting they should spend the current duration of time for what Jehovah intended: &ldquo;by repenting and coming back.&rdquo; Then they would know for themselves that the &ldquo;morning&rdquo;&mdash;the millennial age&mdash;is drawing near but that Jehovah&rsquo;s Day of Judgment hasn&rsquo;t yet served its purpose.<\/p> ",
