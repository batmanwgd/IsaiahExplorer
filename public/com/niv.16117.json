We have already seen a number of brief examples, such as the wounded body and abandoned lean-to of chapter 1. We have also seen a longer example in 3:16\u20134:1, where Jerusalem is compared to a beautiful and haughty woman. Here, in one sense, the author sums up everything he has said thus far in one powerful image. This image of the vineyard would have special poignancy for the Judean audience that Isaiah is addressing, because grapes is the crop that grows best in Judah.<\/p>     <p>\u2003But, as the illustration makes plain, a grape crop demands a great deal of preparation and care. The land must first be cleared of other plants and then of the rocks that the Judean hillsides produce in abundance (v. 2). This is the work of an entire year. Then the finest vines that one can afford must be purchased and carefully set out. During that second year the cleared rocks must be built into fences and watchtowers in order to keep out marauders, both four-footed and two-footed. Finally, in the third year, the fruit of all the previous labor is ready.<\/p>     <p>\u2003It is easy to imagine the Judean farmers being right with the speaker as they anticipate the sweet harvest. And it is also possible to imagine their outrage when they are told that for all that effort, the outcome is only bitter grapes (v. 2). So when Isaiah announces that he is going to tear down the wall and let the wild animals in and even pray the heavens to stop raining on that vineyard (vv. 5\u20136), we can imagine the hearers shouting, \u201cYes, do it!\u201d<\/p>     ",
