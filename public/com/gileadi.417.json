His second response is to enlist the help of Jehovah&rsquo;s prophet Isaiah who undoubtedly served as his long-time mentor. Of Hezekiah it is thus written: &ldquo;He trusted in Jehovah the God of Israel, so that after him there was no one like him of all the kings of Judah, nor any before him. For he adhered to Jehovah and digressed not from following him, but he kept his commandments as Jehovah had commanded Moses&rdquo; (<a class=\"ref\">2 Kings 18:5-6<\/a>). <\/p> ",
