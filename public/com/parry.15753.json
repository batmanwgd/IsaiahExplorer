Other versions of the Bible give the words <i>dumbfounded<\/i> and <i>appalled.<\/i><\/p> <p> <i>visage&hellip;marred\/form.<\/i> The servant will be greatly disfigured by his sufferings, both in face and in body (<a class=\"ref\">Job 19:13-22<\/a>). Certainly the pain that Jesus suffered in the Garden of Gethsemane was so great that it could be said that \"his visage\" would be \"marred more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men.\"<\/p> <p>Elder Bruce R. McConkie wrote: \"Isaiah's prophecy about the marred servant is clearly Messianic and applies to Jesus who was crucified and rose from the dead to sprinkle the saving power of his blood in all nations. It is of him that kings shall shut their mouths as they ponder the marvel of his resurrection and all that he did. (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODcxMCI6M30=\">Isa. 52:13-15<\/a>.) But in this whole discourse [to the Nephites (<a class=\"ref\">3 Ne. 20:10-22<\/a>:17 Jesus is applying the prophetic word to the latter days, meaning that, as with many prophecies, the divine word has a dual fulfillment. In this setting we may properly say that Joseph Smith\u2014whose voice declared the word for this dispensation\u2014was marred, as his Lord had been, and yet should be healed, in the eternal sense, as was his Lord. And it may yet well be that there will be other latter-day servants to whom also it will apply.\" <\/p> <p><i>more than the sons of men.<\/i> The marring or disfiguration of the \"visage\" of the servant will be to a greater degree than all other mortals. The Savior's suffering was more than we can comprehend.<\/p> ",
