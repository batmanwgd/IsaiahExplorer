    "html": "<p>Chapter 8 continues the developments of <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzc4NCI6MjV9\">ch. 7<\/a> in the light of the Syro-Ephraimite crisis. There the sign and its explanation were primarily for Ahaz and the house of David. Here a very similar sign is put before the people as a whole. Here too the sign has a double implication. On the one hand it is a message of hope and confidence (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzgxMSI6Mn0=\">vv. 3, 4<\/a>), but on the other it is also one of impending doom (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzgxMyI6NH0=\">vv. 5\u20138<\/a>). Nonetheless, and here the materials of <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzgwOSI6MjJ9\">ch. 8<\/a> go beyond those of <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzc4NCI6MjV9\">ch. 7<\/a>, the coming doom is within God\u2019s purposes, and he will not give the devouring nations permission to run amok indefinitely (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzgxNyI6Mn0=\">vv. 9, 10<\/a>). The concluding section of the chapter (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzgxOSI6MTJ9\">vv. 11\u201322<\/a>) consists of wider theological reflection upon the whole experience. It is the nation\u2019s general inability to believe that God could be involved in their daily affairs which has landed them where they are. If they had paid as much attention to God as to the supposed conspiracies of their neighbors, if they had sought God\u2019s will as earnestly as they had endeavored to divine the future through magical means, then they would not be sinking into the darkness as rapidly as they were. As throughout this segment, the question remains, \u201cIs God really with us?\u201d Isaiah knows it, but king and people alike have difficulty believing it.<\/p> <p>The similarity of 8:1\u20134 to 7:10\u201317 is too close to be coincidental. The relation of the sign to the birth and naming of a child is the same, even to the use of the same language (\u201cshe shall conceive and bear a son,\u201d 7:14; \u201cshe conceived and bore a son,\u201d 8:3). Moreover, the significance of the signs is the same: before the child reaches a certain age, Samaria and Damascus will cease to be a threat to Judah. These similarities have prompted some writers to conclude that it is these events to which 7:10\u201317 (at least initially) refers. This seems highly likely in that it satisfies the demand of those verses for some specific fulfillment of that prophecy during Ahaz\u2019s time. Furthermore, the occurrence of the name Immanuel in 8:8 and an allusion to it in 8:10 argue that 7:10\u20138:10 constitutes a unit dealing with the Immanuel theme. This is not to say that Maher-shalal-hash-baz in any way exhausts or completes the Immanuel motif. In fact, it is evident that he does not, for Assyria will destroy not only Damascus and Samaria, she will sweep on into Judah. Obviously, then, the unfolding of the actuality of God\u2019s presence waits some larger personage than the son of the prophet. Nevertheless, in the light of the fulfillment of the events that his name symbolized, Maher-shalal-hash-baz was a strong interim reminder that God\u2019s immanence is the one factor which ought to influence all our plans.<\/p> <p><a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODA5XQ==\">1<\/a> The prophet speaks now in the first person, as throughout the chapter. Isaiah himself is becoming a part of the process of signs that God is giving his people (v. 18). No longer is the encounter on a formal level between a king and a prophet. It is now on a personal level as Isaiah comes face to face with the hardness of his people. Even if he wished to do so, he cannot remain aloof.<\/p> <p><i>Take for yourself a large tablet.<\/i> Evidently God\u2019s intent here is that anyone should be able to read the oracle (cf. Hab. 2:2, \u201cMake it plain on tablets, so he may run who reads it\u201d). A <i>gill\u0101y\u00f4n<\/i> is not a scroll or a stone tablet <span>(l\u00fba\u1e25)<\/span>, but a flat piece of wood (Ezek. 37:16) or metal (Isa. 3:23), and thus appropriate for posting as a sort of placard.<\/p> <p>It is not clear what is meant by <i>an ordinary stylus<\/i> (lit. \u201cthe stylus of a man\u201d). The idea of an \u201cordinary stylus\u201d is dependent upon the interpretation of Deut. 3:11, where the \u201ccubit of a man\u201d is understood to be an ordinary cubit. As Wildberger points out, however, a cubit is the length of a man\u2019s forearm, so the \u201cordinary\u201d element may be read in unnecessarily there. If this idea is correct, it is still far from certain what it means. Many commentators assume it to be a figure of speech for a common style of script that could be easily read (cf. the English expression \u201che wrote a clear hand\u201d).<\/p> <p><i>to Maher-shalal-hash-baz<\/i> is made up of a <i>lamed<\/i> followed by two participles (<i>m\u0101h\u0113r<\/i> and <i>h\u0101\u0161<\/i>) and two nouns which are apparently accusatives of direction (<i>\u0161\u0101l\u0101l<\/i> and <i>b\u0101z<\/i>), resulting in the ominous meaning \u201cspeeding to the plunder, hurrying to the spoil.\u201d The function of the <i>lamed<\/i> depends to some degree on whether the phrase was already understood as a name. If not, then it may merely function as a marker of the accusative case. If it is already understood as a name, then the <i>lamed<\/i> is probably functioning as a preposition with the meaning of \u201creferring to\u201d or \u201cbelonging to.\u201d In view of the later birth and naming of the child, it seems likely that the placard is not only a prediction of the coming attack upon Syria and Israel, but also of the birth of the child. Functioning in this twofold way, the writing would have even greater impact: first when the child was born, then again when Tiglath-pileser began to sack their former enemies.<\/p> <p><a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODEwXQ==\">2<\/a> <i>call to witness.<\/i> The MT has a first person imperfect verb at this point, \u201cI will call to witness\u201d (so NIV). This makes God the subject, which seems rather strange under the circumstances. However, it is not a priori impossible if it were supported by the ancient versions. In fact, none of them support it. The Vulgate has a past tense (converted imperfect?, \u201cI called,\u201d subject Isaiah), but it too stands alone, for the LXX, Targum, Syriac, and 1QIs all have an imperative. In view of this textual support, the imperative seems the best reading.<\/p> <p>The purpose of having the writing witnessed is not clear. Wolf is of the opinion that the document is in fact a marriage document. While this idea is very intriguing, it has only circumstantial evidence (v. 3) in its support. On the other hand, there is no other instance where a prophetic writing was witnessed, and thus it is certainly possible that the document was some sort of legal instrument. Yet another possibility is that the act was done for the benefit of the witnesses. It is certainly suggestive that the high priest who modified the high altar to correspond with the one at Damascus (2 K. 16:10\u201316) was also named Uriah. It seems almost certain that this is the same man. Thus, just as Ahaz was forced to become party to the sign of Immanuel, so Ahaz\u2019s priest (and is Zechariah a royal prophet?) is made party to the sign of Maher-shalal-hash-baz. God will not allow them to slip into apostasy. They must do it deliberately. In any case, that the writing had been witnessed by men of public stature made it impossible to level a charge of \u201cprophecy after the fact\u201d against Isaiah in coming years.<\/p> <p><a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODExXQ==\">3<\/a> That the conception and birth of the child seem to take place after the writing of the scroll troubles some commentators. Yet it need not cause any difficulty. It only calls for an act of faith on Isaiah\u2019s part, and ours, similar to that which he was asking of his king and people. Only when faith is reduced to vague generalities does this kind of act become incomprehensible.<\/p> <p>Noting that <i>drew near<\/i> is a euphemism used several times in the OT for the first intercourse between a man and his wife and that <span>\u2018alm\u00e2<\/span> is frequently used of a woman about to be married, Wolf argues that Shear-jashub\u2019s mother had died and that Isaiah had initially referred in 7:14 to the prophetess who was to become his wife.<\/p> <p><i>the prophetess.<\/i> While it is possible that Isaiah\u2019s wife is so titled merely because she was the wife of a prophet, it is also entirely possible that she was a prophetess in her own right (cf. Exod. 15:20; Judg. 4:4; 2 K. 22:14; Neh. 6:14).<\/p> <p><a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODEyXQ==\">4<\/a> Here the initial meaning of the words first published at least nine months earlier (v. 1) becomes apparent. God\u2019s word is sure. Not only will Ephraim and Syria withdraw from Judah, they will be themselves plundered. Although the name seems ominous in the extreme it is precisely like Immanuel in its initial implications: Judah\u2019s enemies will be destroyed, and God can be trusted. Within a short time, these events will take place. Exactly when a child can say \u201cmy father\u201d and \u201cmy mother\u201d is not clear. If the first gurgled \u201cpa-pa\u201d or \u201cma-ma\u201d is intended, then certainly the devastation of Damascus and the stripping away of Samaria\u2019s provinces that took place in 732 happened within a year of Maher-shalal-hash-baz\u2019s birth. If a more careful articulation is supposed then the birth may have taken place two or three years prior to 732. Possibly Isaiah did not intend to give an entirely precise indication, but only to say that the events were imminent. Again, as in 7:17 and 20, it is not merely Assyria as a nation, but the king of Assyria, the one with whom Ahaz has entered into alliance, whose rapacity is identified.<\/p>",
