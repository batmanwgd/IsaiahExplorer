Babylon epitomizes a &ldquo;pampered lady, securely enthroned, thinking to herself, I exist, and other than me there is nothing&rdquo; ( <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NjA4XQ==\">Isaiah 47:8<\/a> ). Like her, they will be compelled to strip bare in their deprivation (cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODYwMiI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 47:2&ndash;3<\/a> ) if they don&rsquo;t do so now and repent. Lands presently yielding ample produce will turn to &ldquo;briars and thorns&rdquo; (q&ocirc;&#7779; &scaron;&#257;m&icirc;r)&mdash;literally and figuratively&mdash;as enemies invade and the wicked overrun the land (cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTc3NDUiOjJ9LHsiMTc4MDYiOjN9LFsxODMxNywxODg5Nl1d\">Isaiah 5:5&ndash;6; 7:23&ndash;25; 34:13; 64:10<\/a> ).<\/p>",
