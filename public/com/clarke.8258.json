This, says Kimchi, is a Chaldee word: and it is worthy of remark that the prophet, writing to the Chaldeans, uses several words peculiar to their own language to point out the nature of the Divine judgments, and the causes of them. See the note on <a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 10:11<\/a>; (note). Sixteen of Kennicott's MSS., and seventeen of De Rossi's, and one ancient of my own, have the word<span class=\"greek-hebrew\"> \u05d1\u05de\u05d8\u05d0\u05d8\u05d9<\/span><span class=\"translit\"> bematatey<\/span> , in the plural. \"I will sweep her with the besoms of destruction.\"<\/p> ",
