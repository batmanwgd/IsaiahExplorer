    "html": "<p>Isaiah&rsquo;s locating the fulfillment of his prophecy in &ldquo;the latter days&rdquo; or &ldquo;end-time&rdquo; (<em>&rsquo;aharit hayyamim<\/em>) ties his entire &ldquo;vision&rdquo; of events (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NjU2XQ==\">Isaiah 1:1<\/a>) to that time frame. One way Isaiah does this is to predict the same event several times in different combinations with other events, domino fashion, throughout his book. By that means, he establishes a single scenario of events, all of which connect to the present passage&rsquo;s context of the &ldquo;end-time.&rdquo; Isaiah&rsquo;s Seven-Part Structure&mdash;a synchronous literary structure that establishes a single scenario for his entire book&mdash;connects to the same end-time time frame.<\/p><p><em>The mountain of Jehovah&rsquo;s house.<\/em> While the word &ldquo;mountain&rdquo; may refer to a literal mountain, Isaiah additionally establishes a metaphorical meaning for this term by means of synonymous parallels that identify a &ldquo;mountain&rdquo; as a &ldquo;nation&rdquo; or &ldquo;kingdom&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxNzkxMV0seyIxODg4NyI6Mn1d\">Isaiah 13:4; 64:1-2<\/a> ; cf.<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzA0XQ==\">52:7<\/a> ; and Babylon as a &ldquo;destroying mountain,&rdquo;<a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 51:24-25<\/a>). The &ldquo;mountain of Jehovah&rsquo;s house&rdquo; thus signifies the nation of Jehovah&rsquo;s house, in which the term &ldquo;house&rdquo; refers to his temple (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4OTI0LDE4OTQzXQ==\">Isaiah 66:1, 20<\/a>). From that holy place, Jehovah directs the affairs of his people and of all nations (cf.<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxNzc3MV0seyIxNzc3OSI6NX0seyIxODc2MCI6M31d\">Isaiah 6:1, 9-13; 56:6-8<\/a>).<\/p><p><em>As the head of the mountains.<\/em> When we apply the metaphorical meaning of this passage, we are reminded of Jehovah&rsquo;s promise to his people Israel that if they would keep the terms of the Sinai Covenant they would become the head of the nations as a covenant blessing (<a class=\"ref\">Deuteronomy 28:13<\/a>). A secondary meaning of the word &ldquo;head&rdquo; (<em>ro&rsquo;s<\/em>)&mdash;also &ldquo;chief&rdquo; or &ldquo;top&rdquo;&mdash;on the other hand, alludes to a physical location. (While the Masoretic Text uses the preposition &ldquo;in&rdquo; [<em>be<\/em> ], the older, Dead Sea scroll of Isaiah reads &ldquo;as&rdquo; [<em>ke<\/em> ].) In the end-time context of this passage, therefore, both meanings may apply.<\/p><p><em>All nations will flow to it.<\/em> To this prominent end-time nation, other nations and peoples are drawn. The verb &ldquo;flow&rdquo; or &ldquo;stream&rdquo; (<em>nhr<\/em>)&mdash;as in &ldquo;nations&rdquo; or &ldquo;Gentiles&rdquo; (<em>goyim<\/em>) &ldquo;flowing&rdquo; or &ldquo;streaming&rdquo;&mdash;is a word link that connects this passage to two others that predict &ldquo;nations&rdquo; or &ldquo;Gentiles&rdquo; (<em>goyim<\/em>) &ldquo;flowing&rdquo; or &ldquo;streaming&rdquo; (<em>nhr<\/em>). Both deal with the return of Jehovah&rsquo;s people from among the nations in a new exodus to Zion (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg4MjUiOjN9LFsxODkzNV1d\">Isaiah 60:3-5; 66:12<\/a>). Those passages thus suggest that<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3Njg5XQ==\">verses 2-3<\/a> portray the new exodus to Zion, while that event is here given a time frame&mdash;the &ldquo;end-time&rdquo; (<em>&rsquo;aharit hayyamim<\/em>).<\/p> ",
