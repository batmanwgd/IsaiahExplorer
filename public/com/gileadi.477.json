    "html": "<p>Jehovah sustains and endows with his Spirit his servant (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 11:2; 48:16; 61:1<\/a>), who here appears under his spiritual (and often suffering) persona (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 49:7; 50:7-10; 52:14; 53:11<\/a>). Jehovah commissions him to restore justice to the &ldquo;nations&rdquo; or &ldquo;Gentiles&rdquo; (<em>goyim<\/em>), inferring that there is no justice or only a fa&ccedil;ade of justice among his people and the nations (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 5:7; 10:1-2; 59:11, 15<\/a>). Types of Jehovah&rsquo;s &ldquo;servant&rdquo; or vassal include Isaiah (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 20:3<\/a>), Eliakim (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 22:20<\/a>), Cyrus (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 44:26-28<\/a>), Hezekiah (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 37:15-20; 38:2-6<\/a>), Moses (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 63:11-14<\/a>), and David (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 55:3-4<\/a>).<\/p><p>Because no one type covers all the end-time roles Jehovah&rsquo;s servant fulfills, Isaiah presents him under different personas. Consistent with persons in the seraph category, his mission, like those of Moses and Elijah, is international in scope (<a class=\"ref\">Exodus 3:16-22; 1 Kings 19:15-16<\/a>). At first directed to the Jacob\/Israel category of Jehovah&rsquo;s people dispersed among the nations (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 11:10-12; 41:8-9; 43:1-8; 49:8-12<\/a>), the servant&rsquo;s task is to bring as many as will repent to renew the covenant with Jehovah and to ascend to higher spiritual categories (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODUwMl0seyIxODUzNSI6NX0seyIxODU1NSI6Mn0seyIxODU4MSI6N30seyIxODU5OSI6Mn1d\">v 21; Isaiah 44:1-5, 21-22; 45:19-25; 46:12-13<\/a>).<\/p>",
