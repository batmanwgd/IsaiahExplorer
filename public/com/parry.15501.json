The phrases \"end of the earth,\" \"the sea,\" \"the isles,\" \"the wilderness,\" \"the cities,\" \"the villages,\" \"the rock,\" \"the mountains,\" and \"the islands\" indicate that the earth's inhabitants are universally invited to sing praises to the Lord. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODQ5NCI6NX0=\">Isa. 42:13-17<\/a> describes God as a mighty warrior who will destroy the wicked, especially those who pronounce to their graven images that \"ye are our gods.\" Note the active role God plays in their destruction, for the personal pronoun <i>I,<\/i> referring to the Lord, is found eleven times. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDk3XQ==\">Isa. 42:16<\/a> is an interjection about the spiritually blind. We, the house of Israel, are the blind (JST 42:19-23) whom God leads down paths, and out of darkness into the light.<\/p> <blockquote>Sing unto the Lord a new song,     <br>and his praise from the end of the earth,     <br>ye that go down to the <i>sea,<\/i> and <u>all that is therein<\/u>;     <br>the <i>isles,<\/i> and <u>the inhabitants thereof<\/u>. (42:10)     <br>Let the <i>wilderness<\/i> and the <u>cities<\/u> thereof lift up their voice,     <br>the <i>villages<\/i> that Kedar doth inhabit:     <br>let the <i>inhabitants<\/i> of the rock <u>sing<\/u>,     <br>let <i>them<\/i> <u>shout<\/u> from the top of the mountains. (42:11)     <br>Let them <i>give glory<\/i> unto the <u>Lord<\/u>,     <br>and <i>declare<\/i> <u>his<\/u> <i>praise<\/i> in the islands. (42:12)     <br><i>The Lord<\/i> shall <u>go forth<\/u> as a mighty man,     <br><i>he<\/i> shall <u>stir up<\/u> jealousy like a man of war:     <br><i>he<\/i> shall <u>cry<\/u>, yea, <u>roar<\/u>;     <br><i>he<\/i> shall <u>prevail<\/u> against his enemies. (42:13)     <br><i>I <\/i>have long time [<u>held] my peace<\/u>;     <br><i>I <\/i> have <u>been still<\/u><i>, <\/i>and <u>refrained myself<\/u>:     <br>now will <i>I <\/i> <u>cry<\/u> like a travailing woman;     <br><i>I <\/i> will <u>destroy<\/u> and <u>devour<\/u> at once. (42:14)     <br>I will <i>make waste mountains and hills,<\/i> and <u>dry up<\/u> all their herbs;     <br>and I <i>will make the rivers islands,<\/i> and I will <u>dry up<\/u> the pools. (42:15)     <br>And I will <i>bring<\/i> the blind by a <u>way that they knew not<\/u>;     <br>I will <i>lead<\/i> them in <u>paths that they have not known<\/u>:     <br><i>I <\/i> will make <u>darkness light<\/u> before them, and <u>crooked things straight<\/u>.     <br>These things will<i> I <\/i> <u>do unto them<\/u>, and not forsake them. (42:16)     <br><i>They<\/i> shall be <u>turned back<\/u>,     <br><i>they<\/i> shall be greatly <u>ashamed<\/u>,     <br><i>that trust<\/i> in <u>graven images<\/u>,     <br><i>that say<\/i> to the <u>molten images<\/u>,     <br>Ye are our gods.
