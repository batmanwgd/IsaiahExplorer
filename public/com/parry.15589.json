As footnote 11<i>c<\/i> in the LDS edition of the Bible says, \"This invites one to tell the Lord what one wants to know.\" The New International Version gives an alternative reading, putting this verse as a continuation of the questions asked in verses 9 and 10: \"Concerning things to come, do you question me about my children, or give me orders about the work of my hands?\"<\/p> <p><i>my sons.<\/i> The true followers of Christ are born again as his sons and his daughters.<\/p> <p><i>hands.<\/i> God is the one whose hands made the heaven and the earth.<\/p> ",
