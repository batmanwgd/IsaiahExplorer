Here the inundation of the Nile gives special force to the comparison. The daughter of Tarshish (i.e., Tarshish itself) is to spread and overflow in independent action. The colonies of Tyre are no longer subject to her, paying tribute or custom duties as she might ordain. There is no \u201cstrength,\u201d no \u201cgirdle\u201d now to restrain them, no limit such as Tyre had imposed on their commerce or colonisation. It is significant that Cyprus revolted about this time, and that the Ph\u0153nician colonies took part in attacking the mother city under Sennacherib (Jos. Ant. ix. 14. 2). <\/p> ",
