He also says that the judgments for wickedness are like a fire that devours the briers, thorns, and thickets. In other words, the wicked will be like the \"fuel of the fire,\" and the smoke will be so thick that the skies will be darkened. The burning of the wicked here is a type and shadow of the burning that will occur at the Second Coming.<\/p> ",
