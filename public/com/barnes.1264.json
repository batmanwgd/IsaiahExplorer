The sense of this passage is, that Jehovah would enlighten the judges of the land, so that they should understand what was right, and be disposed to do it.<\/p><p><em>To him that sitteth in judgment<\/em>&mdash;This is to be understood collectively, and means those who sat upon the bench of justice; that is, the magistracy in general.<\/p><p><em>And for strength to to them that turn the battle to the gate<\/em>&mdash;That is, to the very gate of their enemies; who not only repel their foes from their own city, but who drive them even to the gates of their own cities, and besiege them there. Thus <a class=\"ref\">2 Samuel 11:23<\/a>: &lsquo;And we were upon them even unto the entering of the gate;&rsquo; that is, we drove them back unto their own gates.<\/p>",
