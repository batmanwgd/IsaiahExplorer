    "html": "<em>Introduction<\/em>\n\n<br>\n\n  <p>  We are now drawing towards the conclusion of this evangelical prophecy,  the last two chapters of which direct us to look as far forward as the  new heavens and the new earth, the new world which the gospel  dispensation should bring in, and the separation that should by it be  made between the precious and the vile. \"For judgment\" (says Christ)  \"have I come into this world.\" And why should it seem absurd that the  prophet here should speak of that to which all the prophets bore  witness?   <a class=\"ref\">1 Peter 1:10<\/a>.  The rejection of the Jews, and the calling in of the Gentiles, are  often mentioned in the New Testament as that which was foreseen and  foretold by the prophets,   <a class=\"ref\">Acts 10:43; Romans 16:26<\/a>.  In this chapter we have,  I. The anticipating of the Gentiles with the gospel call,   <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 65:1<\/a>.  II. The rejection of the Jews for their obstinacy and unbelief,   <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 65:2-7<\/a>.  III. The saving of a remnant of them by bringing them into the gospel  church,   <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 65:8-10<\/a>.  IV. The judgments of God that should pursue the rejected Jews,   <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 65:11-16<\/a>.  V. The blessings reserved for the Christian church, which should be its  joy and glory,   <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 65:17-25<\/a>.  But these things are here prophesied of under the type and figure of  the difference God would make between some and others of the Jews after  their return out of captivity, between those that feared God and those  that did not, with reproofs of the sins then found among them and  promises of the blessings then in reserve for them.<\/p>",
