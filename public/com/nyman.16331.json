People also reflect their positive spiritual conditions; Alma described the born-again person as one who has received the image of Christ in his countenance (see <a class=\"ref\">Alma 5:14<\/a>). Elder Marion D. Hanks used this passage in Isaiah to show that iniquities separate people from the Spirit (CR, Oct. 1973, p. 16), which would of course leave a countenance of evil upon their faces.<\/p>     ",
