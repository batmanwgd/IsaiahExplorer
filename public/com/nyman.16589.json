There will be many more of them than the remnant who will already have gathered and built the New Jerusalem, or those whom Isaiah calls the \"children of the married wife.\" The symbolic marriage of Christ to Israel is here represented, with the members of the Church being considered the children of that covenant relationship.<\/p>     ",
