When Moses made the Ark of the Covenant from which Jehovah spoke with him, he thus constructed a &ldquo;mercy seat&rdquo; of pure gold on top of the ark featuring two cherubim, one on each side (<a class=\"ref\">Exodus 25:17-22; 37:6-9<\/a>). As the God who &ldquo;made the heavens and the earth,&rdquo; who is &ldquo;over all the kingdoms of the earth,&rdquo; Jehovah can&rsquo;t be compared to the gods of the nations.<\/p> ",
