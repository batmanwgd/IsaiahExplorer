    "html": "<p><b>(<a class=\"ref\">2 Nephi 27:28<\/a>).<\/b>\"<i>Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field.<\/i>\" Lebanon was the northernmost portion of Palestine. It was part of the land promised to the Israelites when they crossed into Canaan. (<a class=\"ref\">Deuteronomy 1:6-7; Joshua 1:1-4<\/a>.) Isaiah's prophecy has been interpreted to include the entire land of Canaan. President Joseph Fielding Smith wrote of the \"deplorable condition\" of this land prior to its redemption in recent years, which redemption was in fulfillment of prophecy. (DS 3:260-61.)<\/p>     <p>Elder Orson Pratt noted that this changed condition would occur only following the publication of the book which Isaiah saw; \"at which time Lebanon and all the land of Canaan is again to be blessed, while the fruitful field occupied by the nations of the Gentiles, 'will be esteemed as a forest:' the multitude of the nations of the Gentiles are to perish, and their lands which are now like a fruitful field, are to be left desolate of inhabitants and become as Lebanon has been for many generations past: while Lebanon shall again be occupied by Israel, and be turned into a fruitful field. These great events could not take place until the Lord should first bring forth a book out of the ground.\" (OPW, 276 77.)<\/p>",
