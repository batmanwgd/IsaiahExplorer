This prophecy was fulfilled at Jesus' resurrection. Matthew recorded that after Jesus arose from the dead, \"the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose\" (<a class=\"ref\">Matt. 27:52-53<\/a>). <\/p> <p><i>Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust. <\/i>The call is made for those who are dead to awake from the sleep of death and sing praises to the Lord who made the resurrection possible. Joseph Smith also prophesied, \"And the graves of the saints shall be opened; and they shall come forth and stand on the right hand of the Lamb, when he shall stand upon Mount Zion, and upon the holy city, the New Jerusalem; and they shall sing the song of the Lamb, day and night forever and ever\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 133:56; D&amp;C 128:22<\/a>). <\/p> <p><i>for thy dew is as the<\/i> <i>dew of the morning. <\/i>The literal reading of the phrase <i>dew of the morning<\/i> is \"dew of lights.\" Isaiah compares resurrected bodies to the dew of the morning because of dew's association with life. \"<i>Dew<\/i> is a very important element in Palestine's ecosystem. During the long dry months it is the only moisture the vegetation receives. It became a symbol for life. Light is also an important symbol of life and well-being.\" Interestingly, dew is also associated with the manna given to the Israelites to save their lives during the exodus (Ex. 16:13-15; <a class=\"ref\">Num. 11:9<\/a>). <\/p> <p><i>earth shall cast out the dead. <\/i>This is another reference to the resurrection.<\/p> ",
