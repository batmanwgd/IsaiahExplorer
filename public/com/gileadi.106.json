Using the imagery of tithing&mdash;in which the Israelites pay a tenth of the land&rsquo;s yield to the Levites and the Levites pay a tenth of that tenth to the priests (<a class=\"ref\">Numbers 18:24-28<\/a>)&mdash;Isaiah contrasts the many who perish with the few who survive. The &ldquo;holy offspring&rdquo; left standing&mdash;a tenth of the tenth&mdash;compares to a terebinth or oak that can renew itself when cut down.
