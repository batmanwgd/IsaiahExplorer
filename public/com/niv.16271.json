Despite what \u201cwe\u201d thought, he is not suffering because God has inflicted deserved punishment on him (53:4). It is our suffering that he bore, and it is for \u201cour transgressions\u201d and \u201cour iniquities\u201d that he suffered (53:5). The repetition of first-person plural pronouns hammers home that the Servant has suffered in \u201cour\u201d place.<\/p>     <p>\u2003There has been endless debate about who the first readers understood the \u201cwe\u201d to refer to. It seems plain to me that the obvious referents are the prophet and the people he is addressing. This makes it utterly clear that the people, while remaining the servants of God to bear witness to his saving power, are not the Servant of the Lord who will bring justice and deliverance to the earth (as some claim). Verse 6 drives this point home with imagery. \u201cWe,\u201d the blind, rebellious people of God (cf. 42:18\u201325), are the sheep who have gone astray, but he is the one who gets beaten for our willfulness!<\/p>     ",
