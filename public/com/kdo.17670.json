    "html": "<p> The prophet now repeats a thought which formed one of the refrains of the second prophetic address (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3Njk1LDE3Njk3XQ==\">Isaiah 2:9, Isaiah 2:11<\/a>, cf., <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzAzXQ==\">Isaiah 2:17<\/a>). It acquires here a still deeper sense, from the context in which it stands. <em> \u201cThen are mean men bowed down, and lords humbled, and the eyes of lofty men are humbled. And Jehovah of hosts shows Himself exalted in judgment, and God the Holy One sanctifies Himself in righteousness.\u201d<\/em> That which had exalted itself from earth to heaven, would be cast down earthwards into hell. The consecutive futures depict the coming events, which are here represented as historically present, as the direct sequel of what is also represented as present in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzU0XQ==\">Isaiah 5:14<\/a> : Hades opens, and then both low and lofty in Jerusalem sink down, and the soaring eyes now wander about in horrible depths. God, who is both exalted and holy in Himself, demanded that as the exalted One He should be exalted, and that as the Holy One He should be sanctified. But Jerusalem had not done that; He would therefore prove Himself the exalted One by the execution of justice, and sanctify Himself (<em> nikdash <\/em> is to be rendered as a reflective verb, according to <a class=\"ref\">Ezekiel 36:23; Ezekiel 38:23<\/a>) by the manifestation of righteousness, in consequence of which the people of Jerusalem would have to give Him glory against their will, as forming part of \u201cthe things under the earth\u201d (<a class=\"ref\">Philemon 2:10<\/a>). Jerusalem has been swallowed up twice in this manner by Hades; once in the Chaldean war, and again in the Roman. But the invisible background of these outward events was the fact, that it had already fallen under the power of hell. And now, even in a more literal sense, ancient Jerusalem, like the company of Korah (<a class=\"ref\">Numbers 16:30, Numbers 16:33<\/a>), has gone underground. Just as Babylon and Nineveh, the ruins of which are dug out of the inexhaustible mine of their far-stretching foundation and soil, have sunk beneath the ground; so do men walk about in modern Jerusalem over the ancient Jerusalem, which lies buried beneath; and many an enigma of topography will remain an enigma until ancient Jerusalem has been dug out of the earth again.<\/p>",
