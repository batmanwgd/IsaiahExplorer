    "html": " <p> <em>With the abundance of her glory \"From her abundant stores\"\u2014<\/em>, For <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05de\u05d6\u05d9\u05d6 <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, mizziz<\/span>, from the splendor, two MSS. and the old edition of 1488, have <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05de\u05d6\u05d9\u05d5 <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, mizziv<\/span>,; and the latter <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d6 <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, zain<\/span>, is upon a rasure in three other MSS. It is remarkable that Kimchi and Sal. ben Melec, not being able to make any thing of the word as it stands in the text, say it means the same with <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05de\u05d6\u05d9\u05d5 <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, mizziv<\/span>,; that is, in effect, they admit of a various reading, or an error in the text. But as Vitringa observes, what sense is there in sucking nourishment from the splendor of her glory? He therefore endeavors to deduce another sense of the word <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d6\u05d9\u05d6 <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, ziz<\/span>,; but, as far as it appears to me, without any authority. I am more inclined to accede to the opinion of those learned rabbins, and to think that there is some mistake in the word; for that in truth is their opinion, though they disguise it by saying that the corrupted word means the very same with that which they believe to be genuine. So in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDc2XQ==\">Isaiah 41:24<\/a>; they say that <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d0\u05e4\u05e2 <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, apha<\/span>, a viper, means the same with <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d0\u05e4\u05e1 <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, ephes<\/span>, nothing; instead of acknowledging that one is written by mistake instead of the other. I would propose to read in this place <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05de\u05d6\u05d9\u05df <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, mizzin<\/span>, or <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05de\u05d6\u05df <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, mizzen<\/span>, which is the reading of one of De Rossi's MS., (instead of <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05de\u05d6\u05d9\u05d6 <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, meziz <\/span>), from the stores, from <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d6\u05d5\u05df <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, zun<\/span>, to nourish, to feed; see <a class=\"ref\">Genesis 45:23; 2 Chronicles 11:23; Psalm 144:13<\/a>. And this perhaps may be meant by Aquila, who renders the word by <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u03b1\u03c0\u03bf \u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03b4\u03b1\u03c0\u03b9\u03b1\u03c2\u0387<\/span>, with which that of the Vulgate, <i>ab omnimoda gloria<\/i>, and of Symmachus and Theodotion, nearly agree. The Chaldee follows a different reading, without improving the sense; <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05de\u05d9\u05d9\u05df <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, meyin<\/span>, from the wine. - L. <\/p>",
