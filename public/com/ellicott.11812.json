The prophets of the return from exile, Zechariah, Haggai, Malachi, may be thought of as representative examples of such \u201cwatchmen,\u201d as also are the prophets of the Christian Church, which takes partly, at least, the position of the new Jerusalem. <\/p>\n <p>Ye that make mention . . .\u2014Better, ye that are the remembrancers. They are to remind Jehovah of His promises day and night, that He may hasten their fulfilment, never resting till the future Jerusalem is in very deed \u201ca praise in the earth.\u201d (Comp. <a class=\"ref\">Zechariah 1:12<\/a>.) <\/p>",
