The parents of Cyrus could not give him this name to fulfill the prediction, as they knew nothing of it. Amon was apprised that a person called Josias would overturn idolatry; but he had no reason to suppose that it would be his son, 1 Kings xiii. 2. &mdash;<i> My shepherd.<\/i> Chaldean, \"that he shall reign.\" This was shewn by the Jews to Cyrus, on which account, (Calmet) he gave them leave to return, &c. (Josephus, [Antiquities?] xi. 1.) &mdash; The title of shepherd is given to Agamemnon by Homer, and it denotes a good prince, such as historians represent Cyrus to have been. He observed that kings and shepherds had the like duties to perform; (Xenophon viii.) and after his death he was bewailed as a \"father.\" (Herodotus iii. 89.) &mdash; At first he did not bear the name of Cyrus, (Herodotus i. 113.) which in the Persian language means \"the sun.\" (Ctesias.)
