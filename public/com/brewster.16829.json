The fly and the bee might be representative of invading forces from the countries of Egypt and Assyria, who will come upon the people no matter where they are hiding. Another possible interpretation is that the devastation of the land of Judah will be so severe that swarms of flies and bees will be attracted (summoned or hissed for) to the desolate land from Egypt and Assyria.<\/p>",
