Their being spiritually and physically &ldquo;complacent&rdquo; and &ldquo;carefree&rdquo; in the face of his impending judgments leaves them unprepared and exposed to the evil time. With another year left of Jehovah&rsquo;s three-year warning before Assyria&rsquo;s assault (cf.<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3OTg0LDE4MDMzXQ==\">Isaiah 16:14; 20:3<\/a>), Jehovah&rsquo;s<em>voice<\/em> &mdash;his servant&mdash;alerts them to the coming time of scarcity. Like Lot&rsquo;s wife, who couldn&rsquo;t imagine sudden destruction falling upon her city that had been there for centuries (<a class=\"ref\">Genesis 19:26<\/a>), they too stand to perish (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzcyNCI6MTF9\">Isaiah 3:16-26<\/a>).<\/p> ",
