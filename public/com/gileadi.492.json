    "html": " <p>As in this instance, a chaos motif to end a chapter and a creation motif to begin a chapter characterizes Isaiah&rsquo;s chiastic pattern of alternating chaos and creation motifs that spans chapters 41-46. Affirming Jehovah&rsquo;s role as Creator of all things&mdash;as an unending source of creation, not only in the past but also in the future&mdash;this pattern by its very nature defines creation as re-creation, as deconstruction followed by reconstruction and degeneration followed by regeneration. He who created Jacob\/Israel as his covenant people is able to re-create them on higher spiritual levels stretching into eternity. <\/p> <p>Jehovah&rsquo;s admonition, &ldquo;Do not fear!&rdquo; forms a word link to <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODQ2MCI6N30=\">Isaiah 41:8-14<\/a>, in which Jacob\/Israel is invited to return from the end of the earth. That return occurs in an exodus to Zion from the four directions of the earth (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg1MTEiOjJ9LHsiMTc4OTYiOjJ9LHsiMTg2NDgiOjJ9XQ==\">vv 5-6; Isaiah 11:11-12; 49:11-12<\/a>). Jacob\/Israel qualifies for such physical deliverance upon being spiritually &ldquo;redeemed&rdquo; by Jehovah and by his people&rsquo;s accepting his redemption (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg1NTUiOjJ9LHsiMTg2MzUiOjJ9LHsiMTg2ODQiOjJ9XQ==\">Isaiah 44:21-22; 48:20-21; 51:10-11<\/a>). Jehovah&rsquo;s calling them &ldquo;by name&rdquo; and claiming them as &ldquo;mine&rdquo; signifies ascent to a higher spiritual level, which the Jacob\/Israel category is now invited to undertake. <\/p>",
