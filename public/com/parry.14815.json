    "html": " <p><i>The ancient nation of Assyria, with its cruel and bloody leaders and well-disciplined, fierce armies, destroyed other equally evil nations. This scenario of Assyria and war anticipates the warring nations of our own day and of the future, contending for land, power, and riches. Those same evils will be present in our own day, and the thirst for blood will also exist. But as Assyria, her leaders, and her armies were soon destroyed according to God's plan, so also will the warring nations of the last days be annihilated at the Second Coming. Isaiah's language\u2014burning of a fire, flame, devour, and consume\u2014applies to both ancient Assyria and the future nations at Christ's coming. Meanwhile, a righteous remnant of Israel will be saved at the last day as they worship in their temples.<\/i><\/p> ",
