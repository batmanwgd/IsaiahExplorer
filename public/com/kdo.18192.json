    "html": "<p> The participles which follow in the next v. are in apposition to \u05d0\u05ea\u05bc , and confirm the predicates already applied to them. They soon give place, however, to independent sentences. <em> \u201cYe that inflame yourselves by the terebinths, under every green tree, ye slayers of children in the valleys under the clefts of the rocks. By the smooth ones of the brook was thy portion; they, they were thy lot: thou also pouredst out libations to them, thou laidst meat-offerings upon them. Shall I be contented with this?\u201d<\/em> The people of the captivity are addressed, and the idolatry handed down to them from their ancestors depicted. The prophet looks back from the standpoint of the captivity, and takes his colours from the time in which he himself lived, possibly from the commencement of Manasseh's reign, when the heathenism that had for a long time been suppressed burst forth again in all its force, and the measure of iniquity became full. The <em> part. niphal<\/em> \u05d4\u05e0\u05bc\u05d7\u05de\u05d9\u05dd is formed like \u05e0\u05d7\u05df in <a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 22:23<\/a>, if the latter signifies <em> miserandum esse <\/em> . The primary form is \u05e0\u05d7\u05dd , which is doubled like \u05e0\u05d2\u05bc\u05e8 from \u05d2\u05bc\u05e8\u05e8 in <a class=\"ref\">Job 20:28<\/a>, and from which \u05e0\u05d7\u05dd is formed by the resolution of the latent reduplication. Stier derives it from; but even if formed from this, \u05e0\u05d7\u05dd would still have to be explained from \u05e0\u05d7\u05dd , after the form \u05e0\u05e6\u05bc\u05ea . <em> 'El\u0131\u0304m <\/em> signifies either gods or terebinths. But although it might certainly mean idols, according to <a class=\"ref\">Exodus 15:11; Daniel 11:36<\/a> (lxx, Targ., and Jerome), it is never used directly in this sense, and Isaiah always uses the word as the name of a tree (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3Njg0LDE4ODQ3XQ==\">Isaiah 1:29; Isaiah 61:3<\/a>). The terebinths are introduced here, exactly as in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3Njg0XQ==\">Isaiah 1:29<\/a>, as an object of idolatrous lust: \u201cwho inflame themselves with the terebinths;\u201d \u05d1 denotes the object with which the lust is excited and inf <em> Lamed<\/em> . The terebinth (<em> 'e\u0304la\u0302h <\/em> ) held the chief place in tree-worship (hence \u05d0\u05dc\u05e0\u05dd , lit., oak-trees, together with \u05d0\u05dc\u05dd , is the name of one of the Phoenician gods),<\/p><p> (Note: See Levy, <em> Ph\u00f6nizische Studien<\/em> , i. 19.)<\/p><p> possibly as being the tree sacred to Astarte; just as the <em> Samura Acacia<\/em> among the heathen Arabs was the tree sacred to the goddess <em> ' Uzza<\/em> .<\/p><p> (Note: Krehl, <em> Religioin der vorisl<\/em> . Araber, p. 74ff.)<\/p><p> The following expression, \u201cunder every green tree,\u201d is simply a permutative of the words \u201cwith the terebinths\u201d in the sense of \u201cwith the terebinths, yea, under every green tree\u201d (a standing expression from <a class=\"ref\">Deuteronomy 12:2<\/a> downwards) - one tree being regarded as the abode and favourite of this deity, and another of that, and all alluring you to your carnal worship. <\/p><p> From the tree-worship with its orgies, which was so widely spread in antiquity generally, the prophet passes to the leading Canaanitish abomination, viz., human sacrifices, which had been adopted by the Israelites (along with \u05e9\u05c1\u05d7\u05d8\u05d9 we find the false reading \u05e9\u05c2\u05d7\u05d8\u05d9 , which is interpreted as signifying self-abuse). Judging from the locality named, \u201cunder the clefts of the rocks,\u201d the reference is not to the slaying of children sacrificed to Moloch in the valley of Hinnom, but to those offered to Baal upon his <em> ba\u0302mo\u0304th <\/em> or high places (<a class=\"ref\">Jeremiah 19:5; Ezekiel 16:20-21; Hosea 13:2; Psalms 106:37-38<\/a>). As we learn from the <em> chronique scandaleuse<\/em> many things connected with the religious history of Israel, which cannot be found in its historical books, there is nothing to surprise us in the stone-worship condemned in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzcyXQ==\">Isaiah 57:6<\/a>. The <em> dagesh<\/em> of \u05d7\u05dc\u05bc\u05e7\u05d9 is in any case <em> dagesh<\/em> <em> dirimens<\/em> . The singular is wither \u05d7\u05dc\u05e7 after the form \u05d7\u05db\u05de\u05d9 (cf., \u05e2\u05e6\u05d1\u05d9 , <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzkwXQ==\">Isaiah 58:3<\/a>), or \u05d7\u05dc\u05e7 after the form \u05d9\u05dc\u05d3\u05d9 . But \u05d7\u05dc\u05e7 , smoothness, never occurs; and the explanation, \u201cin the smoothnesses, i.e., the smooth places of the valley, is thy portion,\u201d has this also against it, that it does not do justice to the connection \u05d1\u05bc \u05d7\u05dc\u05e7 , in which the preposition is not used in a local sense, and that it leaves the emphatic \u05d4\u05dd \u05d4\u05dd quite unexplained. The latter does not point to places, but to objects of worship for which they had exchanged Jehovah, of whom the true Israelite could say \u05d4 \u05d7\u05dc\u05e7\u05d9 , <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 119:57<\/a>, etc., or \u05d1\u05d4 \u05dc\u05d9 \u05d7\u05dc\u05e7 , <a class=\"ref\">Joshua 22:25<\/a>, and \u05d2\u05bc\u05d5\u05e8\u05dc\u05d9 \u05ea\u05bc\u05d5\u05de\u05d9 \u05da \u05d0\u05ea\u05bc\u05d4 (Thou art He that maintaineth my lot), <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 16:5<\/a>. The prophet had such expressions as these in his mind, and possibly also the primary meaning of \u05d2\u05d5\u05e8\u05dc = \u03ba\u03bb\u03b7\u0342\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 , which may be gathered from the rare Arabic word <em> 'garal <\/em> , gravel, stones worn smooth by rolling, when he said, \u201cIn the smooth ones of the valley is thy portion; they, they are thy lot.\u201d In the Arabic also, <em> achlaq <\/em> (equilvaent to <em> c ha\u0302la\u0302q <\/em> , smooth, which forms here a play upon the word with \u05d7\u05dc\u05e7 , <em> c ha\u0302la\u0302q <\/em> ) is a favourite word for stones and rocks. \u05d7\u05dc\u05bc\u05e7\u05d9\u05be\u05e0\u05d7\u05dc , however, according to <a class=\"ref\">1 Samuel 17:40<\/a> (where the intensive form \u05d7\u05dc\u05bc\u05d5\u05bc\u05e7 , like \u05e9\u05c1\u05db\u05bc\u05d5\u05bc\u05dc , is used), are stones which the stream in the valley has washed smooth with time, and rounded into a pleasing shape. The mode of the worship, the pouring out of libations,<\/p><p> (Note: Compare the remarks made in the <em> Comm. on the Pentateuch<\/em> , at <a class=\"ref\">Genesis 29:20<\/a>, on the heathen worship of anointed stones, and the Baetulian worship.)<\/p><p> and the laying of meat-offerings upon them, confirm this view. In Carthage such stones were called <em> abbadires <\/em> (= \u05d0\u05d3\u05d9\u05e8 , \u05d0\u05d1\u05df ); and among the ancient Arabs, the <em> asna\u0302m <\/em> or idols consisted for the most part of rude blocks of stone of this description. Herodotus (3:8) speaks of seven stones which the Arabs anointed, calling upon the god Orotal. Suidas (<em> s.v.<\/em> \u0398\u03b5\u03c5\u0342\u03c2 \u03b1\u0313\u0301\u03c1\u03b7\u03c2 ) states that the idol of Ares in Petra was a black square stone; and the black stone of the <em> Ka'aba <\/em> was, according to a very inconvenient tradition for the Mohammedans, an idol of Saturn (<em> zuhal <\/em> ).<\/p><p> (Note: See Krehl, p. 72. In the East Indies also we find stone-worship not only among the Vindya tribes (Lassen, <em> A.K.<\/em> i. 376), but also among the Vaishnavas, who worship Vishnu in the form of a stone, viz., the <em> sa\u0302lagra\u0302m <\/em> , a kind of stone from the river Gandak (see Wilson's <em> Sanscrit Lexicon s.h.v<\/em> . and <em> Vishnu<\/em> -<em> Pur\u00e2n<\/em> , p. 163). The fact of the great antiquity of stone and tree worship has been used in the most ridiculous manner by Dozy in his work on the Israelites at Mecca (1864). He draws the following conclusion from <a class=\"ref\">Deuteronomy 32:18<\/a> : \u201cThus the Israelites sprang from a divine block of stone; and this is, in reality, the true old version of the origin of the nation.\u201d From <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODY3NSI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 51:1-2<\/a>, he infers that Abraham and Sara were not historical persons at all, but that the former was a block of stone, and the latter a hollow; and that the two together were a block of stone in a hollow, to which divine worship was paid. \u201cThis fact,\u201d he says, \u201cviz. that Abraham and Sarah in the second Isaiah are not historical persons, but a block of stone and a hollow, is one of great worth, as enabling us to determine the time at which the stories of Abraham in Genesis were written, and to form a correct idea of the spirit of those stories.\u201d)<\/p><p> Stone-worship of this kind had been practised by the Israelites before the captivity, and their heathenish practices had been transmitted to the exiles in Babylon. The meaning of the question, Shall I comfort myself concerning such things? - i.e., Shall I be contented with them ( \u05d0\u05e0\u05bc\u05d7\u05dd <em> niphal<\/em> , not <em> hithpael<\/em> )? - is, that it was impossible that descendants who so resembled their fathers should remain unpunished.<\/p>",
