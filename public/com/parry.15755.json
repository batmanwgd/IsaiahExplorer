    "html": " <p><i> <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isa. 53<\/a> is one of the greatest prophecies of the Messiah found in the Old Testament. It gives us great insight into the work of the mortal Jesus and the blessings he offers us. We learn from this chapter that he will bear our transgressions and iniquities, taking them upon himself so that we can be cleansed of them. He will also bear our grief and sorrow, our emotional pain and suffering. If we will turn to him, he will heal us of all these infirmities.<\/i><\/p> <p><i>This chapter also bears testimony that Christ will die, not for his own transgressions but for the transgressions of the people. He will submit in all things to the will of the Father. His offering will bear wonderful fruit, for many will be justified by him. We can be among that number if we will receive him and his covenant and walk in righteousness.<\/i><\/p> ",
