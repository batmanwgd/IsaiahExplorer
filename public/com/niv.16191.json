How gracious he will be when you cry for help! As soon as he hears, he will answer you. Although the Lord gives you the bread of adversity and the water of affliction, your teachers will be hidden no more; with your own eyes you will see them. Whether you turn to the right or to the left, your ears will hear a voice behind you, saying, \u201cThis is the way; walk in it.\u201d Then you will defile your idols overlaid with silver and your images covered with gold; you will throw them away like a menstrual cloth and say to them, \u201cAway with you!\u201d<\/p>         <p>\u2003He will also send you rain for the seed you sow in the ground, and the food that comes from the land will be rich and plentiful. In that day your cattle will graze in broad meadows. The oxen and donkeys that work the soil will eat fodder and mash, spread out with fork and shovel. In the day of great slaughter, when the towers fall, streams of water will flow on every high mountain and every lofty hill. The moon will shine like the sun, and the sunlight will be seven times brighter, like the light of seven full days, when the LORD binds up the bruises of his people and heals the wounds he inflicted.<\/p>         <blockquote>             <p>See, the Name of the LORD comes from afar,<\/p>             <p>\u2003with burning anger and dense clouds of smoke;<\/p>             <p>his lips are full of wrath,<\/p>             <p>\u2003and his tongue is a consuming fire.<\/p>             <p>His breath is like a rushing torrent,<\/p>             <p>\u2003rising up to the neck.<\/p>             <p>\u2003He shakes the nations in the sieve of destruction;<\/p>             <p>\u2003he places in the jaws of the peoples<\/p>             <p>\u2003a bit that leads them astray.<\/p>             <p>And you will sing<\/p>             <p>\u2003as on the night you celebrate a holy festival;<\/p>             <p>your hearts will rejoice<\/p>             <p>\u2003as when people go up with flutes<\/p>             <p>to the mountain of the LORD,<\/p>             <p>\u2003to the Rock of Israel.<\/p>             <p>The L<small>ORD<\/small> will cause men to hear his majestic voice<\/p>             <p>\u2003and will make them see his arm coming down<\/p>             <p>with raging anger and consuming fire,<\/p>             <p>\u2003with cloudburst, thunderstorm and hail.<\/p>             <p>The voice of the LORD will shatter Assyria;<\/p>             <p>\u2003with his scepter he will strike them down.<\/p>             <p>Every stroke the L<small>ORD<\/small> lays on them<\/p>             <p>\u2003with his punishing rod<\/p>             <p>will be to the music of tambourines and harps,<\/p>             <p>\u2003as he fights them in battle with the blows of his arm.<\/p>             <p>Topheth has long been prepared;<\/p>             <p>\u2003it has been made ready for the king.<\/p>             <p>Its fire pit has been made deep and wide,<\/p>             <p>\u2003with an abundance of fire and wood;<\/p>             <p>the breath of the L<small>ORD<\/small>,<\/p>             <p>\u2003like a stream of burning sulfur,<\/p>             <p>\u2003sets it ablaze.<\/p>         <\/blockquote>     <\/blockquote>     <h4>Original Meaning<\/h4>     <p>T<small>HIS CHAPTER CONTAINS<\/small> the fourth \u201cwoe\u201d message between chapters 28 and 33. It is the first of two aimed specifically at the alliance with Egypt that the royal counselors are urging. Here Isaiah speaks more pointedly of the foolishness of such a course, for Egypt cannot offer any real help. She is a toothless dragon (30:1\u20137). Thus, because Judah has rejected the true help offered by God, they will be devastated, as though a high wall suddenly collapsed. They will be left like a tattered flag on a hilltop. God will have to wait until they come to their senses (30:8\u201318). When they do, he promises redemption and restoration for his people (30:19\u201326) and defeat for all their enemies (30:27\u201333).<\/p>     <p>\u2003Thus, once again we see a reiteration of the great themes of the first part of Isaiah\u2019s book. There is the poignant appeal to trust God, a promise of judgment on those who so stupidly rebel against God by trusting human nations instead of him, but then the assertion that after the judgment has come, there will yet be hope for those who turn to him.<\/p>     ",
