Jehovah&rsquo;s &ldquo;appointing&rdquo; (<em>ntn<\/em>) his servant forms a word link to his &ldquo;appointing&rdquo; (<em>ntn<\/em>) his servant throughout the Book of Isaiah (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODM2LDE4MDc0LDE4NDg3LDE4NjQzLDE4NjQ1LDE4NzQ1XQ==\">Isaiah 9:6; 22:21; 42:6; 49:6, 8; 55:4<\/a>).
