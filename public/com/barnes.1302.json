    "html": "<p><em>Woe unto them that seek deep...<\/em> &mdash;That is, who attempt to conceal their &ldquo;real&rdquo; intentions under a plausible exterior, and correct outward deportment. This is most strikingly descriptive of the character of a hypocrite who seeks to conceal his plans and his purposes from the eyes of people and of God. His external conduct is fair; his observance of the duties of religion exemplary; his attendance on the means of grace and the worship of God regular; his professions loud and constant, but the whole design is to &ldquo;conceal&rdquo; his real sentiments, and to accomplish some sinister and wicked purpose by it.<\/p><p><em>From the Lord<\/em> &mdash;This proves that the design of the hypocrite is not always to attempt to deceive his fellowmen, but that he also aims to deceive God.<\/p> ",
