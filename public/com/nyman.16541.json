    "html": "          <p>The statement that the mouth of the servant will be made \"like a sharp sword\" is a reference to the message he will bear, which is the word of God (see <a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 6:2; 11:2; 12:2; 14:2:<\/a> 15:2; 16:2; 33:1). The sword analogy reflects the cutting nature of the truth of the word of God. As Nephi wrote. \"the guilty taketh the truth to be hard, for it cutteth them to the very center\" (<a class=\"ref\">1 Ne. 16:2<\/a>). The book of Revelation also uses the sword analogy (see <a class=\"ref\">Rev. 1:16<\/a>).<\/p>     <p>The Lord's hiding Israel in \"the shadow of his hand\" is clarified in the Doctrine and Covenants, where the Lord declares that the priesthood holders of this last dispensation are \"lawful heirs, according to the flesh, and have been hid from the world with Christ in God\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 86:8-9<\/a>). This description of priesthood bearers as \"lawful heirs according to the flesh\" is a reference to the covenant which the Lord made with Abraham that all nations of the earth would be blessed through the literal seed of his body, who would bear the ministry and the priesthood (see <a class=\"ref\">Abr. 2:9-11<\/a>). The Doctrine and Covenants also identifies latter-day Israel as the \"seed of Abraham\" (<a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 103:17<\/a>). The world did not know where scattered Israel was, but the Lord knew and had concealed them in his protective hand.<\/p>     <p>The \"polished shaft\" hidden in the Lord's quiver may be a direct reference to Joseph Smith. As the \"choice seer\" of the latter day, he was to be the Lord's servant in a special sense (see <a class=\"ref\">2 Ne. 3:6; 3 Ne. 21:10<\/a>). The Prophet Joseph's description of himself is interesting in this light:<\/p>     <blockquote>I am like a huge, rough stone rolling down from a high mountain; and the only polishing I get is when some corner gets rubbed off by coming in contact with something else, striking with <i>accelerated<\/i> force against religious bigotry, priestcraft, lawyer-craft, doctor-craft, lying editors, suborned judges and jurors, and the authority of perjured executives, backed by mobs, blasphemers, licentious and corrupt men and women-all hell knocking off a corner here and a corner there. Thus I will become a smooth and polished shaft in the quiver of the Almighty, who will give me dominion over all and every one of them, when their refuge of lies shall fail, and their hiding place shall be destroyed, while these smooth-polished stones with which I come in contact become marred. (TPJS, p. 304.)<\/blockquote>     <p>The arrow shaft is polished that it might fly truer and faster, and the shaft that is polished is generally reserved for one's most important shot. The last dispensation, when all things are gathered in one, is the Lord's most important \"shot,\" so he saved his \"polished shaft\" for this latter-day work. Joseph was called to give this generation the word of God (see <a class=\"ref\">D&amp;C 5:10<\/a>), which recalls also the sharp sword analogy mentioned in verse 2.<\/p>     ",
