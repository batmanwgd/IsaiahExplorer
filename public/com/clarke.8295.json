    "html": "<p>This chapter contains a very obscure prophecy; possibly designed to give the Jews, and perhaps the Egyptians, whose country is supposed to be meant,  <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3OTk5XQ==\">Isaiah 18:1<\/a>,  <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MDAwXQ==\">Isaiah 18:2<\/a>, and with whom many Jews resided, an indignation of God's interposition in favor of Sion,  <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MDAxXQ==\">Isaiah 18:3<\/a>,  <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MDAyXQ==\">Isaiah 18:4<\/a>; and of his counsels in regard to the destruction of their common enemy, Sennacherib, whose vast army, just as he thought his projects ripe, and ready to be crowned with success,  <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MDAzXQ==\">Isaiah 18:5<\/a>, should become a prey to the beasts of the field, and to the fowls of heaven,  <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MDA0XQ==\">Isaiah 18:6<\/a>; and that Egypt should be grateful to God for the deliverance vouchsafed her,  <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MDA1XQ==\">Isaiah 18:7<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>This is one of the most obscure prophecies in the whole Book of Isaiah. The subject of it, the end and design of it, the people to whom it is addressed, the history to which it belongs, the person who sends the messengers, and the nation to whom the messengers are sent, are all obscure and doubtful. - L.<\/p>",
