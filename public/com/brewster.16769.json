The apostle Peter saw such sign seekers in the last days, who shall say, \"Where is the promise of his coming?\" (<a class=\"ref\">2 Peter 3:1-4<\/a>.) These disbelievers echo the words of others before their time who similarly mocked the faithful: \"But there were some who began to say that the time was past for the words to be fulfilled. \u2026 And they began to rejoice \u2026 [and] make a great uproar throughout the land.\" (<a class=\"ref\">3 Nephi 1:5-7<\/a>.)<\/p>",
