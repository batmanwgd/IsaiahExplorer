I. It is here charged upon this people that they had themselves stopped  the current of God's favours to them, and the particular sins are  specified which kept good things from them,   <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 59:1-8<\/a>.  II. It is here charged upon them that they had themselves procured the  judgments of God upon them, and they are told both what the judgments  were which they had brought upon their own heads  (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 59:9-11<\/a>)  and what the sins were which provoked God to send those judgments,   <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 59:12-15<\/a>.  III. It is here promised that, notwithstanding this, God would work  deliverance for them, purely for his own name's sake  (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 59:16-19<\/a>),  and would reserve mercy in store for them and entail it upon them,   <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 59:20<\/a>.<\/p>",
