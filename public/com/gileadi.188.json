In Jehovah&rsquo;s Day of Judgment, the world&rsquo;s wicked come under God&rsquo;s justice. Although Jehovah had offered mercy, promising deliverance to those who repent, they refused: &ldquo;I will destine you to the<em>sword<\/em> ; all of you shall succumb to the<em>slaughter<\/em> . For when I called, you did not respond; when I spoke, you would not give heed. You did what was evil in my eyes; you chose to do what was not my will&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4OTEwXQ==\">Isaiah 65:12<\/a> ; emphasis added).<\/p> ",
