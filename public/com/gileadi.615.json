    "html": "<p>The terms &ldquo;arrest&rdquo; and &ldquo;trial&rdquo; signify official prosecution at the hands of civil and\/or ecclesiastical authorities. These terms additionally accord with the pattern of a vassal king&rsquo;s prosecution by an emperor for his or his people&rsquo;s disloyalties to the emperor. In Jehovah&rsquo;s case, however, the disloyalties are not his own but those of his people for whom he is answerable to the emperor. His being &ldquo;cut off&rdquo; from the land of the living means that he is condemned to death, paradoxically by those for whose crimes and transgressions he fulfills the requirements of justice (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg1MzAiOjJ9LFsxODU1Nl0seyIxODg3NCI6NH1d\">Isaiah 43:24-25; 44:22; 63:7-10<\/a>).<\/p><p>As only Israel&rsquo;s God&mdash;not a man and not an animal&mdash;qualifies as an unblemished sacrifice for sin (cf. <a class=\"ref\">Exodus 12:5; Leviticus 1:3; 4:3<\/a>), and as only he can answer to all eternity as a vassal to an emperor under the terms of the Davidic Covenant (cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4Mzg4LDE4NzQ2XQ==\">Isaiah 37:35; 55:5<\/a>), the requirements of justice Jehovah discharges on behalf of his people are all-encompassing and infinite for those whom he saves (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NTE4LDE4NTc5LDE4NjgwLDE4NjgyXQ==\">Isaiah 43:12; 45:17; 51:6, 8<\/a>). But to apprise his generation&mdash;those whom he saves&mdash;of this demonstration of divine goodness is another matter, as few in this world comprehend or perceive its profound reality (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NzEzXQ==\">v 1<\/a>).<\/p>",
