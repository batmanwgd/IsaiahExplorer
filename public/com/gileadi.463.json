    "html": "<p>Continuous with Jehovah&rsquo;s re-creation of persons who attain Isaiah&rsquo;s seraphs level&mdash;who &ldquo;ascend as on eagles&rsquo; wings&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 40:31<\/a>)&mdash;appears Jehovah&rsquo;s end-time servant. The servant&rsquo;s attaining the seraph level (cf. <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 14:29; 51:9-10; 63:9<\/a>) thus forms a high point of Jehovah&rsquo;s narrowing creations as outlined in chapter 40. Personifying <em>righteousness<\/em> because he keeps Jehovah&rsquo;s law and word under all conditions, he serves as an exemplar of righteousness in a time of wickedness and self-righteousness, showing how all may ascend to the seraph level in accordance with Jehovah&rsquo;s &ldquo;plan&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 40:13<\/a>).<\/p><p>One persona under which the servant appears is that of a Righteous Warrior&mdash;Jehovah&rsquo;s <em>sword<\/em> and <em>bow<\/em>. In that respect, he emulates Jehovah, who also appears as a Righteous Warrior: &ldquo;Jehovah will come forth like a warrior, his passions aroused like a fighter; he will give the war cry, raise the shout of victory over his enemies (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 42:13<\/a>). When Jehovah empowers him, the servant reduces the enemies of his people to &ldquo;dust&rdquo; and &ldquo;stubble&rdquo;&mdash;to chaos, or nonentities&mdash;as he reconquers the world from the Assyrian power when its work of punishing the wicked is done (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTg0NjMiOjZ9LFsxNzgzNF0seyIxNzg3NSI6NH1d\">vv 11-16; Isaiah 9:4; 10:24-27<\/a>).<\/p><p>Jehovah&rsquo;s &ldquo;raising up&rdquo; his servant &ldquo;from the east&rdquo; and calling him &ldquo;to his foot&rdquo;&mdash;to the Promised Land&mdash;possesses word links to his &ldquo;raising up&rdquo; the servant in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxNzY1NiI6MzF9\">verse 25<\/a> and to his &ldquo;raising up&rdquo; the servant under his Cyrus persona (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 45:13<\/a>). It also synonymously parallels Jehovah&rsquo;s calling his servant from the east within a chiastic structure of alternating chaos and creation motifs that spans chapters 41-46: &ldquo;I summon a bird of prey from the east, from a distant land the man who performs my counsel&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 46:11<\/a>). Each of these depictions nuances the different tasks the servant performs.<\/p><p><em>He puts them to flight, passing on unhindered by paths his feet have never trod.<\/em> When reconquering the earth from the Assyrian alliance, Jehovah&rsquo;s servant and his seraph-associates exercise extraordinary divine powers over Jehovah&rsquo;s enemies: &ldquo;He will smite the earth with the <em>rod<\/em> of his <em>mouth<\/em> and with the <em>breath<\/em> of his <em>lips<\/em> slay the wicked. <em>Righteousness<\/em> will be as a band about his waist&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 11:4<\/a>; emphasis added); &ldquo;Assyria shall fall by a <em>sword<\/em> not of man; a <em>sword<\/em> not of mortals shall devour them: before that <em>sword<\/em> they shall waste away and their young men melt&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"bnVsbA==\">Isaiah 31:8<\/a>; emphasis added).<\/p>",
