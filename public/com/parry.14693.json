    "html": " <i>Lord of hosts.<\/i> The owner of the vineyard.<\/p> <p><i>vineyard\/pleasant plant.<\/i> The <i>vineyard<\/i> represents the house of Israel (5:3); the <i>pleasant plant<\/i> refers to the inhabitants of the kingdom of Judah.<\/p> <p> <i>looked for judgment\/righteousness.<\/i> God wanted his people to be just and righteous, but instead he found bloodshed and cries of distress. Isaiah's use of Hebrew terms in this verse demonstrates his brilliant and elegant literary style. Note the similarity between the Hebrew words for judgment (<i>mish<\/i><sup>e<\/sup>pat) and bloodshed (<i>mis<\/i><sup>e<\/sup>pach), righteousness (<i>ts<\/i><sup>e<\/sup>daqah) and cry (<i>ts<\/i><sup>e<\/sup>'aqah). Hence Isaiah's message is clear: the people chose <i>mis<\/i><sup>e<\/sup>pach (bloodshed) instead of <i>mish<\/i><sup>e<\/sup>pat (judgment), <i>ts<\/i><sup>e<\/sup>'aqah (crying) rather than <i>ts<\/i><sup>e<\/sup>daqah (righteousness).<\/p> ",
