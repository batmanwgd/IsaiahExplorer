    "html": "<p>Of himself, man is nothing: &ldquo;What is man that you are mindful of him, a human being that you should pay attention to him?&rdquo; (<a class=\"ref\">Psalm 8:4<\/a>); &ldquo;All flesh is grass, and at its best like a blossom of the field. Though the spirit of Jehovah breathe within it, the people themselves are but grass&mdash;grass that withers, flowers that fade. Only the word of our God endures forever&rdquo; (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODQyNyI6Mn0=\">Isaiah 40:6-7<\/a>). As Jehovah is no respecter of persons, man should not be either (<a class=\"ref\">Deuteronomy 1:17; Acts 10:34-35<\/a>). The things of this world are but a shadow of his. Preoccupation with what is of man robs a person of what is of God.<\/p>",
