    "html": "<p>While the worship of Jehovah goes on as if nothing has changed, its rituals have become a substitute for spirituality. As when Samuel rebukes Saul: &ldquo;Does Jehovah delight in burnt sacrifices and offerings as much as in heeding the voice of Jehovah? Listen up! To obey is better than sacrifice and to comply than the fat of rams&rdquo; (<a class=\"ref\">1 Samuel 15:22<\/a>). The purpose of temple worship&mdash;and the measure of one&rsquo;s devotion to God&mdash;isn&rsquo;t to multiply ordinances. It is to keep the terms of his covenant that assures Jehovah&rsquo;s people the same privileges enjoyed by ancestors who walked and talked with him.<\/p><p><em>Offerings of rams and fat of fatted beasts; the blood of bulls and sheep and he-goats.<\/em> The literalness of the animals&mdash;reflecting their ancient use as temple sacrifices&mdash;may seem to preclude their relevance to the end-time. Isaiah, however, uses ritually clean beasts as a metaphor of Jehovah&rsquo;s people (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W3siMTgzMDUiOjd9LFsxODQzMiwxODcxOV0seyIxODgyNSI6N31d\">Isaiah 34:1-7; 40:11; 53:7; 60:3-9<\/a>). In other words, just as sacrificial animals anciently served as proxies for Jehovah&rsquo;s people who transgressed&mdash;thereby forestalling God&rsquo;s justice&mdash;so their end-time relevance applies to the temple-goers themselves: <em>their<\/em> proxy rituals are no longer acceptable.<\/p>",
