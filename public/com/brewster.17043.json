The Lord declared himself to be <i>prudent<\/i>(<a class=\"ref\">2 Ne. 20:13<\/a>; <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODY0XQ==\">Isa. 10:13<\/a>); yet, he speaks harshly against those who are 'prudent in their own sight,' for the things of God shall be hid from them (<a class=\"ref\">2 Ne. 15:21<\/a>; <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzYxLDM5NDE5LDQxMDQyXQ==\">Isa. 5:21; D&amp;C 76:9; 128:18<\/a>). Webster states that one who is prudent is capable of directing or conducting oneself wisely and judiciously cautious, circumspect, and discreet in conduct. The 'prudent' against whom the Lord speaks are those who feign prudence or who appear to be 'prudent in their own sight' but are blind and 'looking beyond the mark,' which is the 'stone of Israel,' even Jesus the Christ (<a class=\"ref\">Jacob 4:14-16; D&amp;C 50:44<\/a>).\" (DCE, 447.)<\/p>",
