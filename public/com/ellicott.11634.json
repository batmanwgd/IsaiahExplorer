All true servants know what it is to feel as if the light for which they looked had for a time failed them, to utter a prayer like that of Ajax, \u201cGive light, and let us die\u201d (Hom. Il. xvii. 647). The Servant felt it when he uttered the cry, \u201cMy God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?\u201d (<a class=\"ref\">Matthew 27:46<\/a>). For such an one there were the words of counsel, \u201cTrust, in spite of the darkness.\u201d So the cry of the forsaken Servant was followed by the word \u201cFather, into thy hands I commend my spirit\u201d (<a class=\"ref\">Luke 23:46<\/a>).<\/p>",
