    "html": " <p>, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4ODU0XQ==\">Isaiah 61:10<\/a>. <i>I will greatly rejoice in the Lord <\/i>\u2014This is spoken in the person of the church, wherein she thankfully acknowledges God\u2019s kindness to her in the fore-mentioned promises. <i>My soul shall be joyful in my God <\/i>\u2014The expression here is varied, but the sense is the same with that in the former clause. <i>He hath clothed me with the garments of salvation,<\/i>,&c.\u2014With salvation as with a garment, and with righteousness as with a robe: the salvation that God will work for me will render me as beautiful and considerable as they are that are clothed with the richest garments. <i>As the bridegroom decketh himself with ornaments <\/i>\u2014Hebrew, <span class=\"hebrew_text\">,\u05d9\u05db\u05d4\u05df \u05e4\u05d0\u05e8 <\/span> <\/p>\n <p> <span class=\"hebrew_text\">,\u05db\u05d7\u05ea\u05df<\/span>, <i>as the bridegroom decketh himself with a priestly crown;<\/i>, so Bishop Lowth translates it, observing that it is \u201can allusion to the magnificent dress of the high-priest when performing his functions, and particularly to the mitre, and crown, or plate of gold on the front of it, <a class=\"ref\">Exodus 29:6<\/a>. The bonnet or mitre of the priests also was made, as Moses expresses it, <i>\u2018for glory<\/i>, and <i>for beauty,\u2019<\/i>, <a class=\"ref\">Exodus 28:40<\/a>. It is difficult to give its full force to the prophet\u2019s metaphor in another language: the version of Aquila and Symmachus comes nearest to it: <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u03c9\u03c2 \u03bd\u03c5\u03bc\u03c6\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd \u03b9\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03b5\u03c5\u03bf\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd <\/span> <\/p>\n <p> <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03c6\u03b1\u03bd\u03c9<\/span>,\u201d <i>as a bridegroom exercising the priest\u2019s office in a crown. <\/i> <\/p>",
