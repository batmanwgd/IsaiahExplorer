    "html": " <p> <em>Ye that go down to the sea\u2014<\/em>, This seems not to belong to this place; it does not well consist with what follows, \"and the fullness thereof.\" They that go down upon the sea means navigators, sailors, traders, such as do business in great waters; an idea much too confined for the prophet, who means the sea in general, as it is used by the Hebrews, for the distant nations, the islands, the dwellers on the sea-coasts all over the world. I suspect that some transcriber had the <a class=\"ref\">Psalm 107:23<\/a>; verse of Psalm 107 running in his head, <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d1\u05d0\u05e0\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea \u05d4\u05d9\u05dd \u05d9\u05d5\u05e8\u05d3\u05d9 <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, yoredey haiyam booniyoth<\/span>, and wrote in this place <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d4\u05d9\u05dd \u05d9\u05d5\u05e8\u05d3\u05d9 <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, yoredey haiyam<\/span>, instead of <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d4\u05d9\u05dd \u05d9\u05e8\u05e2\u05dd <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, yiram haiyam<\/span>, or <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d9\u05e8\u05d9\u05e2 <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, yari<\/span>, or <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d9\u05e8\u05df <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, yaran<\/span>,; \"let the sea roar, or shout, or exult.\" But as this is so different in appearance from the present reading, I do not take the liberty of introducing it into the translation. <i>Conjeceram legendum <\/i> <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d9\u05d2\u05d9\u05d3\u05d5 <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, yegidu<\/span>, <i>ut<\/i>, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDkzXQ==\">Isaiah 42:12<\/a>; <i>sed non favent Versiones<\/i>,. \"I would propose to read <span class=\"greek-hebrew\">,\u05d9\u05d2\u05d9\u05d3\u05d5 <\/span> <span class=\"translit\">, yegidu<\/span>, as in <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4NDkzXQ==\">Isaiah 42:12<\/a>; but this is not supported by the Versions.\" - Secker. <\/p>",
