Or do we hope that he will delay his coming, so that we might have longer to repent? Isaiah acknowledges our weakness and sinfulness, but he also knows\u2014as we should\u2014that if we will submit ourselves to him in all things, we can trust in his mercy. And, in the end, the Lord will bring with him blessings that exceed our greatest imaginings.<\/i><\/p> ",
