    "html": " <p>These verses reveal the judgment of destruction, which Isaiah lived to witness, against Philistia. The Philistines were long-time enemies of Israel, and warfare between the two peoples had gone on for centuries. (See <a class=\"ref\">Bible Dictionary, s.v. &ldquo;Philistines.&rdquo; <\/a>) They controlled parts of the Holy Land&rsquo;s coastal regions, though their power waned considerably from the time of David on. In Roman times, the Holy Land was known as Judea until the Jewish revolt of <small> A.D. <\/small> 132&ndash;35, after which the Emperor Hadrian changed the name to Syria Palaestina to show the Jews that they had no claim there any longer. <\/p> <p>The King James Version used the Latin form and called it &ldquo;Palestina,&rdquo; but what is meant is the Philistines, not Palestine, as the terms are used today. <\/p> <p>The Assyrian emperor Tiglath-pileser captured the Philistines about the time of the death of Ahaz, king of Judah, who had made an alliance with him. In spite of the hatred of the Philistines and their persecution of Israel, the Lord&rsquo;s people were established in the land. In like manner will Zion be established while all her enemies (Babylon, Assyria, Philistia, and so on) will be powerless to make it otherwise, but they will fall. <\/p> <p class=\"cite\"> LDS Church Educational System Old Testament Student Manual, 1 Kings&ndash;Malachi, Religion 302, Chapter 14, Item 16 <\/p> ",
