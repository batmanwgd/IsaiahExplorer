    "html": " <i>hate robbery for burnt offering.<\/i> Other translations read, \"I hate robbery and iniquity\" or \"robbery and wrong,\" without a reference to offerings. But the translation here is a reminder of Malachi's scathing \"Will a man rob God?&hellip;In tithes and offerings\" (<a class=\"ref\">Mal. 3:8<\/a>). Certainly God would be displeased if we were to offer that which we had gained by theft. But giving to the Lord only part of what he is due is another form of robbery. With burnt offerings in ancient times, the sacrifice was total, with nothing held back. The Lord requires full obedience to his laws; only complete commitment merits the desired blessings.<\/p> <p><i>I will direct their work in truth.<\/i> The Lord is the head of his church and the director of the covenant people. As a God of truth, he leads his people to proceed in the spirit of truth and obedience in all they do for him.<\/p> <p><i>everlasting covenant.<\/i> The Lord will make the righteous his covenant people (55:3; 59:21). The <i>everlasting covenant <\/i>is the gospel with all its requirements of man and its promises from God.<\/p> ",
