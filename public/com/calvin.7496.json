    "html": " <p> <i>Therefore thus saith Jehovah. <\/i> He now returns to the deliverance of which he had formerly spoken; for God proraised, first, that he would drive out Sennacherib; secondly, that he would grant food and nourishment for the sustenance of the people, though the country had been wasted and pillaged; and, thirdly, that he would cause flint small number to grow into a vast multitude. Having made these declarations, he returns to the first, because without it all the rest might appear to be useless; that is, if the people were not rescued from the hands, of that tyrant. <\/p> \n <p> <i>He shall not enter into the city. <\/i> God threatens that he will be as a fortress, to hinder him from \u201centering into the city,\u201d and that he will even meet him, so as to hinder him from coming nearer or fighting against it; for he says that he shall not <i>cast an arrow <\/i> nor a <i>balister. <\/i> I think that in this passage <span class=\"greek-hebrew\"> \u05e1\u05dc\u05dc\u05d4 <\/span> <i>(solelah) <\/i> denotes a balister, or some such machine for throwing darts, rather than a <i>mound; <\/i> for \u201cmounds\u201d are not thrown or poured. <\/p> ",
