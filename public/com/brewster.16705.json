(<a class=\"ref\">Genesis 19<\/a>.) Even as the men of Sodom publicly announced their sins, so shall the countenance of the wicked \"declare\" (show) their sins. Perhaps another meaning to be considered in the context of sins \"even as Sodom\" is the public campaign by some in these latter days to legalize and make acceptable that which God has declared abominable. (See BICQ, 39-49.)<\/p>",
