(Comp.<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3ODA1XQ==\">Isaiah 7:22<\/a> .) Fields and vineyards should be left uncultivated (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzQ5XQ==\">Isaiah 5:9<\/a>), and instead of bread and meat, and wine and oil, the people, flying from their cities and taking refuge in caves and mountains, should be left to the food of a nomadic tribe, such, e.g., as the Kenites (<a class=\"ref\">Judges 5:25; 1 Samuel 14:26; Matthew 3:4<\/a>).
