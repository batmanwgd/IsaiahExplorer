    "html": " <p>Distress of Ariel, or Jerusalem, on Sennacherib's invasion, with manifest allusion, however, to the still greater distress which it suffered from the Romans, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODE5NSI6NH0=\">Isaiah 29:1-4 <\/a>. Disappointment and fall of Sennacherib described in terms, like the event, the most awful and terrible, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODE5OSI6NH0=\">Isaiah 29:5-8 <\/a>. Stupidity and hypocrisy of the Jews, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODIwMyI6OH0=\">Isaiah 29:9-16 <\/a>. Rejection of the Jews, and calling of the Gentiles, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE4MjExXQ==\">Isaiah 29:17 <\/a>. The chapter concludes by a recurrence to the favourite topics of the prophet, viz., the great extension of the Messiah's kingdom in the latter days, and the future restoration of Israel, <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODIxMiI6N30=\">Isaiah 29:18-24 <\/a>. <\/p> \n\n <p>The subject of this and the four following chapters is the invasion of Sennacherib; the great distress of the Jews while it continued; their sudden and unexpected deliverance by God's immediate interposition in their favor; the subsequent prosperous state of the kingdom under Hezekiah; interspersed with severe reproofs, and threats of punishment, for their hypocrisy, stupidity, infidelity, their want of trust in God, and their vain reliance on the assistance of Egypt; and with promises of better times, both immediately to succeed, and to be expected in the future age. The whole making, not one continued discourse, but rather a collection of different discourses upon the same subject; which is treated with great elegance and variety. Though the matter is various, and the transitions sudden, yet the prophet seldom goes far from his subject. It is properly enough divided by the chapters in the common translation. - L. <\/p> ",
