    "html": "<p>Moab&rsquo;s three-year lease of time in which to mend its ways applies to Greater Babylon in general. In his long-suffering, Jehovah sends the world three years of warning through his servant before his Day of Judgment commences (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"eyIxODAzMSI6Nn0=\">Isaiah 20:1-6<\/a>). Then, in a long-awaited reversal of circumstances, Greater Babylon&rsquo;s glory turns to ignominy while Zion&rsquo;s ignominy turns to glory (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"W1sxODYwMV0seyIxODY5OCI6M31d\">Isaiah 47:1; 52:1-3<\/a>). Although Greater Babylon comprises a majority of the world&rsquo;s population, it boasts of no righteous surviving remnant (<a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3OTI2LDE3OTUxLDE4MDQ1XQ==\">Isaiah 13:19; 14:22; 21:9<\/a>). The few souls of Moab who remain alive aren&rsquo;t noteworthy.<\/p> ",
