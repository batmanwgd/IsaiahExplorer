Frequent mention (as we have seen) is made of the rich ointments of the spouse in the Song of Solomon; and the preparation for Esther\u2019s being introduced to King Ahasuerus was a course of bathing and perfuming for a whole year; <i>six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with sweet odours, <\/i> <a class=\"ref\">Esther 2:12 <\/a>. A diseased and loathsome habit of body, instead of a beautiful skin, softened and made agreeable with all that art could devise, and all that nature, so prodigal, in those countries, of the richest perfumes, could supply, must have been a punishment the most severe and the most mortifying to the delicacy of these haughty daughters of Zion. <i>And, instead of well-girt raiment, rags; and, instead of high- dressed hair, baldness; and, instead of a zone, a girdle of sackcloth: a sun-burnt skin, instead of beauty, <\/i> <a class=\"isa\" verses=\"WzE3NzMyXQ==\">Isaiah 3:24 <\/a>. <\/p> ",
