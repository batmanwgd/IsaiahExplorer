Anciently, after the bread corn was spread upon the threshing floor, a threshing instrument or cart wheel was rolled over it, bruising but not crushing the kernels. The farmer did not spend too much time threshing (\"he will not ever be threshing\"), lest the wheel of the cart or the horsemen crush the kernels.<\/p> ",
