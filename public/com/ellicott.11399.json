To St. Paul and those who share his faith death is to \u201cdepart, and to be with Christ\u201d ( <a class=\"ref\">Philippians 1:23<\/a>), to be \u201cever with the Lord\u201d ( <a class=\"ref\">1 Thessalonians 4:17<\/a>). To Hezekiah, it would seem, the outward worship of the Temple, or possibly, the consciousness of God\u2019s presence in the full activity of brain and heart, was a joy which he could not bear to lose. The spiritual perceptions of the life after death would be spectral and shadowy, like the dead themselves. (Comp. the Greek idea of Hades in Homer (Od. xi. 12-19). It may be noted that the Hebrew for \u201cthe Lord\u201d is the shorter, possibly the poetical, form \u201cJah\u201d (as in <a class=\"ref\">Psalms 68:4<\/a>). The LXX paraphrases \u201cI shall not see the salvation of God.\u201d<\/p> ",
